- Allow `lang` to run with multiple references (allows multithreading)
- use `const` when applicable

- TODO:
    - finish the finite context model (freeze the model after training on the reference, but still consider the target alphabet!)
        - have to make sure probability distributions are handled properly (only consider characters from the target alphabet, but use information trained on the reference)
    - investigate different threshold strategies for `locatelang`
    - investigate uniform vs frequency distribution for `locatelang`. The idea is that greek and bulgarian will not have such an information discrepancy compared to the other languages since the default distribution for all reference languages *should be the same*!
