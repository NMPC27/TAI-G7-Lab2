## Repository structure

**TODO**

## Requirements
CMake >= 3.10

## Building

In order to build the project, first create a build directory and generate a CMake native build environment. If using Linux, run:

```
mkdir release
cd release
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
```

For a debug build, run the following:

```
mkdir debug
cd debug
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```

After that, build the binaries, within the `release`/`debug` directory:

```
cmake --build .
```

The generated binaries **TODO** will be present in the `bin` folder.

## Usage
