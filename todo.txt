- check why using the uniform distribution produces an information valley on *all* references
- investigate different threshold strategies for `locatelang` (use 2 thresholds at the same time)
- LOW PRIORITY: use `const` when applicable (for performance)?
- MostCommonCopyPointerManager, CircularArrayCopyPointerManager and RecentCopyPointerManager all behave the same, for a given pattern, once the model is trained on the reference, i.e. they always produce the same output.
  This is important, because MostCommonCopyPointerManager performs a majority algorithm every time it finds a pattern, but the result will always be the same
- Preprocess the references? (such as removing newlines)
