- CircularArrayCopyPointerManager goes out of bounds when evaluating en+pt.utf8 with EN reference! (at ~70% progress)
- fix finite context model memory usage and performance
- check why using the uniform distribution produces an information valley on *all* references
- investigate different threshold strategies for `locatelang` (use 2 thresholds at the same time)
- LOW PRIORITY: use `const` when applicable (for performance)?
