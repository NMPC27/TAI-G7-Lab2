'A bit of a shame' because, even though the public finance situation in the Member States is complicated, we should have done everything in our power to reinvest the revenue collected for the benefit of, for example, trans-European transport network (TEN-T) priority projects.
'Believes that both business-to-business and business-to-consumer contracts should be covered; emphasises that the [optional instrument] must offer a very high level of consumer protection, in order to compensate consumers for the protection that they would normally enjoy under their national law; wishes for further explanation on how this could be achieved'.

'Supports action to address the range of barriers faced by those who wish to enter into cross-border transactions in the Internal Market and considers that, along with other measures, the European contract law project could be useful for realising the full potential of the Internal Market';
'Territorial cooperation' has become one of the three pillars of EU cohesion policy, succeeding the Community initiative INTERREG.
'Territorial cooperation' is one of the pillars of the EU's cohesion policy, which aims to remove the physical, administrative and regulatory obstacles and reduce the 'border effect' between territories and regions, with a view to promoting a harmonious development that enables them to address their shared challenges together.
'That the spirit of revolutionary change which has long been disturbing the nations of the world should have passed beyond the sphere of politics and made its influence felt in the related sphere of practical economics is not surprising'. These are the words of the beloved Pope John Paul II who, in his encyclical entitled Centesimus Annus, reprised the subjects tackled by his predecessor Leo XIII in the encyclical Rerum Novarum.
'The Commission recalls its commitment towards ensuring that Member States establish correlation tables linking the transposition measures they adopt to the EU directive and that they communicate them to the Commission in the framework of transposing EU legislation in the interests of citizens, better law making and increasing legal transparency, and to assist in the examination of the conformity of national rules with EU provisions.

'The Commission regrets the lack of support for the provision included in the proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on consumer rights, amending Council Directive 93/13/EEC and Directive 1999/44/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Directive 85/577/EEC and Directive 97/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, which aimed at rendering the establishment of correlation tables obligatory.
'The Commission, in a spirit of compromise and in order to ensure the immediate adoption of that proposal, can accept the substitution of the obligatory provision on correlation tables included in the text with a relevant recital encouraging Member States to follow this practice.
'The Council considers that transparency should guide relations with interest representatives and that the Register provides a useful basis on which to build and interact with them in an open, inclusive and consistent fashion.

2011 is a strategic moment to draw lessons from the four years of operation of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI). The Commission has announced that it will present its proposals for the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the post-2013 period before the summer recess and the legislative proposals for the financing instruments for external action later this year.

66th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (
A Europe that belongs to its citizens can only work as a Europe of homelands, subsidiarity and national sovereignty.
A European asylum system based on the central principles of humanitarianism and muddling through is to be firmly rejected.
A better relationship is essential between the academic, research and industrial worlds to enable research results to be converted more effectively into products and services, generating economic growth and benefits for society as a whole.
A broad-brush approach will not work in this case because it is clear that the problem lies with certain Member States.
A business may say that it is socially responsible when it commits to a robust structure that is capable of taking account not only of economic outcomes, but also of the social and environmental results of its actions.
A characteristic feature of this debate is not only the fact that ever more people are criticising the budget, but also that the results are quite obviously better, for example in respect of cohesion policy, where clear improvements have been made, albeit improvements which have gone unnoticed by the critics of the European budget. I would also like to draw attention to the fact that these positive results must now also be integrated into our considerations regarding future action, or in other words the type of action that must be continued and the regulations that must be introduced, in particular with regard to the recovery of funds.
A concluding remark on Croatia. I think that it is time and it is appropriate to congratulate Croatia, because it is approaching a historical moment and I believe that this should give a very positive signal, not only for all Croatians, but for all the peoples of the western Balkans.
A coordinated approach within a general European Union legal framework is essential to prevent problems and future financial crises and to allow the banks to operate in a more orderly fashion and under the same conditions throughout Europe. I am of the opinion that, in order to ensure transparency, regulators should be continually developing standard rules and procedures.
A dialogue on visas is another measure that would have a clear stabilising influence that would also promote reforms.
A few short weeks after the natural and nuclear catastrophe in Japan, the European right has had the cranky notion of threatening the Japanese Government.
A final thought, Mr President: populism is being mentioned, because populism is not combated by imitating its half-hearted solutions but, quite the contrary, by confronting it with solutions for the future and not the past.
A foreign policy like the one that the Union is proposing to develop cannot neglect the cultural dimension, but rather must keep it in mind as an asset; as a value that is not always tangible but is particularly important in a world increasingly susceptible to the 'soft power' of states and international organisations.
A free trade agreement (FTA) between the European Union and India could be a successful conclusion to the process of commercial interaction which has been deepening in recent times. I hope that, as well as sharing values, the EU and India will continue trying to understand each other better and benefiting from this deeper understanding, as well as from any profits that may result from this contact.
A fundamental requirement for fair competition on the internal market is the establishment of fair and transparent conditions for all farmers throughout the EU. The report on the future of the common agricultural policy (CAP) is heading in this direction.
A group of experts funded by the European Commission recommended an international study should be conducted, which would investigate all the effects that the Chernobyl disaster has had on human health.
A joint statement by the European Parliament and the Council. 'The European Parliament and the Council are mindful of the importance of providing accurate information to consumers, in particular, when products are marketed with an indication of origin so as to protect them against fraudulent, inaccurate or misleading claims.
A lot has already been said about the successes.
A major transformation of the world order is taking place, challenging the European Union to engage more actively with current and emerging world powers and with other bilateral and multilateral partners, in order to promote effective solutions to problems which affect both EU citizens and the world at large.
A more balanced approach has allowed us to have a joint motion for a resolution today which will be constructive and targeted at the opportunities for closer cooperation between Ukraine and the European Union, while judicial reform is carried out in the country and the anti-corruption measures implemented.
A necessary component of effective enforcement is that the courts may, as an interim measure, act swiftly to order disclosure and freezing of the debtor's assets.
A new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe (continuation of debate) 
A new protocol for the period 2011-2014 will be applied on a provisional basis, and I believe this to be sufficient at the present time.
A number of old stagers amongst us know that we have already been fighting hard for this since 2006, when Mrs Wortmann-Kool led the previous review.
A number of votes and declarations have proven that there is consensus within the EU on various aspects of this fund.
A positive vote tomorrow will allow the joint launching of the register by our two institutions to take place in June.
A profound change in current trade policy is urgently needed, steering international trade towards complementarity and not competition, towards the establishment of fair and equitable economic relationships that are mutually advantageous, and which serve the development of countries and their peoples, and not just a few companies and financial institutions.
A properly functioning procurement market is of crucial importance to promoting the Single Market, to stimulating innovation, to promoting a high level of environmental and climate protection, and of social inclusion across the EU, and to achieving the highest possible value for public authorities, citizens and taxpayers.
A properly functioning procurement market is of essential importance in order to foster the Single Market, to stimulate innovation, to boost employment, growth and competitiveness, to promote higher levels of environmental and climate protection and protect social rights throughout the EU, and to achieve optimal value for public authorities, citizens and taxpayers.
A recent study highlights that in the United States, almost half of the samples of meat tested in stores contained Staphylococcus aureus, half of which were resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics.
A reformed CAP with a greener first pillar, introducing non-contractual and annual environmental actions that go beyond cross-compliance, and a second pillar more focused on climate action, supported by a professional farm advisory service, could be tailored towards helping farmers to manage their land-use systems so as to contribute to climate action (mitigation), and also become less vulnerable to climate change (adaptation). That is definitely what we intend to achieve through the next CAP.
A responsible and flexible attitude is required of both the Council and Parliament, and I firmly believe that in today's situation, the agreement would send a remarkably positive message to the markets as well.
A scientifically sound approach to the shortage of resources and to the ecosystem is crucial to the sustainable economic development of the European Union.
A second issue that is different and that we have difficulty in accepting concerns spectrum for broadband satellite access; the Commission wants to be able to actually ensure its availability.
A simple comparison with a few other countries makes it clear that we could be better. I would just like to refer once again to the example of the United States.
A sort of automatic mechanism was used to show that if energy efficiency was added to the 20% reduction in CO2 emissions then 25% would automatically be possible.
A special thanks to this House for producing such an excellent report - the Járóka report - and the decision, which was an excellent base for our work in the Council.
A study of the possibility of banning the use of antimicrobials in animal feed is therefore urgently needed, as is promotion of measures to reduce resistance to antibiotics, thereby ensuring better animal health and increased food safety.
A sufficiently long transition is needed to make the open-ended duality in EU investment policy unacceptable for Parliament, as the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union states that investment policy is fully within the competence of the European Union.
A swift and effective response by you, Commissioner, on this point would send a signal that would also help strengthen what we know are historically fragile links between the Commission and the profession.
A total of EUR 427 billion in outstanding demands have now accumulated between the central banks in the accounts of the European Central Bank system and the TARGET2 payment transaction system; this is because the system has intervened between the central banks in place of the non-functioning markets.
A transparent process must be used for informing the general public.
A very large number of companies in the EU carry out their business activities within the Internal Market, while European citizens enjoy the right to settle, work or travel freely throughout the EU. As we also pointed out when we discussed the Single Market Act intended to deepen the Internal Market and promote cross-border transactions, including e-commerce, we need guarantees to be able to recover any cross-border debts. I fully support the notion in this report of asking the Commission to propose more effective instruments for implementing the legislation, to supplement those which already exist for dealing with cross-border claims, such as the Brussels I Regulation or the Small Claims Procedure.
A very wide majority of the European Parliament approved Mrs Matera's report calling for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to the tune of EUR 9.5 million for the closing of the General Motors (GM) - Opel plant in Antwerp (Belgium). I voted against this report because it finances the laying-off of 2 834 employees of a company that received a USD 5 billion loan from the US authorities during the summer of 2010.
A week ago, the UN General Assembly authorised the EU to speak with one voice at its meetings.
AMR in humans is often caused by inadequate doses of antibiotic medicines, whose transmission of pathogenic bacteria constitutes a particular threat to farmers and farm workers, who are in daily contact with animals.
Above all, EU policy should be measured by the progress made in improving the well-being of Europeans.
Above all, I welcome the fact that, when applying the regulation on government debt, the Commission will have to take into account 'all other relevant factors', in particular private debt, and other important factors allowing for an overall assessment to be made. I hope that Parliament will reach a final agreement and approve the entire governance package as quickly as possible, in order to send a strong and unified message to the public and the markets and to stop speculation.
Above all, any new system for financing the budget should not increase the burden on national treasuries or the tax burden for citizens.
Above all, in the countries with the greatest financial difficulties, it should commit to investment in public services, to supporting production, to creating jobs with rights, to eradicating poverty, and to combating social inequality and all types of discrimination, not least gender.
Above all, the European Union must refrain from taking sides in the conflict.
Above all, the proposed candidate has political experience, and also auditing and financial experience, although the latter is perhaps not as strong as might be hoped. I am voting in favour of this candidate, but I believe that more thought needs to be given to the type of qualifications that Members of the Court of Auditors ought to have.
Above all, these aspects must be laid down in such a way that there are consequences if they are not complied with. I do not at all mean this to sound schoolmasterish towards our Indian friends.
Above all, this regulation should provide for requirements to indicate non-textile parts of animal origin when labelling or marking textile products, so that consumers can make a choice on the basis of the information in their possession.
Above all, this would remove obstacles often faced by consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Single Market relating to the complexity of contractual relations.
Above all, we are concerned that we are going to repeal regulations that are useful for customs control without there being any progress at the moment on the 'Made in' origin marking regulation, which is currently at a standstill in the Commission because of the Council's obstructionism. I would also like to point out that the Council has vetoed origin markings in relation to the ad hoc textile measure and is trying to do the same as regards the mandatory indication of place of origin on food labels.
Absolutely right. I was not suggesting my politicians were any less stupid than anybody else.
Accelerated growth in Central Europe also makes a significant contribution to growth throughout Europe and improves investment conditions, yielding profits not only in Warsaw and Prague, but also in Amsterdam, London and Berlin.
Access to Early Years Learning is of vital importance to young children in terms of their receptiveness and willingness to learn, especially since important skills such as the ability to speak and develop social skills are formed at a young age.
Access to financial support must be improved for new innovative businesses in the form of start-up funds.
Access to professional education should respond to the particular needs of individuals, and thus make it easier for them to find a job.
Access to the radio spectrum is essential to ensure that all European citizens, whether in rural or urban areas, have access to digital technologies and broadband, with the total turnover of this industry representing approximately EUR 200 billion.
Accession to the Schengen acquis involves the need to comply with various evaluation procedures: candidate countries have to comply with a range of conditions in order to be admitted to the area of freedom of movement, which currently covers 25 countries and 400 million Europeans.
According to 'Save the Children', the Indian non-governmental organisation, an estimated 60 million children still work today in fields, restaurants or factories in India. I deplore the fact that the conservative majority in the European Parliament has refused to face up to this state of affairs by rejecting an amendment which highlighted the European Parliament's concerns over the use of children for work, children who are frequently exploited in dangerous and unhealthy conditions.
According to Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union, the EU is formally committed to effective multilateralism, which has a powerful UN organisation as its focal point, making a vital contribution to tackling the global challenges.
According to Article 4(2) of the Act of Accession, 'the verification, through evaluation procedures, that the necessary conditions for the application of all parts of the Schengen acquis (data protection, the SIS, air borders, land borders, sea borders, police cooperation and visas) have been met by the new Member States is a precondition for the Council to decide on the abolition of checks at internal borders with those Member States'. According to the evaluation reports compiled by experts, both Romania and Bulgaria have shown that they are prepared to apply the provisions of the Schengen acquis in a satisfactory manner.
According to Cedefop's current Europe-wide skill supply and demand forecast, the number of new jobs up to 2020 is estimated at 80 million.
According to Cedefop, we can expect a 12 million decline in jobs available for low skilled or unskilled labour, which presages an increasing risk of poverty for the most vulnerable.
According to EU statistical data published last month, Lithuania is still trying to catch up - in Lithuania, 51.5% of CAP payments are going towards rural development, whereas in the EU27 the corresponding figure is 23.3%. We must continue to support our farmers' efforts to modernise their farms.
According to EU statistics, there are only two EU Member States where youth unemployment rates are higher than in Lithuania.
According to UN data, areas within a radius of 500 km from the power plant were contaminated.
According to current estimates, global navigation satellite systems are expected to earn the European economy between EUR 55 and 63 billion over the next 20 years.
According to data from a European Commission survey, only 10% of Europeans feel they are well informed about science, while 65% feel that governments should make more efforts to interest young people in scientific matters.
According to data from the World Bank, Lithuania has great potential to become a dynamic, knowledge-based economy.
According to data given in the 2009 report by the EMCDDA, it was shown that the situation has deteriorated, especially in relation to drugs such as cocaine and heroin, and to new synthetic drugs, and it has seen persistently high levels of consumption and a spiralling upward trend in this regard.
According to forecasts, economic problems will not change the fact that employment levels are rising in the EU, and should not give rise to a reduction in funding for the EU's key programmes in the field of vocational education and training, such as the 'Lifelong Learning' programme, for example.
According to future estimates relating to employability and required diplomas, there are allegedly 15.6 million new jobs within the EU for graduates and 3.7 million for those with a secondary education qualification (source: Cedefop). On the other hand, 12 million jobs are going to be cut for those with a lower level of qualification!
According to official statistics, the Russian economy is growing at a rate of 4%, despite the economic climate, and this is forecast to continue for a long time.
According to recent figures, 14.4% of young Europeans aged between 18 and 24 years dropped out of school before completing their secondary education, and less than one third of the European Union's population have a higher education qualification, compared with around 40% in the United States and 50% in Japan.
According to reports, Saleh was tortured after arrest and then taken to an unknown location in Khartoum, a personal tragedy that requires Europe to get involved.
According to statistics compiled by the Centre, 75 million Europeans have already tried cannabis and 14 million Europeans have already tried cocaine at least once.
According to the Act of Accession, verification, by means of evaluation procedures, that the necessary conditions for the application of all parts of the Schengen acquis (data protection, the SIS, air borders, land borders, sea borders, police cooperation and visas) have been met by the new Member States is a precondition for the Council to decide on the abolition of checks at internal borders with those Member States. I did not endorse this document because taking into account the results of the evaluations and the necessary revisits carried out by teams of experts, the committee responsible has concluded that there are some outstanding issues that will require regular reporting and a follow-up at some point in the future.
According to the Consultative Working Party, the proposal in question is a straightforward codification of existing texts, without any change in their substance.
According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, there are 400 000 patients in Europe infected with multi-resistant strains of bacteria. I therefore welcome the resolution of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in which I support, above all, the demand for the proper collection and analysis of comparable data on the sale of preparations for veterinary use, and the subsequent use of these preparations on animals.
According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), no general population survey on illicit drug use has been carried out in Croatia.
According to the Treaty of Lisbon, this falls within the competence of the EU. How should we handle this situation?
According to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the common commercial policy must be conducted 'in the context of the principles and objectives of the Union's external action' and must contribute 'inter alia, to sustainable development, the eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights'. As such, it is very important that the following not be forgotten in these negotiations: the use of child labour, and the failure to comply with international social and environmental standards, which constitutes a form of dumping, detrimental to European companies and workers.
According to the Treaty, taking into consideration objectives concerned with promoting a high level of employment, guaranteeing adequate social welfare and combating social exclusion is a cross-cutting aim that applies to this economic governance package also.
According to the World Bank's report, implementation of the European climate and energy package will mean a loss to the Polish economy of 1.4% of GDP annually until 2020, and a loss to the EU as a whole of 0.55%. The World Bank also estimates that electricity prices will rise by around 26.2% in Poland, and by 12.6% in the EU as a whole.
According to the account in the newspaper Le Monde, VAT fraud alone costs many billions of euro a year.
According to the conclusions of the 2009 European Innovation Panel, the recent economic and financial crisis has had disproportionate effects in different countries.
According to the evaluation reports, Romania has shown that it is sufficiently prepared to apply both the non-SIS related provisions of the Schengen acquis, as well as its SIS-related provisions, in a satisfactory manner.
According to the formal requirements, Bulgaria and Romania are ready for membership of the Schengen area and the European Council must decide in favour of this as soon as possible. I am counting on Mr Coelho's report being approved by a large majority to give a clear political signal to Member States.
According to the human rights documents currently in force in Europe, children are fully and actively engaged citizens with their own rights.
According to the joint report by experts from the EU and Canada, the conclusion of a Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement is intended to provide tangible economic benefits, which will result from trade liberalisation and the elimination of tariff barriers.
According to the latest information, this outbreak is responsible for 21 deaths in Germany and 1 in Sweden.
According to the new draft, registration is not obligatory, but currently, only the representatives of registered interest groups are allowed access to the premises of the European Parliament.
According to the new report by the UN, it is very likely that the Tamil Tigers and government troops will be found guilty of serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights committed in the final stages of the conflict.
According to the position of the UDMR (Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania), Romania and Bulgaria must receive a definite prospect in 2011 of joining this area of free movement. I do not think that the rules should be changed during the game, and the decision on joining the Schengen area must take into account what has been achieved under the Schengen Agreement and not be based on political assessments.
According to the rapporteur Mr Coelho, all the shortcomings which were identified in the past have been successfully rectified by the Romanian authorities.
According to the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs who have been monitoring this process, the outstanding issues, which will require regular reports and monitoring in the future, do not constitute an obstacle to these two Member States' full accession to the Schengen area.
According to the rapporteur, all parties, be it in business-to-business (B2B) or business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions, should be free to choose or not to choose the optional instrument (OI) as an alternative to national or international law (opt-in). Further attention is required to ensure that the OI offers protection to consumers and small businesses given their position as the weaker commercial partner and that any confusion is avoided when making a choice of law. I abstained from voting because the EU recently adopted the Rome I Regulation, which regulates this area and defends consumer rights well, whereas this proposal is purely based on the UK situation and would only cause turbulence and increased bureaucracy.
According to the rapporteur, everything, or almost everything, boils down to tired arguments about creating an effective and adequate governance system in terms of risk management, enforcement of rules, ethics in the behaviour of some of those involved in the financial markets and institutions, and so on.
According to the rapporteur, the Agreement could also increase safety, as regulators and enforcement authorities are moving closer to cooperation in all matters of certification, inspections and enforcement, in order to ensure the highest level of safety for passengers and cargo flights.
According to the report, everything should remain as it is: more money has been requested for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, no reforms of the Structural Funds have been proposed, nowhere are there any concrete proposals for more efficiency.
According to the report, he was acting in performance of his duties as Member of the European Parliament and carrying out political activities by expressing his opinion on a matter of public interest to his constituents.
According to the target set in 2002, EU Member States must offer early years education to 90% of children between the age of three and the compulsory school age.
According to this evaluation, and in line with the trends of recent years, there has been a reduction in the reference tonnage.
Accordingly we must also investigate other risks, such as plane crashes, terrorist attacks, computer attacks, in other words this combination of attacks on nuclear power plants; what is more, you must guarantee that this does not become simply a token gesture.
Accordingly, I should like to thank the rapporteur for his fairness in our cooperation.
Accordingly, the new CAP must strengthen its commitment to active farmers, and to the contributions that they make in terms of production and a balanced development of rural areas.
Accordingly, up-and-coming enterprises in the small and medium-sized business sector must be strongly incentivised.
Accordingly, we must assess expected conditions and specific circumstances and determine what we have to do to make sure that Europe exists and does not end up as a loser.
Account is taken of specific challenges such as: the demand for ever-increasing qualifications by the labour market, which puts low-skilled jobs at risk, the spiralling increase in youth unemployment, which is over 30% in certain EU Member States, including Greece, and the failure on the part of the Member States to take adequate measures to achieve the targets set in the EU 2020 strategy (for example, to reduce the percentage of early school leavers to 10% and to increase the percentage of young people with a university education to 40%). Alongside social protection for citizens with fewer skills or a low level of education, we urgently need investment in new skills, especially those required for jobs in strategic sectors as far as growth is concerned.
Account needs to be taken of the fact that Croatia will accede to the European Union in 2012 or 2013 and that, as a result of its geographical location, it represents a good trans-shipment point for drug dealers.
Accurate and adequate statistical data on energy and resource consumption are fundamental if we want to get indicators for progress and well-being beyond the GDP.
Achievement of this goal is closely linked to how predictable development aid is, since it is only on the basis of such aid, at the same time as mobilising domestic revenues, that partner countries can construct an adequate and effective development strategy.
Achieving and sustaining quality of life involves important factors such as health, education, culture, employment, housing and environmental conditions. I support the establishment of a solid legal framework for European environmental economic accounts and encourage the need to compile reliable, harmonised statistics.
Achieving social, economic and territorial cohesion is one of the important objectives of the European project.
Acknowledgement from the European Union's missions assessing the smooth operation and connection Romania and Bulgaria have to the Schengen Information System, which operates at the highest security standards, presents a strong argument in this respect.
Action needs to be taken immediately, especially where the level of youth unemployment is concerned.
Active SFM should be clearly mainstreamed and prioritised in research and practice, and should also take into account public ownership of 40% of EU forests.
Actually it is not uselessly.
Adapting to the times means taking into consideration all the important variables, without falling into the trap of creating an excessively artificial system, which would be difficult to apply. I believe that, with clearly defined indicators, the work can be carried out in the best possible way.
Added to all this, in the southern part of Sudan, there are large reserves of the oil that is fundamental to big international capital.
Added to this technological development time lag are the effects of the economic crisis, which has hit this industrial sector hard, causing a 20-25% fall in its turnover compared with 2008.
Added to which, despite the progress made in recent years, the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Framework Programme should be stepped up in order to develop the skills that would allow them to boost their competitiveness.
Adding a green component to the first pillar in conjunction with a stronger rural development policy is another key objective that will help to tackle climate change and environmental issues, but will also contribute to achieving the Europe 2020 strategy.
Adding further requirements would create a precedent of discrimination which has not existed before, not even after the great enlargement in 2007.
Additional checks will no doubt have to be envisaged before the conclusions of a national or regional health agency can be taken as read.
Additional mechanisms should be put in place to ensure they are provided with the same opportunities as anyone else.
Additionally, as a simultaneous by-product, and without incurring additional costs, we can obtain highly accurate geometrical databases that can be used to monitor and manage the artefact in the event of natural disasters, as well as products for scientific education and for promoting the artefact on a global scale, fulfilling criteria for cultural understanding and exchange
Additionally, its greatest beneficiaries are applicants from the so-called old EU Member States: Germany (23.1% of all those awarded funding), Spain (19.1%), the United Kingdom (9.9%) and the Netherlands (8.3%). Today, around one third of research is funded under the facility.
Addressing educational disadvantage by providing high quality early childhood education and targeted support, and by promoting inclusive education, are absolutely necessary to create a truly inclusive society.
Adjournment of the session
Adjustment to climate change could thus become an instrument for growth, generating hundreds of thousands of jobs as well as exports of advanced technology.
Admittedly, this text is far less ambitious than the initial proposal, but it will enable us for the first time to implement the 'polluter pays' principle and to internalise external transport costs such as noise and CO2 emissions.
Admittedly, we must strengthen the Growth and Stability Pact and deficits must be more closely monitored, and even penalised.
Adopting the resolution on the free trade agreement between the EU and India will help us take a step forward to fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals.
Adopting this ILO convention on domestic workers will be an essential element in ensuring that domestic workers' human, social and employment rights are respected.
Adoption of the economic governance package proves yet again that the European project is still alive and that it is on the basis of conciliation among the 27 that the Member States will overcome their difficulties and, at the same time, confront the challenges of the future.
Affordability is a concern, for example, for cultural organisations without a great deal of money which do not always have the funding to buy new equipment.
After 19 months of institutional crisis in the country, precisely on the day on which nearly 8 million Malagasy people were called on to vote on reforming the constitution, in November 2010, all hope of fashioning a genuine democracy in this former European colony was lost.
After 20 years, even Mr Medvedev had to admit that one cannot ignore the terrible and criminal heritage of Russian power. I recall the words of our colleague, Mr Swoboda, who yesterday asked for a full clearing up of Russian history, especially the atrocities of the Stalin era.
After Bulgaria and Romania have made great efforts and coped admirably with the Schengen technical criteria, delaying both countries' admission would run counter to the rules stipulated in the European Union.
After all this, it is high time the left wing stops its provocative political campaign based on misrepresentations against the Hungarian Government.
After all, a lot of medium-sized enterprises use vehicles in the 3.5 to 12 tonne range.
After all, even a state with 82 million people, such as the one I represent, will not survive intercontinental competition in the long term.
After all, it is in the interests of the Member States which are lagging behind EU research excellence to take advantage of resources from the European Structural Funds to strengthen their scientific and research sectors.
After all, it is the task of the Council and Parliament as the two colegislators to find a solution which satisfies the needs and expectations of European citizens through joint efforts.
After all, statistics can be sexy, particularly at a time when the European Union has a huge credibility problem where European citizens are concerned. I would say that that is largely unjustified if we look at the major issues and not at the other matters on which Mr Leinen and I are divided.
After all, that could only result in this right being restricted. I fail to see why I, as a Member of the European Parliament, would do that.
After all, the facilitation of trade in the area of textiles, leather and ethanol that you now want to offer to Pakistan would undermine the GSP+ (Generalised System of Preferences+) status that countries like Bangladesh have attained, and indeed, in contrast to Pakistan, they have attained it through ratification of important UN and ILO conventions for the rights of workers and environmental protection.
After all, their primary role is to produce food.
After all, this is a country which, like all EU countries, enjoys membership of the Council of Europe and is part of our eastern EU partnership.
After all, this is money that the Member States receive back and would very much like to have. I therefore also think that it is necessary for us to have this possibility of a 5% rise, so that there is the opportunity for new policy areas and for meeting new demands, as well as for investing in transport, energy and research - areas that the EU must invest in in future.
After all, we need facts in order to be able to take politically sound decisions.
After all, we recall that, in all the discussions held by the Troikas travelling to the various Member States that we are trying to help, ultimately, it is the IMF - and it almost pains me to say this after everything that we Greens said about the IMF in the 1980s and 1990s - that is the most reasonable today, while the Commission and the Central Bank are the ones setting the toughest conditions.
After all, when you were the leader of the UK House of Lords, and you pushed through the Lisbon Treaty, which created your GBP 313 000-a-year job, you actually said, over and over again, that this was just a tidying-up exercise and not a significant transfer of sovereignty.
After all, with every day that we fail to provide aid, we as Europeans are losing the trust of Pakistan in particular and we will ultimately pay a high political price for this.
After analysing the input that we have received on this topic from all the stakeholders, and following the public consultation with the stakeholders, we are about to put forward recommendations on how we should strengthen and support cultural and creative industries in order to develop and produce the results that we expect them to.
After around a year's work, the special committee on policy challenges and budgetary resources has finally presented the future decisions determining priorities in expenditure for the efficient and effective use of European Union appropriations leading to the implementation of result-oriented policies.
After careful assessment of the Agency's budget, the Court of Auditors, which is responsible for external financial control, declared that it has obtained reasonable assurances as to the legality and reliability of the pertinent transactions. I believe, however, that the request made to the Agency to make efforts to improve its budgetary and recruitment planning is absolutely fair.
After considering the reasons for and against defending the Member's parliamentary immunity, I agree with the recommendation of the Committee on Legal Affairs that Parliament should not defend the immunity of Bruno Gollnisch.
After consultations with consumer associations, European Blind Union representatives and the vending machines industry, research was carried out to take into account the specific requirements of important categories of coin users.
After consulting consumer-rights organisations and representatives from the business world, I understand that we must insist on yet greater harmonisation of consumer rights across the European Union.
After five years, we will know whether it is working and then this credit rating foundation will also have to pay back the funds that it has received.
After listening attentively to the Members, we are pleased to say that there is indeed complete agreement on the principles.
After many years of pushing and cajoling, we finally seem to be taking this step towards sustainable national accounts and that is highly necessary as - let us be entirely honest - the economic system that we have at the moment is simply not working.
After more than three years of talks on the free trade agreement, the EU and India are at a crucial stage, completing negotiations on the most important sectors.
After several reports and thorough discussions, the Parliament launched its register for interest representatives in 1996.
After six years of negotiations, the time has come for recognition to be given to Croatia's efforts in meeting the accession criteria. I hope that in 2013 we can welcome Croatia as the 28th Member State.
After the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force on 1 December 2009, there was an extension of the conditions under which the consent of Parliament was required for signing international agreements.
After the accident, we contributed to joint research projects with the Commonwealth of Independent States in supporting the gathering of extensive data and the designing of strategies for disaster management in the nuclear sector and in the relevant areas in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.
After the adoption of a general approach by the Council in March, we got down to business immediately, engaging in intense trialogue negotiations with Parliament and the Commission.
After the end of the war, the Sri Lankan President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, promised to investigate all suspected violations of military law and international humanitarian law during the military conflict.
After the excellent hearing held at the parliamentary Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I hereby put forward with conviction my vote in favour of the nomination of Mario Draghi to the European Central Bank (ECB). My vote is confirmation that, in this time of difficulty and crisis, the person most suited and qualified to direct the ECB has been elected. I am convinced that Mario Draghi will know how to manage this future role as President of the ECB, as he has proved in his time at the Bank of Italy, and that he will do so by offering to Europe his wealth of experience and great competence.
After the failure of the so-called 'Lisbon strategy', which aimed for the EU to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010, we decided to consider whether the review of FP7 might offer an opportunity to consolidate the golden triangle of knowledge, education and research.
After the floods, Pakistan had already been helped by Europe with almost half a billion euros.
After the great imperialist powers have finished carving up the African continent in their own interests, everything points to the belief that a process has been restarted in South Sudan which will lead to more wars and suffering for the already severely devastated populations of Africa.
After the incident in Fukushima in Japan, the EU must equip itself with ambitious standards and framework treaties in matters concerning nuclear power and energy policy. I voted in favour of the Cizelj report on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste from the energy, medical and research sectors.
After the negotiating process, the scoreboard - that is, the set of indicators that have been negotiated - includes not only financial and nominal indicators, but also indicators from the real economy.
After this agreement was not honoured by the Sri Lankan Government, the UN Secretary-General appointed a panel of experts to advise him on modalities for an accountability process.
After we received the petition, the Commission asked the Austrian Government how it had ensured that the directive was properly applied in this project.
After what happened in Japan recently, it is crucial that stress tests be carried out on European nuclear plants to assess health standards and risks, avoid potential disasters and alleviate public concern.
After years of inaction, the Commission seems intent on acting, and that is necessary: the survival of our companies and jobs depends on it. Finally, I welcome the adoption of the amendments put forward by the Group of the Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament with regard to compliance, in the context of public procurement, with working, social and environmental standards in force in the Member States.
Again, I urge MEPs and the Commission to be realistic and to be cautious with the money we have and with which we should aim to bring maximum benefit to our constituents.
Again, as regards neighbours, we also expect Russia to adhere to the agreements in the treaties in respect of Georgia and to withdraw its troops back to those areas where they were present before the conflict.
Again, is it possible to have one currency and 17 governments, 17 economic strategies and 17 bond markets - as we have today and is a situation which does not exist elsewhere in the world? It is only us in Europe who think that we can have one monetary union and 17 different policies, 17 different governments and 17 different bond markets.
Against the background of the global economic crisis, the EU is experiencing a crisis of democracy and solidarity.
Against the background of the recent migratory pressure from North Africa, the strengthening of Frontex has become a high priority for the Council. I would like to express my thanks to Mr Busuttil and the shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation and I very much hope, as I have just emphasised, that a first-reading agreement can be achieved by June 2011, as was called for by the European Council in March.
Against this backdrop, it is important to increase the mobility of young people in the EU so that, where necessary, they will have more chance of finding work on another labour market.
Against this background, I am hoping for positive developments after two tough and difficult years.
Against this background, we believe that the key priorities for the next MFF should be grouped around the following themes: knowledge for growth and employment, sustainable development, cohesion for growth and employment, citizenship and Global Europe.
Agencies are also subject to evaluation by the Court of Auditors in connection with the annual discharge procedure, the results of which are discussed in the Committee on Budgetary Control.
Agencies were also advising companies on ways to present their higher-risk products as low risk, and this misleading practice meant that these products turned out to be more toxic than their rating would suggest and led to huge losses for investors, including pension holders across Wales.
Agenda of the next sitting : see Minutes
Agreement on a balanced, high-quality text is in sight. I just hope that the spirit of compromise that has brought us this far will carry us through to a final agreement.
Agreement on this requirement for Member States to provide data with harmonised methodology on environmental economy is actually a positive concrete step in the 'beyond GDP' process.
Agriculture provides security of supply of affordable, quality food; it provides essential protection for the environment and for balanced land use; and it creates jobs, growth and wealth.
Agriculture, after all, currently has its sprinklers wide open.
Ahead of the publication of the results, the Member States will need to release their strategies for possible restructuring or recapitalisation of their vulnerable institutions.
Aid, of course, is very important to Pakistan, but the idea of this trade package was to provide an incentive to entrepreneurs to start rebuilding factories and reinvesting in the textile and other industries that were literally swept away by the flooding.
Air agreements now fall within this category.
Air quality also has a significant impact on health expenditure, and particularly on expenditure on respiratory and oncology units.
Air services agreements now fall into this category, as they cover an area to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies.
Airlines will also benefit from the Agreement, since it provides for the use of each other's approved repair and maintenance facilities.
Albania and the FYROM have concluded a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU, and the development of a sustainable economy and green infrastructure, which will naturally lead to job creation at local level, will create a significant potential for employment, thereby contributing to the realisation of the Europe 2020 Strategy.
All European citizens have the right to know whether or not those nuclear power plants are actually safe.
All I can say is that we have this dialogue with the EBA, we are determined - Mr Giegold has drawn all the lessons from this new round of tests, just as we drew lessons from the previous round, which was unsatisfactory - and we have an ambition - Mr Sánchez Presedo asked me to show ambition - which is to be demanding and rigorous when holding this dialogue, while respecting the powers and the independence of the EBA, just as we in the Commission demand respect for our own independence.
All I would say is that our role is to listen to the growing worries - and the word is weak - in a number of States in relation to the reforms undertaken in the name of the Bologna process.
All Member States will hopefully have learned the lessons of the crisis, namely that a balanced budget and strong fiscal discipline are rewarded by lower funding costs in the financial markets, and that honesty in statistical reporting is essential for continued market confidence.
All children must be able to access education, regardless of social background, and we must ensure that this opportunity is also available to the children of asylum seekers, refugees and all those who have permission, even if only temporary, to reside within the Union.
All costs added to the value of the order shall be borne by the seller.
All executions, wherever they take place, should be condemned.
All in all, I am looking forward to discussions with the Council members, I am looking forward to the result of your voting and I am looking with confidence to the future, in the hope that one of the pillars we have talked about will be finalised before the end of the year.
All in all, Parliament is advocating a new 'made in' labelling regime, which is currently a Sleeping Beauty after the conclusion of the first reading in 2010.
All in all, the Hungarian Presidency is convinced that the enlargement of the Schengen area to include Bulgaria and Romania, now that they meet all the technical and legal criteria, would be beneficial for the entire Schengen cooperation and for Europe as a whole, where one could travel from the Black Sea to the Atlantic without being stopped to show a passport or identity card.
All in all, we are aware that not all wishes could be satisfied in the negotiations, but these positive aspects that we were able to achieve in the negotiations thanks to Parliament's strength should lead to the desired positive effects.
All international aid should be made dependent on democratic change in Belarus.
All of Europe is fighting against poverty.
All of our countries have been affected in different ways in the current crisis and we have different experiences. A single voice is not as strong as a multitude of voices singing in harmony.
All of these activities must be subject to strict controls in compliance with international standards.
All of these factors are reasons why I am voting in favour of this report.
All of these positions are worked out with the 27 Foreign Affairs Council ministers and I have to pay tribute to them. I think that we are moving inexorably to a greater sense of coherence.
All of this goes against Directive 2000/78/EC, which establishes a general framework for the fight against discrimination. I therefore ask the Commissioner what action she intends to take, in view of the fact that the fundamental rights in the new Hungarian constitution are hardly compatible with those of the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
All of this goes towards underlining the need to protect European businesses and the fact that there can be no growth and development, and above all no jobs, in a social and market economy situation in which the market - which is also a fundamental instrument of our European Union - does not pursue a higher and more important goal, namely social policy.
All of this is starting to look ridiculous on the world stage.
All of us - individual Members, political groups and institutions - have come a long way.
All of us take an oath, when we assume our duties, saying that we are not there to represent countries, and, in fact, the credibility of the institution comes exactly from that fact - that we try to be independent and to serve the general European interest. I can tell you that the Member States, including the UK, are very well represented in the European Council by their Prime Ministers and in the Council by the various ministers.
All our agencies need to be able to fulfil the tasks that we currently pile on them.
All over Europe, governments are imposing austerity budgets, and this House would be exceedingly unwise if it does not take on board that message, if it chooses to ignore the letter from the five Heads of Government, because what those five Heads of Government were saying is: more Europe is not the answer; smarter Europe is.
All parliamentarians take responsibility politically for their decisions and standpoints.
All that paints a much more complex picture than simply deciding whether this person or that person should preside over the future of the IMF.
All that will happen without the mandatory reallocation of sufficient resources to improve transport infrastructure and the efficiency and environmental performance of the haulage industry, something that should be an essential outcome of this directive.
All the 'made in x' label does is create a false sense of clarity for the consumer, while in reality bringing about extra costs and bureaucracy.
All the Members have had an opportunity to speak. I allowed them to speak for at least 15 seconds and even a minute in some cases, and the balance between the political groups has been fully respected.
All the abovementioned goals are of the utmost importance in terms of strengthening security in poorer regions.
All the authorities now need to quickly eliminate the prejudices against fresh vegetables, re-invigorate sales of fresh vegetables and breathe new life into trade with third countries.
All the information now provided by the Court of Auditors must be taken into consideration by the EU, particularly by the Commission as the main executive and management body of the EU budget.
All the investigators were given access to the airports at Otopeni, Bucharest and Constanţa, as well as to the base at the Torrejón Satellite Centre.
All the punishments are applied to those already in difficulty, even when these are the result of a euro overvalued against the dollar.
All the regions of Europe should play to their strengths. I will go in a couple of weeks' time to Debrecen, in Hungary, to the 'Week of innovative regions of Europe' conference, where all the regions will come together to talk about the concept of smart specialisation.
All the reservations which we have recently been hearing relate to the foreign policy debates of some Member States.
All the shortcomings identified in the past have been rectified.
All these areas will be improved by the creation of this European service. I voted for this resolution in order to put pressure on the European and national authorities and to prevent a delay that deprives Europe every day of infinite possibilities.
All these aspects are vital not only to the quality of life enjoyed by European citizens, but also to agriculture and rural development. I would like to stress that sustainable forest management is of pivotal importance to the European Union's achievement of its climate goals and to carbon dioxide capture from the atmosphere.
All these examples should certainly justify not a budget increase but a budget reduction. I would like to think that the UK Government will take a stand, will say enough is enough, and call for a reduction.
All these incidents raise serious question marks with us, especially as we must not forget that Azerbaijan has signed up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
All these issues should be included in the CAP after 2013 and should be taken into account when it is reformed. I also welcome the European Parliament's desire to help small farmers as well as young farmers, especially when they are starting up. Finally, it is important that the CAP guarantee farmers better incomes, the latter having dwindled steadily in recent decades and standing now at half the incomes of urban households.
All these major transformations are making the European Union commit itself actively, alongside the other partners, to promoting effective solutions to the problems affecting both European citizens and the whole of humanity.
All these steps have been taken as essential parts of Parliament's role.
All these young people must also find their future within the European Union's borders.
All this demands a lot of political will and some extra resources, and I will do my best to fight to make sure that there are resources under my responsibility.
All this is exacerbated by the key policies of the EU, particularly the Economic and Monetary Union, internal market competition and the liberalisation of international trade, among other issues.
All this must be combined with other forms of management that permit a fairer reward for the work carried out by professionals in this sector, a group of people who need to progress and continue learning throughout their working lives.
All this must be viewed from the sustainability standpoint you have been talking about, as well as from the environmental and social standpoints, but must also be viewed from the other side, which is also important: that is, the human side, for fishers who are suffering enormously.
All this requires direct participation on the part of local authorities and civil society, and the involvement of cities' political representatives in strategic planning and in defining and negotiating partnership contracts.
All this will help to strengthen consumer confidence and overcome the reluctance of businesses to engage in cross-border trade.
All this will serve not only to reduce defence expenditure but also to increase the autonomy of the European Union on the international scene. I believe that this point of view has been well captured in the report, which constitutes a step in the right direction in terms of promoting a common security and defence policy which is more effective, coordinated and consistent with the rest of the policies of the European Union and its Member States.
All those involved in cohesion policy agree that having several European funds in parallel - the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) - does not always allow the European Union's financial resources to be managed in an optimal way. I voted in favour of this report because it proposes interesting ways of achieving the imperative objective of increasing consistency between these devices. I have high hopes that this approach, which is supported by the European Commission, will form part of the Commission's upcoming proposals concerning the regulatory framework that will apply to future cohesion policy (2014-2020).
All those who are in the register should be sure that if there is something inappropriate we will find it, we will criticise it, try to correct it and we will not be afraid to shame those responsible.
All we ask is that on your next visit you bring a little sunshine to Brussels.
Allergy sufferers in particular stand to gain from this proposal, as fur is potentially hazardous to their health and without proper labelling, they may buy a product containing these textiles without realising it.
Allergy sufferers in particular stand to gain from this proposal, as fur is potentially hazardous to their health, and the Commission must also study the possibility that potentially hazardous materials and chemicals used in textiles may lead to allergic reactions.
Allocated a budget of around EUR 54 billion for the period 2007-2013, the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) has become one of the largest research support programmes in the world and represents the primary tool of EU research policy.
Allocating greater resources would mean, in the first place, investing in the trans-European transport networks (TEN-Ts), for which modernisation is an urgent priority; and, secondly, proceeding to reduce the physical, cultural, administrative and regulatory obstacles which hamper cooperation and territorial cohesion.
Allow me now to turn to the six legislative proposals on economic governance, called the 'six-pack' in our common jargon. I will not go into detail as it is on the plenary agenda in its own right.
Allow me to cite my own home country as an example: Austria has a school drop-out rate of just 8.7%, as compared to the EU average of around 14%, and it would certainly be worth examining Austria's dual system of vocational training, which is supported by the social partners.
Allow me to convey the appreciation of the Council to the European Parliament for the excellent cooperation. I would like to thank especially the rapporteur, Mr Toine Manders and his colleagues for the highly valuable work they have contributed to this process. I also appreciate the work of the Swedish, Spanish and Belgian Presidencies, because the current result is due to their work of superior quality.
Allow me to draw your attention to a few specific matters.
Allow me to make a suggestion: within the European External Action Service, we have created a department which deals specifically with humanitarian crises.
Allow me to make one point crystal clear: this is not about finding ways for Member States to reintroduce border controls. I firmly believe that to do so would not only catastrophically undermine what Europe has constructed over the past 61 years, but also sabotage the viability of our efforts to build a prosperous and integrated Europe for the future.
Allow me to remind you of the key EU institutions whose discharge reports were prepared by Mr Rivellini.
Allowing for annual evaluations of the state of stocks, these fishing opportunities can be revised upwards or downwards, entailing a consequent review of the amount of financial contribution due. EUR 682 500 will be paid annually as a financial contribution.
Allowing the sale of a higher percentage of tractors calibrated to the old, more permissive emission limits will actually serve to protect the economic interests of this strategic manufacturing sector, without altering the environmental protection objectives that have already been laid down.
Allowing them to follow the most suitable educational pathway, to make it easy for them to learn foreign languages, to approach the world of work equipped with the appropriate skills, or perhaps to enter a new educational or working environment, means building a future for all the countries of the European Union through the energies of university students and young workers, who come together in the same economic and cultural melting pot.
Allowing those countries to develop their markets could make a real difference, supporting not just the opening of markets but how they gain access to them, ensuring that they can reach our standards, and ensuring that they have real opportunities.
Almost the entire market for credit ratings, which are sometimes made compulsory for regulatory purposes, is controlled by three large US agencies.
Along these lines Prime Minister Orbán has recently said that we should clearly differentiate between economic migrants and political refugees.
Along with the speakers who came before me, however, I believe there is little desire on the part of Member States, in particular, to invest in controls and to introduce sufficiently harsh penalties for breaches of the existing rules.
Already in May 1941, as the President has said, the Soviet leadership had decided to cleanse Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia of anti-Soviet elements in political and economic elites.
Also among the negative aspects, Baroness Ashton, is the situation of Camp Ashraf: you are aware of the positive, constructive and moderating role that my group is playing in the development of foreign policy, and believe me when I say that the importance and sensitivity of the Iranian dossier has not escaped me.
Also as part of the legislative package aimed at reinforcing economic governance in the EU and the euro area, there has been a vote on this draft opinion on requirements for budgetary frameworks of the Member States. I voted for this report because I essentially share the rapporteur's concerns, particularly as regards amendments pertaining to the following key issues: 1) the general aim of this proposal should be linked to the promotion of a high level of employment, the guarantee of adequate social protection and the fight against social exclusion; 2) rules put forward to ensure improvements in national budgetary frameworks should be established in the context of the European Semester for policy coordination; 3) the requirements for national budgetary frameworks should not only ensure that Member States' fiscal planning is based on realistic forecasts, but should also ensure that appropriate attention is given to the sustainability of their respective social protection systems, including health care and pension systems; and, finally, 4) the requirements for national budgetary frameworks should also be designed in such a way as to encourage Member States to achieve the EU's growth and jobs objectives.
Also as part of the legislative package aimed at reinforcing the economic governance in the EU and the euro area, there has been a vote on this draft opinion on the effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area. I voted for this report because I essentially share the rapporteur's concerns, particularly as regards amendments pertaining to the following key issues: 1) the enforcement of budgetary surveillance should always be subject to requirements related to the promotion of a high level of employment; 2) the guarantee of adequate social protection and the fight against social exclusion; 3) enhanced budgetary surveillance through an enforcement system should be composed not only of fines - sanctions - but also incentives; 4) a strengthened role for the European Parliament, as well as that of national parliaments, throughout the entire surveillance process.
Also important is the EU multilateralism issue and the need to be always well represented in the different strategic contexts, taking advantage, in particular, of the new EEAS, the European diplomatic corps that has finally become a reality.
Also of interest is the idea of bringing the timing of the MMF into line with the political cycles of EU bodies, thereby increasing democratic control and accountability.
Also on the same day, 22 years ago, the first partly-free parliamentary elections took place in Central and Eastern Europe, in Poland, where candidates of the democratic opposition won, taking almost all the seats which were open to a free vote.
Also, can you tell us what initiatives you and the EU intend to take to ensure that the Israeli Government hands over the tax revenues owed to the Palestinian Authority?
Also, from a general point of view, the chapter on investment must respect both parties' right to legislate in areas such as the environment, public health, employee and consumer rights, industrial policy and cultural diversity, among others.
Also, if we increase the ceiling, only the bigger vessels will gain any advantage from it. I am surprised that some Members of Parliament - who I would not have expected to say this - are asking me to increase this ceiling.
Also, marriage and family values as defined there go beyond the reality of people living in Europe and in Hungary, and it is not the rule of diversity that we have.
Also, the post-EIA stage should merit closer attention: it is frequently neglected.
Although CRA ratings fulfil several useful purposes (for example, they aggregate information about the credit quality of issuers, which is particularly helpful in our global environment), developments in the regulatory framework have turned these 'information intermediaries' into de facto 'regulatory licensors', a mistake that we must not make!
Although Canada has a strong presence in international trade, and is one of the European Union's oldest trading partners, we must proceed very sensitively and constructively as we finalise the comprehensive economic and trade agreement between the European Union and Canada.
Although GDP is a strong macro-economic indicator, it does not reflect Lithuania's greatest social problems, such as unemployment, the quality of education and health care systems and disparities in income distribution.
Although GNSS will only have a military application, it will be the taxpayers who foot the bill - twice over now as a result of the follow-up costs.
Although I agree with some of the proposals made in the amendment, I do not support the establishment of a common rate of corporate taxation.
Although I am not entirely in favour of the resources released in this way being allocated to the Union's budget, as I think that the Millennium Development Goals should benefit, at least in part, I wished to vote for paragraph 171 to send a positive signal to the Commission and the Council regarding the implementation of this tax.
Although I am pleased to note that we are calling for values which we Europeans consider to be fundamental, I also admit that it was with a certain sadness that I endorsed this report. I am aware that we sometimes call for these fundamental values to be upheld in other parts of the world, but forget that they are also being violated in some of the European Union's Member States.
Although I believe that it is in our interest to improve trade cooperation with Japan, we must strive to make our cooperation correct, open, balanced and beneficial to both parties. I would therefore like to express my support for the European Commission in its pursuit of this objective.
Although I believe that there is still a lot to be done in terms of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and of consumer rights, this report is a first step in facilitating cross-border trade between SMEs.
Although I represent the Centre, Auvergne and Limousin regions, which do not have borders with other Member States of the European Union, I am convinced of the usefulness of cross-border cooperation - and, more generally, of territorial cooperation - for the development of Europe and for building bridges between people. I completely agree with the proposals brought forward by the rapporteur, my colleague Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, particularly when it comes to enhancing the role of the European Groupings for Territorial Cooperation (EGTCs) and the financing of this objective.
Although I support some paragraphs, such as the one regarding the reduction of the European Parliament to one seat, the report hopes that an actual European tax will be introduced to finance European Union activities.
Although I welcome the agreement that has been reached on the Eurovignette Directive, I am nonetheless far from being fully satisfied.
Although Parliament has taken steps to improve its budget and make savings, questions remain over some issues such as funding for prizes, which are currently paid for by the tax payer.
Although a majority in the committee voted for the Commission proposal to award Pakistan these exceptional preferences, in fact, the Committee on International Trade also voted for several amendments aimed at limiting the impact of these trade advantages awarded to Pakistan, including, inter alia, the adoption of a safeguard clause, in case imports from Pakistan increase too much because of the reduction or removal of trade tariffs.
Although an action plan on global navigation satellite systems might be considered strategic, to provide signals guaranteed for civilian use and to ensure that European industry at all levels has an opportunity to compete in its growing market share, there are many key points that have not been addressed.
Although both Japan and the European Union are mature economies, their trade cooperation has failed to exploit the opportunities presented by their economic clout.
Although child development involves a number of contributing factors, whether genetically based or from the external environment, it is particularly the effect of the parents and the immediate circle of people that forms the personality.
Although experts have been in agreement on this for quite some time, the message has only recently got through to the political sphere, after considerable time and effort.
Although gender equality is recognised as a precondition for the achievement of sustainable development and the Millennium Development Goals, climate change policy does not, in the view of the experts, pay sufficient attention to this.
Although greater predictability in relation to FDI opportunities for EU investors is something to be welcomed, the potential negative aspects of investment policy, for example, the fear among the local population of redundancies and wage cuts due to outsourcing and the relocation of production, should not be swept under the carpet.
Although gross domestic product (GDP) is a measurement of production that is useful for economic market activity, it does not take into account the sustainability of the development demonstrated, or environmental and social aspects, etc. I therefore welcome the 'GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world' initiative, which aims to encourage and raise awareness of the use of other complementary GDP indicators when evaluating and discussing politics. I believe this system of measurement based on corroborating various study parameters will lead to political decisions more suited to the needs of society and the economy in general.
Although it acknowledges the importance and necessity of our having independent statistics authorities able to produce reliable and credible data on a Member State's macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts, I voted against this report because the punitive thinking behind it slots perfectly into a wider package to which I am opposed, for the reasons already expressed in the reports on this economic coordination.
Although it has been officially prohibited since 1986, an estimated 60 million children still work today in India's fields and factories.
Although it is expected that South Sudan will apply for accession to the Cotonou Agreement, the 10th European Development Fund will not be available until sometime after accession to the agreement.
Although it is mentioned in several places that the interests of broadcasting are to be taken into consideration, the Committee on Culture and Education would have liked there to have been much clearer wording in this regard.
Although it may seem strange to talk about culture, which is a non-essential good, when many Europeans are faced daily with problems obtaining goods essential to their survival, we cannot neglect it: instead, we must think that, in addition to being fundamental to our quality of life, it can and must be an opportunity for economic development and creating jobs for young people, as well as being, obviously, a factor of unity and cohesion between peoples.
Although it mentions that the radio spectrum is 'a key public resource for essential sectors and services', the report points the way towards the 'possibility to trade spectrum rights' and invites the Commission to adopt measures 'to ensure that Member States allow trading within the Union of spectrum usage rights'; once again, we do not agree with these guidelines and we would distance ourselves from them.
Although it relates to chemical and physical factors which, at first glance, are of little use in communication between politicians and voters, this indicator is, in fact, the result of numerous economic decisions: it indicates the concentration of polluting economic activities, the composition of the energy mix used for productive activities and for heating homes and offices, the use of motor vehicles and the management of road infrastructure and traffic, the insulation of buildings and the quality of the materials used, and the existence or otherwise of green spaces, to cite just a few examples.
Although many new roads have been built or repaired and Internet connections have been installed, there are still a great many needs to be met, since there is a very large gap between these regions and the most highly developed regions.
Although my outrage at, and condemnation of, all terrorist attacks and of fundamentalist terrorism remains absolute, I believe it is necessary to call for the abandonment of the death penalty in all cases and in all circumstances. I say this because we are opposed to every violation of fundamental human rights, always and wherever they occur.
Although no evidence was found for the shipments, what was clear from the outcome of my enquiries was that we could benefit from more regular inspections of cargo, as this would act as a deterrent to those involved in the illegal shipment of waste.
Although not all domestic workers are low-skilled and do not all work in precarious conditions, they are a vulnerable category and the Commission encourages the Member States to ensure they are properly protected by developing and enforcing their labour rights.
Although not all the compromises tabled and adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy are as balanced as I personally would have liked, I support very sincerely the general move to develop a spectrum management approach that is more integrated, realistic and responsive to the social, cultural and economic needs of our fellow citizens.
Although prevention is better than cure, we will also be better placed to take action to correct these situations if they do emerge.
Although repealing these regulations might appear to be a positive and welcome step from the standpoint of legislative simplification, it would, on the other hand, mean depriving our textile industry of still valid forms of defence against unfair competition from countries like China.
Although social protection falls under the competence of the Member States, the lack of harmonisation is clearly damaging the Internal Market.
Although some issues remain unresolved, such as the negative impact on biodiversity of tar sands extraction and of some seal-derived products, I voted in favour not only because the public procurement problem has practically been resolved, but also because of the benefits to the Member States, and to prevent the negotiations from suffering any delays.
Although some of the manufacturers of products opposed this initiative, referring to existing laws on the requirements for labelling parts of animal origin, an improvement has now been made, and it is a very real indication of the EU's consumer oriented thinking.
Although some problems remain unresolved, Romania and Bulgaria have proved to be sufficiently prepared to apply all the requirements of the Schengen acquis.
Although the Charter of Fundamental Rights may only be binding on European legislation and its implementation, Articles 2, 6 and 7 of the Treaties are binding on all Member States. A two-thirds majority was cemented into the Hungarian constitution, so that, realistically speaking, any future Hungarian Government will be unable to amend any of the country's laws.
Although the Deß report includes weaker elements of some of these proposals, unlike the Commission communication, it does not undermine the pro-market direction of travel of previous reforms.
Although the EU has set ambitious targets in its emblematic initiative entitled 'Digital Agenda', such as broadband cover for all EU citizens by 2013, with speeds of 30 Mbps or more by 2020, it is still lagging behind the USA and Japan in terms of competitiveness.
Although the EU is formally barred from participating because it is the Member States that are members, it is aware of its responsibilities to cooperate with the ILO and did not therefore want to fail to contribute to an area that we could say comes under the heading 'fundamental rights'. The importance of domestic work is indisputable.
Although the European Medicines Agency Management Board eventually decided to set limits with regard to the former Executive Director's new and future professional activities, the discharge authority needs further explanations from the Agency on how cases of conflict of interest are actually handled.
Although the European youth unemployment figures are extremely worrying - in January 2011, the unemployment rate among under-25s in the EU rose to 20.6% - the report on the 2020 strategy's flagship initiative, 'Youth on the Move', calls on Member States to increase their investment in education, training and mobility.
Although the Lisbon strategy and the Europe 2020 initiative place a far greater emphasis on social policy than was ever the case before, competitiveness and economic factors are still the centre of attention. I therefore took a very critical approach to the drafting of this report.
Although the Lisbon strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy place unprecedented emphasis on social policy, competitiveness issues and economic factors continue to take priority over social issues.
Although the Lisbon strategy gave - and the EU 2020 gives - to social policy an emphasis that is greater than ever before, the issues of competitiveness and economic factors continue to take priority over social issues.
Although the Vice-President/High Representative has made excellent senior appointments - I have seen some of these before the Committee on Foreign Affairs - I must ask why she has been short-changed in a stitch-up by the Commission, which seems to have retained a disproportionate amount of resources for EU enlargement and the European Neighbourhood Policy.
Although the agencies may not have triggered the global financial crisis, such actions on their part have, nonetheless, exacerbated it. In fact, they encourage speculation, jeopardising the chances of success of the already draconian recovery plans imposed on their people.
Although the conciliation procedure has come to an end, the needs and expectations of European consumers have not altered at all, and therefore I am pleased to note that we have another chance to make progress.
Although the decision establishing a Community action for the European Capital of Culture 2007-2019 only currently covers EU Member States, the truth is that the opportunity to win the title of European Capital of Culture has already been granted to cities of third countries on a number of occasions.
Although the decision on the European Capital of Culture for the years 2007 to 2019 applies only to the EU Member States, I agree with the resolution's call to award the title of European Capital of Culture exceptionally to Sarajevo in 2014. I believe that this would be an important step towards transcending past European divisions by awarding the title of European Capital of Culture to a city which was the scene of such tragic events in the course of the 20th century.
Although the directive should not allow discrimination based on the haulier's nationality, Article 7k permits Member States which introduce a system for charging tolls and/or users of the infrastructure to offer suitable compensation for these charges, which may distort competition.
Although the directive will apply to all vehicles over 3.5 tonnes, I think that this provision goes too far, because such vehicles mainly operate regionally, and this should not be regulated at European level.
Although the idea of a safety net is attractive, it is not enough.
Although the most extreme poverty has not disappeared, it is no less true that surges and flows of prosperity have raised India to a more prominent international role, and have revealed that its economy and society are prospering and innovating quickly and efficiently.
Although the price has fallen slightly, it continues to fluctuate, and for two years now, this situation has been affecting the daily lives of all our European fishermen, in particular, in the small-scale and coastal fishing sector.
Although the proposal initially only covers Member States whose currency is the euro, the European Parliament is seeking its application to any Member State that has notified the Commission that it wishes to apply this regulation, even if it is not a member of the euro area.
Although the relationship forged between the economies of individual Member States, and between them and the Union, needs to be reviewed, particularly in the light of what has happened in Greece and of the fact that various other Member States are showing signs of an imminent financial crisis on the same scale as that in Greece, such a review cannot be carried out using the methods presented in this report.
Although the report is a step in the right direction, there is still more that needs to be done. I hope that this register - if it proves to be a success - will develop into a mandatory register of lobbyists. I agree with Mr Duff's proposal that rapporteurs should name the lobbyists that they have had contact with when drafting a law.
Although the report is ambitious in seeking to find the greatest possible majority support from the House, I believe it lacks ambition in the objectives and aims it seeks to achieve in its current form.
Although the role of the Commission is strengthened, the report should clearly support the reversed qualified majority voting as planned in the first place to ensure independent and fast procedure of applying needed measures. I welcome in overall the call for greater transparency and involvement of European Parliament and national parliaments.
Although the vote on appointing certain European oligarchs is, according to regulation, a secret ballot, I am keen to let it be known that I voted against Mr Draghi,. because there is really something deeply unhealthy and perverse, in the middle of the sovereign debt crisis, about appointing a former European director of Goldman Sachs.
Although there are no foregone conclusions as to when the economic crisis will abate, the targets set by the Member States for 2020 in the research sector will not be achieved as things currently stand, just as the targets set in the previous European strategy, the Lisbon strategy, were not achieved.
Although there are some positive references to general principles of 'humanising work' and promoting creativity and the need for accessible pathways from informal to formal learning, they are all stale dead letter which simply embellish a report which, in the final analysis, promotes neoliberalism in every procedure and at every stage of education and training, even at the highest level.
Although there may well be disagreement between us as to whether those criteria have been met, much has been done.
Although these businesses are not involved in door-to-door selling, they naturally make frequent deals with customers that are concluded with a handshake.
Although they are in no way a substitute for political discussion or the democratic and legitimate decision-making process followed by law makers, and serve only to prepare the ground for political decisions, they draw the attention of law makers to the potential effects of their policies from the perspective of specialised content and help them to take decisions.
Although this agenda is within the exclusive competence of Member States, it is more than desirable for the Union, through its coordinating role, to contribute towards improving the situation in the Member States.
Although this report has some positive aspects, it was not capable of proposing the creation of a public, independent European Credit Rating Foundation.
Although we already have a large number of official bodies, he is obviously thinking of a way to strengthen the control of the Member States' authorities in this area. I would like to know how things stand in this area, because at present it would seem that we are unable to resolve this problem.
Although we are grateful for your contribution Mr Barnier, you have not explained why the risks associated with government bonds are recorded in the trading book, but not in the banking book.
Although we are now thinking about and debating the next multiannual framework, it was important to reiterate the fact that cohesion policy remains an essential lever for growth and that the budget earmarked for it should not be reduced.
Although we do now have earmarking to a very limited extent - 15% of infrastructure costs and 15% of external costs must go to the TEN-T networks - it is really far too little.
Although we have different opinions about energy production, we all agree, based on the 'polluter pays' principle, that the waste produced in the European Union has to be stored within the EU, even if reprocessing takes place in a third country.
Although we maintain our critical position regarding the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), since we believe it would have been more important to have taken measures to prevent the unemployment in the first place, we voted in favour of the mobilisation of this fund in order to provide further assistance for workers affected by the consequences of companies restructuring or of the liberalisation of international trade.
Although we support this mobilisation, as it is essential to support these workers, we would like to reiterate our reservations and critical position on this fund, as we believe that it would have been more important to have taken measures to prevent unemployment in the first place.
Although yet more detailed rules may be laid down in future, the text that has been adopted represents a positive compromise in the harmonisation of existing regulations, guaranteeing secure purchases and putting a definitive end to typical sharp practices that hide behind electronic purchasing.
Although, as the rapporteur mentions, Croatia's entry into the EU is envisaged for the second half of 2012 or early 2013, its participation in the EMCDDA could be accepted given that this country is making an effort to investigate and prosecute drug-related crime.
Although, at the moment, no precise figures are yet available on the extent of the losses in the European market-gardening sector following the E coli crisis, the economic damage caused to this sector will clearly not be negligible.
Although, from 2005-2009 in the EU, tests for monitoring the residues of antibacterial agents in animals and animal foodstuffs show positive results, we can still say that there is no controlled trend towards reduction, only fragmented fluctuations.
Although, undoubtedly, the crisis of the banking system contributed considerably to our current economic problems, it would be a mistake to conceal that most of the problems arose prior to the crisis from a lack of fiscal discipline in numerous countries, from economic policy that did not strengthen competitiveness, and from the absence of coordination in European economic policy.
Amendment of Rule 51: joint committee meetings (
Amnesty International and Médecins sans Frontières have also expressed extreme concern over the safety of those involved and indeed the motivation behind their arrests. I fully support the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and the International Council of Nurses, and indeed a number of Irish doctors, who are adding their voices in condemnation of these awful events.
Among other aspects, they can make them safer, more environmentally friendly and more economical.
Among other aspects, this will be achieved through progressive approximation of both parties' sets of requirements and regulatory processes.
Among other examples, we propose keeping the system of milk production quotas as an essential condition for protecting producers in particularly sensitive countries; we advocate maintaining planting rights in the wine sector and maintaining aid for the distillation of potable alcohol and emergency distillation; and we propose setting up a public agricultural insurance scheme, financed from EU funds, to guarantee a minimum income for farmers in the event of natural disasters.
Among other issues, let me inform you that the European Council is expected to appoint Mario Draghi as the next Governor of the European Central Bank on whom this house takes a vote.
Among other possible sources of financing, the report also proposes considering the possibility of paying companies for ecosystem services, through which they contribute to biodiversity conservation and forest protection.
Among other serious aspects, this regulation intends to give the Commission the power to withdraw authorisations, to ask Member States to negotiate or reject bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and to approve new BITs.
Among other things, I very much welcome the demand for Member States to secure sufficient funding for expenditure associated with the management of spent fuel. I myself have visited several radioactive waste storage facilities, and I firmly believe that a shortage of funding might directly lead to them becoming less safe, which is something we must prevent in Europe.
Among other things, it is foreign debt or excessive external imbalances on which markets have focused, and this clearly means that in responding to the situation, we must go beyond fiscal adjustment.
Among other things, the Court drew attention to carryovers and cancellations of significant budget appropriations: for example 38% of the budget under the title 'Buildings, Equipment and Miscellaneous Operating Expenditure' was carried over to 2010. EUR 14.8 million of this carryover was for activities as yet not implemented (or, in some cases, for goods not received) at the year-end, which is at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality.
Among other things, the adopted text establishes that the EP takes note of the budgetary constraints many Member States face as a result of the financial and economic crisis and the need to critically review potential savings at all levels including at Union level; and, in light of this situation, stresses that real savings could be achieved if Parliament only had one workplace in the same location.
Among other things, this text establishes that Parliament notes that the EU's mechanisms for building consensus and taking concerted action make it a model for a rules-based international order.
Among other things, we propose strengthening cooperation between the cultural and creative sectors and European universities, increasing the number of specialist training courses for young people, and improving the mobility of all creators and people of culture.
Among the amendments and innovations I opposed was an amendment to create an informal and powerless monitoring group in the European Parliament to scrutinise programmes.
Among the conclusions to draw from it, it should be stressed that the running costs of these programmes are estimated to be some EUR 800 million per annum and that revenue will only reach EUR 80 million per annum by around 2030.
Among the intended cost-saving measures, it has been decided that an interpretation service will automatically be provided for meetings of working groups in six languages only (French, German, English, Polish, Spanish and Italian), whilst other languages will only be made available if Members request them.
Among the main advances, I would like to mention two: the cooling-off period, which has been extended to 14 days, and provision of the summary containing all the information and the total price to pay before the last button or click which confirms the order.
Among the many others, the most important point is the budget, which is undoubtedly the only and most important tool for constructing the delicate balance between consolidation of the public accounts and the need to support growth.
Among the negative aspects, and despite the efforts of Baroness Ashton, is the different yardsticks against which the cases of Libya and Syria are measured in the United Nations Security Council and also in the Council of Ministers of the European Union.
Among them is Hungary, currently holding the Presidency.
Amongst other uses, they are fed to animals on a preventative basis.
Amongst the most important aspects, we would stress: the need for a comprehensive and detailed evaluation of the reasons for the inadequate achievement of the objectives regarding development cooperation and the various lines of support for the fisheries sector in Mauritania; the advocating of support for the fastest possible construction of adequate facilities for landing fish along Mauritania's central and southern coastlines, including Nouakchott, so that fish caught in Mauritanian waters can be landed at national ports rather than outside the country, as is often the case at present; and that fisheries agreements between the EU and third countries should be preceded by a wide-ranging debate in the countries concerned, allowing participation by the public, civil society organisations and national parliaments, thereby promoting greater democracy and transparency.
An absolutely key element is the fact that young people must have the opportunity, not only in their studies, but also in their vocational training, to undertake part of their training in another EU Member State.
An additional fine for Member States falsifying their fiscal statistics is also provided for, at the initiative of the Parliament.
An agency's strategy is usually set by the director in agreement with the governing board, and these strategies are presented to Parliament each year and are reflected in the annual work programme.
An agenda must be established for sharing research, knowledge and best practices. I support the request that further research be done on animal welfare and agricultural practices, such as improving herd management, early prevention of disease and the breeding of robust varieties of animals.
An agreement could lead to relations between the two areas reaching even greater levels of economic cooperation, creating even stronger links between these two areas, which are already profoundly linked by a common cultural approach.
An agreement signed between these organisations well over 50 years ago implies that the Agency can prevent the WHO from having access to information regarded as confidential, even if this information may be crucially important for monitoring and understanding the effects of nuclear accidents on human health.
An agreement such as this must also contain elements that do not necessarily relate only to trade - these have also been mentioned already: sustainability, human rights, social, environmental and labour standards - these things are also unbelievably important.
An announcement today in that direction would certainly be helpful for Egypt and for the Egyptians.
An attempt has been made at a higher level to introduce comprehensive multinational regulations for Foreign Direct Investment, or FDI, that would apply to all economic sectors.
An attempt has been made at both WTO and OECD level to introduce comprehensive multinational regulations for foreign direct investment, or FDI, that would apply to all economic sectors.
An education with a robust, quality foundation guarantees Europeans a better future.
An emphasis on increasing efficiency, instead of on limiting consumption, will result in technological innovations being prioritised, which will be to our advantage.
An energetic, growing cultural sector is clearly necessary for Europe's success as a creative, knowledge-based economy.
An equally incontrovertible fact is that this was a mistake and we are paying the consequences.
An examination of the proposal for a Council directive codifying Council Directive 92/79/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on cigarettes, Council Directive 92/80/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes, and Council Directive 95/59/EC of 27 November 1995 on taxes other than turnover taxes which affect the consumption of manufactured tobacco, resulted in the Consultative Working Party's concluding, without dissent, that the proposal is a straightforward codification of existing texts, without any change in their substance.
An example of this is Latin America and its notorious underfunding.
An excellent example of partnership, support and exchange of experience which has yielded positive results is the cooperation between Polish regions and the countries in the Eastern Partnership over the last few years.
An idea is being promoted for structural or agricultural funds for financing innovation and research. I think that this notion is neither feasible nor fair. A realistic solution is to create specific instruments which will be earmarked only for research and innovation.
An important objective of cohesion policy is European cross-border cooperation.
An important point in the report is the request for the introduction of one or several genuine own resources to replace the present GNI-based system and to achieve an autonomous, fairer, more transparent, simple and equitable financing system.
An important way of regaining this trust is being open about what we do and what influences shape our work.
An in-depth assessment of European environmental economic accounts can only be made on the basis of reliable data and therefore, Member States should be equipped with common methodology and standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules which should be developed in a framework which is binding on all States. I am voting in favour of the proposal because the objectives to be pursued and the future direction to be taken regarding environmental economic accounts need to be clearly set out, and so that these accounts can constitute an indispensable basis for environmental economic decision making.
An informal trialogue resolved the issue to permit adoption at first reading.
An innovation policy that is consistent and integrated, and has a long-term vision will enable us to leverage strengths and resolve weaknesses detected at regional level.
An institutional agreement was reached between Parliament and the Commission with the aim of setting up a common register.
An uncertain entrepreneurial environment and an unfavourable legislative framework can dampen citizens' creative spirit.
And I am happy that the rapporteur has made the proposal for a research voucher, trying to secure that we have a spontaneous process for excellence between researchers in Europe by creating and increasing their mobility.
And I ask her for less arrogance and more diligence.
And allow me one more comment: if anyone were to deny one of our most basic freedom rights from the weakest, then these rights would be in jeopardy for all of us.
And every year it is the same finding: waste, shortcomings in recruitment and public procurement procedures, carryovers and cancellations of too numerous appropriations ... It is not necessary to uncover fraud, as at the European Economic and Social Committee, to reach a verdict of mismanagement.
And finally, Commissioner, protection against cyber attacks and terrorist attacks has to be established in all sectoral policies of the European Union where cross-border emission of hazardous materials may occur.
And finally, a comment: I think it was Mr Weber of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) who said that we had to be very careful about the policy we implement concerning migrants, European problems and labour supply. I deeply agree with that.
And finally, allow me to congratulate Mr Coelho who prepared the report, whose constructive and consistent work has been truly important in this matter. I would also like to thank the Hungarian Presidency for its commitment and the concrete steps it took to facilitate the accession of the two Member States as soon as possible.
And finally, since the ongoing evaluation of the Schengen system has been discussed at length as well, I would like to say that the Hungarian Presidency has already stated this very clearly from the first moment, and this is something we continue to believe in. The issue of the Schengen expansion must be clearly separated from the type of evaluation to which we will subject the Schengen system.
And how better to achieve that than to enable citizens from the world over to be represented at the UN? There is the European Parliament, but there are also regional parliaments, such as the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
And indeed it is vital to maintain and improve Europe's economic and competitive position and to maximise its social and cultural impact by enabling innovative services for the benefit of citizens.
And it is also clear from the draft Memorandum of Understanding we have submitted that we also have to clarify what data provision falls within the competence of the Council and what does not. I think this will promote presentation between the various administrations.
And lastly, I find it important to mention the importance of a deep understanding of cultural heritage, so that communities living together can recognise and respect each other's cultural values. I believe that the concrete task of the Commission is to promote all of these issues, while that of Parliament is to strengthen theoretical and political support.
And let me reiterate, not for the first time in this House, that our basic philosophy is a strong Europe; a strong Europe that places people at the centre of its thinking.
And my question to Mr Vigenin, as the Socialist Group has links to Yanukovych's Party of the Regions, is: do you have confidence in the political impartiality of the General Prosecutor's Office in Ukraine? Mr Vigenin, could you answer that?
And now not just us, but everybody from the liberals to the PPE demand an explanation for the failure.
And please, Commissioner Rehn, do not tell me that these policies I am denouncing are being pursued by socialist governments.
And the nation that plays it is lost!'
And they are right in doing so. We have a common responsibility and therefore our success or failure is shared.
And this Parliament's approach on that issue is not supported by many of my group's members. I cannot support Parliament's changes to the Council text on the macroeconomic imbalances and I would like to see in the weeks ahead more clarity on the different positions between euro zone and non-euro-zone Member States.
And this is what this Parliament is already demanding of lobbyists coming here to us. I hope that the other institutions will follow suit.
And what are we talking about and promising Egypt? One billion.
And when the Germans accepted, they then said that Italy was chairing the European Union for these six months, so they had to be there.
And why? Because they will be elected by angry German taxpayers and by desperate French and Dutch private entrepreneurs fed up of paying other people's debts, and I know that neither you nor I want this to happen.
And yet I am voting in favour of it. I want to validate the notion of necessary statistical instruments even if I reject the policies that they may serve.
And yet this reform had been consigned to oblivion before the Belgian Presidency put it back on the Council's table. I welcome the progress made as a positive first step towards a more sustainable road transport system.
And, as Members of this House I am sure will privately be able to let them know, that is not an unmixed blessing.
And, of course, across Africa, I mentioned two countries, but we could talk about many more, not least as regards what is happening again today in Sudan and the importance of ensuring that South Sudan is created with the best possible chances of success
And, particularly, I think that some have said that this is a transfer of powers from Member States to the European Union.
Annual growth rates of the market for GNSS-enabled products and services are estimated to be above 10%. The Commission should launch a comprehensive analysis to identify more precisely the possible scenarios and means of operation and exploitation post 2013.
Annual report from the Council to Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) in 2009 (
Another aspect concerns the instruments and schemes at EU level supporting the forestry sector, which are very lightweight compared with those applied in other business sectors and given the current and future contribution made by forests to achieving the sustainable development targets.
Another aspect is to encourage study grants offered to students by private companies.
Another big sticking point in the negotiations was the Council's failure to act on the import of embryos and semen into the EU, which allows farmers to breed offspring of clones.
Another boost will come following the wonderful achievement of Swansea City Football Club - and I say this for the benefit of my colleague Richard Howitt - who have just deservedly reached the Premier Football League after a fantastic season. I pay tribute to the manager, players, directors, staff and fans who have made promotion possible.
Another cause for concern is the suspicion that antibiotic resistance is being transferred directly via foodstuffs.
Another cause for satisfaction is that, with this report by Mr El Khadraoui - and I congratulate him on his tenacity - we are clearly expressing our desire to see the 'polluter pays' principle factored into the costs of road transport.
Another commitment was to set up traceability systems for reproductive material originating from cloned animals outside the EU. These commitments were made on several occasions and must feature in the new proposals. I am confident that Member States will focus greater attention on the legitimate concerns of the European Union's citizens.
Another crucial point in the report is the endorsement of a decisive reduction in red tape for farmers and national authorities, in order to simplify the numerous administrative obligations in the sector.
Another factor which is also just as important is for traders not to have to adapt to different requirements.
Another idea that has mileage in it is to gradually abandon subsidies that are harmful to the environment, along the lines of what the Commission has done for tobacco. I am also pleased that the European Parliament has reaffirmed its support for own resources because it is only right that the Union should manage its own budget.
Another important aspect to bear in mind is the dialogue on the further liberalisation of the visa system, in view of the commitment to abolish these in the long run for travel between the EU and Russia.
Another important element is the strengthening of development based on small and medium-sized enterprises.
Another important point in this report is that it supports the creation of a system of funding the European budget that is transparent, simpler and more equitable.
Another important provision of the directive is the one which concerns the way in which income from tolls is spent.
Another issue again involving just a nuance: while the compensation of migration costs by Member States is a very important issue - no doubt about that - it must be in conformity with State aid rules. I think there is no difference between our points of view; it is something that has to be mentioned.
Another issue that we absolutely must address is how we are to finance the EU budget, and in this regard, our group has been very clear.
Another item on the upcoming European Council agenda is the Commission's recommendation that Croatia become the 28th Member State of the European Union, hopefully by 1 July 2013.
Another key point, of course, is public health and safety, and I am pleased that the planned stress tests, both in the EU and, as has been said here, also in Belarus, and in the future Ukraine and Russia, should be such as to make people in the EU safe.
Another measure needed is for India to produce and implement some transparent, clear regulations on public procurement, which will also enable European companies to gain access to them.
Another nuanced issue: while I understand the addition of the need to ensure sufficient spectrum for audiovisual services, that should not single out specific modes of delivery.
Another point that we consider significant relates to rural development and to the harnessing of all natural and human potential through quality agricultural production and the protection of mountain areas.
Another point which I am opposed to is the implication that woody biomass is not sustainable. I believe that we should highlight the variety of protective and useful functions provided by the forests and not take a one-sided approach.
Another problem we have here is the fact that we cannot even use the reasoning of providing maximum protection for investments.
Another question that has been repeatedly touched upon is child labour. I think it is fair to make a distinction between child labour in manufacturing and child labour in agriculture.
Another report that seems very important to me is Youth on the Move, one of the main aims of which is to address early school leaving. I believe that this issue is absolutely connected to youth unemployment, with the very high percentage of unemployment that we have in our Union.
Another strength brought to light by this report is the establishment of European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation (EGTCs). I believe that the establishment of these groupings can bring about positive results both from the point of view of governance, in that they would signify cross-border governance that guarantees authorship of different policies at local and regional levels, and from that of social cohesion, as it creates more potential for communities that are linguistically and culturally different from each other to come closer together.
Another very important question is the matter of energy sources and the costs which will be borne by EU Member States when paying Russia for them. A resolution to the question of the ban on imports of vegetables from the EU to the Russian market is urgent.
Another very important subject is the EU's multilateralism, which benefits, above all, from the recent establishment of the European External Action Service, which has at last come into being.
Another, simpler, daily example is that of fires. A fire which destroys a forest and the biodiversity and eco-systemic services provided by the forest, by which I mean clean water, clear air and the framework for reproducing food, which destroys the cultural heritage of a place, which destroys agricultural production, is measured positively in terms of GDP, because investments are made to restore the damage, despite the fact that the country, the region, the area, will have sustained long-term damage.
Antibiotic resistance in livestock and domestic animals has become a problem in recent years.
Antibiotics are costly and therefore, farmers do not just use them as they would give an animal a drink of water.
Antibiotics must not be demonised, but used with caution in both people and animals.
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an animal health issue for the European livestock sector, covering dairy, beef, pig and poultry meat, eggs, and sheep and goat milk and meat production.
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an animal health issue for the European livestock sector, covering dairy, beef, pig and poultry meat, eggs, sheep and goat milk and meat production.
Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an animal health issue for the European livestock sector, especially at a time when guidelines on the prudent use of antimicrobials have already been issued in several Member States, which has led to a reduction in the usage of these substances.
Any Member State leaving the euro - which is what Mrs Le Pen wants for France - would see its new currency dramatically devalued.
Any additional charges on Irish hauliers would have a major negative impact on our exports. I think I am supported by the Spanish, the Portuguese and also the Italians.
Any change to the own resources system also requires all Member States to give their approval in order for it to enter into force.
Any debate on the Schengen Agreement must, in my opinion, be accompanied by amendments to Dublin II.
Any decision leading to the administration of antimicrobials, whether to humans or animals, should be carefully considered and take into account the potential threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In fact, this resistance affects both humans and animals, and can be transmitted from human to animal and vice versa. I am well aware that AMR in humans is often caused by inadequate doses of antibiotic medicines and incorrect treatments, but it can also be through the transmission, via animals, of pathogenic bacteria carrying AMR genes, with serious consequences for public and animal health.
Any free trade agreement the EU signs with India must in no way limit India's ability to produce generic medicines.
Any hidden agenda has the potential to distort, if not destroy, these relations.
Any new EU rules on charging heavy goods vehicles must maintain a balance between the environmental needs and economic interests of the new Member States.
Any reform made to the approach of European Union policies to forests must not simply be reduced to the challenges posed by climate change, but take into account all the aspects relating to forests' contribution to sustainable development at regional, European and global level.
Any threats that could cost the nuclear industry too dearly, such as human error or plane crashes, are simply ignored, despite the fact that these are key when assessing the safety of the population.
Any weakening of Member States' ambition to complete the reforms which have been initiated under the strain of the crisis, excessive indulgence, too many exceptions to the commonly accepted rules and a return to a new round of internal protectionism will deal fatal blows.
Anyone seeking to freeze the budget will damage Europe and weaken our ability to fulfil our duties to our citizens.
Anyone who does not want to see things in those terms just has to look at how the budget is being implemented this year and the major problems that are being experienced with finding sufficient payments, even to put into action the solidarity instrument, for example, which benefits some needy regions of Europe.
Anyone who enjoys skiing, as I do, will know that at around 15:00 in the afternoon in this region, noise pollution seems to be a bigger problem than damage to the natural environment.
Anyone who followed with horror the events that made victims of the inhabitants of the martyr city of Sarajevo during the war in Bosnia, and which damaged its buildings, cannot fail to welcome the city's designation as European Capital of Culture 2014.
Anyone who knows a bit about Canada, has visited British Columbia and knows how international corporations have used their influence here to make the indigenous peoples give up their ancestral areas and allow these areas to be bought up, cannot simply ignore this.
Anyone who thinks that we are introducing a permanent subsidy category is underestimating the European Parliament.
Anyone who turns the constitutional right of an accused person to access their files into the exact opposite, in other words, into a compulsion to access the files, and anyone who does this, as in the case of Mr Lutsenko, by means of imprisonment and, in the case of Mrs Tymoshenko, by a total of 44 summonses so far, clearly demonstrates what sort of person he is and the fact that he is abusing the judicial system in the old-fashioned way for the purposes of political disputes.
Anyone who wants pluralism and political competition should ensure that the election standards declared by the Council of Europe are adhered to and should allow long-term election observation by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) at the earliest stage.
Anyway, it is a matter for the Committee on Regional Development to prepare the matter for debate in plenary. I am very surprised by your extremely optimistic view that our work is complete.
Apart from discussion in the framework of the EU-Russia summits, we should ensure that the consultations which take place twice yearly with European Union representatives and diplomats from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs are decisively stepped up.
Apart from having a standard EU-level policy, it is particularly important to ensure good collaboration and coordination locally between the various institutions and ministries involved in youth education programmes.
Apart from that, Japan is the seventh destination for European exports.
Apart from the objections that can be made to this approach on principle, I cannot understand how anyone can think that the EU can ever speak with one voice on such sensitive subjects, in which the interests of the individual Member States are very often different, if not quite openly conflicting.
Apart from the specific measures intended to address this particular situation, the Council remains fully committed to the further development of the common European asylum system.
Apart from the threat of accident or terrorist attack, there is also considerable evidence of adverse health effects along Ireland's eastern seaboard attributed to Sellafield discharges.
Apart from this, harmonisation of contract law would not prevent the discrepancies in other areas influencing transnational trade within the EU. There is no categorical proof indicating that it is these legal differences which are preventing transactions from being completed with foreign companies and consumers.
Apart from this, many studies have already shown that funding used in this way brings considerable economic and social advantages in the medium and long-term.
Apparently it was a Maltese vessel. I would therefore like to know: what boat was it and what information is available? Who failed to rescue the 600 Libyan refugees? In the 21st century, surely no one is going to tell me that it is not possible to identify the ship in question.
Apparently there are hundreds of expert groups who work on the official papers published by the Commission, however the identity of the members of these advisory bodies that meet behind closed doors remains a closely-guarded secret.
Applying double standards and talking about mandatory criteria which, once they have been met, are regarded as 'only technical' is not at all characteristic of a democratic, fair Union, as we know it. This is why I can only hope that the opinions of the experts and those of the European legislative will not continue to be ignored by politicians from Member States.
Applying this logic in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am questioning the efficiency of the four agencies which we have been discussing: Eurofund, ETF, OSHA and the improbably named Cedefop. I recently myself visited ETF in Turin and also heard a presentation from Cedefop while I was there.
Appointing a head would put a stop to that.
Appropriate safeguarding of the explosion site is still an unresolved issue.
Approval of an ILO Convention on domestic workers would be a first step in plugging the existing gap, by safeguarding rights in connection with their employment, pay rises, the adoption of criteria for employers or even by clarifying that domestic employees need not necessarily stay in the employer's home.
Approval of the Presidency's report on the means for promoting Roma inclusion in the European Union and of the conclusions concerning the launch of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region may mark important steps in the implementation of these vital policies for the European Union.
Approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement (
Are there plans to use this initiative to launch the permanent structured cooperation which has not yet been put into operation? Will you ensure that the European Defence Agency and the EU Military Staff have central responsibility for implementing this initiative?
Are they aware of the report by the Italian Carabinieri of the Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies concerning milk quotas? This report clearly shows that the milk production quota, which was supposed to have been exceeded, thus forming the legal basis for the fines levied on Italian dairy farmers, was not in fact exceeded.
Are we not in danger of concentrating too much on concluding individual agreements, which may prevent us from pursuing a multilateral system with appropriate and sufficient vigour?
Are we spending our money as wisely as we can? Is there not too much of it going on administration? Is there not too much going on bureaucracy and red tape? And is not enough being given towards food security? Again like greening, people talk about food security as a throw-away line.
Are you definitely sure this is the safest method? To my mind, it is not.
Areas of special concern, where an in-depth analysis of the reasons for the delays should be carried out, are the following: the rail sector, certain energy and environmental investments, digital economy, social inclusion, governance and capacity building.
Armed with relevant useful and comparable information, we should, in the near future, be better able to provide EU added value across forestry-related socio-economic and environmental issues, thus paving the way for better EU input to help forests to continue to deliver their multiple benefits for us all.
Arms trafficking in the region also encourages more rebel unrest, while compromising the process of establishing independence.
Around 115 000 people were evacuated from the areas in the vicinity of the reactor, and since 1986 around 220 000 people have been relocated from Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine.
Around 40 people who had taken part in the demonstrations following the elections were charged with civil disorder, which can carry a maximum sentence of 15 years imprisonment.
Around five million people in the European Union are employed in the cultural sector.
Around one third of the students who have participated in the Erasmus programme have experienced difficulties arising from uncertainties over the system of education in other countries and the lack of correspondence and continuity between the subjects of study in the home country and abroad.
Around two years ago, we, Parliament, approved a trading ban with an overwhelming majority, despite the immense pressure from Canada on Parliament and the other institutions to water down the legislation.
Article 138 of the Treaty of Lisbon states that the euro's place in the international monetary system must be strengthened.
Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establishes that the EU 'shall develop and pursue its actions leading to the strengthening of its economic, social and territorial cohesion', and it has therefore set Union funds for the 2007-2013 period at EUR 347 billion, which corresponds to 35.7% of the overall EU budget. I am voting in favour of this report as it sets out an accurate analysis of the current state of Union funds by demonstrating the areas in which, up until now, EUR 93.4 million has been spent, suggests recommendations and areas for improvement, contributes to resolving the economic and financial crisis, and promotes best practices and mutual learning at regional level.
Article 28 of the Charter stipulates that, in line with EU and national laws and practices, workers or their organisations have the right to negotiate and conclude collective agreements at the appropriate levels, and, in cases of conflicts of interest, to take collective action to defend their interests, including strike action.
Article 317 of the Lisbon Treaty explicitly requires the cooperation of Member States in the implementation of the budget.
Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union clearly stipulates that Member States shall coordinate their action in international organisations and that Member States, which are also members of the UN Security Council, will concert and, in the execution of their functions, defend the positions and the interests of the Union.
Article 8 of the chapter on law and procedure on the immunity of Members of the European Parliament stipulates that the latter shall not be subject to any form of inquiry, detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties.
As Amnesty suggested, however, it is vital to link these with the TDIP report and with the follow-up that the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) has agreed to take up in a new own-initiative report.
As Bulgaria and Romania meet the requirements for accession to the Schengen area, I welcome its expansion to include them.
As Canada is a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the Commission must undertake to find a satisfactory solution regarding both industrial products and agricultural or fisheries products, so that Canada does not become a gateway through which goods from other NAFTA members enter Europe.
As Diogo Feio just said, I think the text has actually been improved, and I think that when there is public debate we are doing our job and citizens can be informed about what is going on in Brussels, as they say.
As European legislators, we cannot afford to say to the public: 'Europe is doing nothing because we have not succeeded in reaching an agreement'.
As Europeans, we try systematically to promote values and principles which, for us, are fundamental and inalienable.
As I already announced - and in order to reassure Mr Cancian and all the other honourable Members who have voiced concern about the overly long timescales - I can confirm that we will try to present our work ahead of schedule.
As I always maintain at meetings of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, parents living in poverty mean children raised in poverty.
As I am more strongly attached to freedom of expression than the pseudo democrats in this House, I shall systematically refuse to waive the immunity of one of my fellow Members, from whichever political group, for the expression of his or her opinions, no matter how much they differ from my own.
As I consider safeguarding the 'Made in' label to be a priority issue, I cannot vote in favour, and have therefore chosen to abstain.
As I have already explained, all the matters discussed at that time are linked to national competence.
As I have already said, they are difficulties which, to be fair, concern not only the euro area.
As I have already underlined, we could become competent when the constitution is translated into legislative, administrative or judicial practice. I can assure Parliament that we would not hesitate for a moment to intervene in such a case if the Treaty or the Charter was violated or if Union law was not respected.
As I have indicated, we must expect oil prices to remain high and this economic climate to affect primarily those involved in small-scale fishing.
As I have previously stated, strengthening SMEs is key to promoting economic growth.
As I mentioned in my introductory statement, we are currently implementing a pilot project, at the request of Parliament, to convert precarious work into decent employment, and two calls for proposals have been launched already.
As I pointed out, some questions remain open, such as the relationship between the EGF and the ESF.
As I said at the beginning, I am careful with the use of the word 'historical'. However, in the case of Croatia I think we have indeed come to a historical moment, because we are sending a very important message to the Western Balkans, namely that they have a future in the European Union. I truly hope that the heads of EU Member States and governments will take the political decision tomorrow and the day after tomorrow about the accession of Croatia, and that the negotiations can be concluded in the final hours of the Hungarian Presidency, on 30 June at the latest.
As I said during the March vote, it is important to bear in mind the various national particularities and the protection offered, with proper respect for the subsidiarity principle.
As I said regarding the Youth on the Move initiative, education is an essential instrument in ensuring the realisation of the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy.
As I said, I tell citizens that I believe that they are protected, but I cannot guarantee it. It is my understanding, for example, that one of these companies was convicted in one region of Spain, and yet all it did was simply move to another region and continue its work.
As I said, good partners do not haul each other before WTO courts on account of their convictions.
As I see it, if we are to improve the European Union's representation in multilateral organisations, we must first find a consensus. I am pleased to see that the Union has supported the United Nations' strategy, particularly in the case of humanitarian policy and conflict resolution.
As I see it, this report also illustrates the need for better information exchange between Member States and European agencies and, above all, for Croatia's potential accession to be prepared in a calmer manner than the 'major' enlargement of 2004 and 2007, when the countries of Central and Eastern Europe joined the EU.
As I see it, what is most important is the question of what MEPs are allowed to do. Are MEPs only allowed to work in a professional capacity here in Parliament, or are they also allowed to undertake other activities in addition to their work in Parliament? I personally believe that these other activities should be very narrowly defined, and should be limited to scientific work and publications.
As I understand it, EP priorities are: an enhanced role for the EU in the UN system, taking into account the institutional changes brought by the Lisbon Treaty; a need for guidelines ensuring proper consultations between the ambassadors of the Member States in order to avoid discordance of EU voices as in the case of Libya; an adequate budget for UN Women; further strengthening of the role of the ICC; support for the UN Mediation Unit and a key role for the EEAS in this context; improvement of the relationship between the UN Peacebuilding Commission and the EU Peace-building Partnership; and finally, stronger EU leadership in the area of global climate governance.
As I understand, the report contains a legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement.
As I understood it, the Commission had listed 200 indications that it intended to protect via an agreement that would come into force before the free trade agreement.
As Joseph Stiglitz expressed it so well, GDP is not only an instrument which is inadequate for reflecting citizens' welfare, but it is also restricted to measuring economic market activity. I hope that the European executive will come up with specific proposals for additional, more extensive and sustainable indicators so as to remedy the current shortcomings.
As Mr Cassini said, the term 'lobbyist' is somewhat unfortunate because it creates the impression of privilege or corruption or both, whereas in reality these are experts in their field who help to inform us of the intricacies and the nuances of the various pieces of legislation that we are proposing.
As Mr Daul rightly said, that is how to make the life of a Finance Minister easier - by indicating new own resources for the budget and reducing the direct contribution.
As Mr Reul said, we must, of course, encourage excellence.
As Mr Verhofstadt said, we need the support of the Commission to really move and change and have a new strategy and a new ambition in the long and the short term.
As Mrs Honeyball said, I believe it is one of the issues that has not been given the attention it deserves.
As Parliament has also come to have powers in relation to air agreements, it is important to ensure that it has access to information throughout the negotiation process.
As Parliament is now on an equal footing with the Council as regards recasting this regulation, there is a real and unique opportunity to reinforce Member States' accountability, and it should not be missed.
As Parliament, we would like to see an annual debate on the performance audit of the Commission and we would like you to be invited here to debate it with us as a representative of the European Court of Auditors.
As Socialist coordinator on human rights, I also want to congratulate the High Representative on her strategic review of human rights and on the commitment in her letter to foreign ministers to integrate human rights with trade development and other EU policies and to achieve 'specific deliverables'. In this Parliament, we called on her to create a human rights and democracy directorate and to consistently meet human rights defenders in all of her visits, and we thank her for doing so. When she says that ending the death penalty is her personal priority, this Parliament must also give her our strong support.
As Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I feel compelled to underline how important it is that we all cooperate, including outside the EU, to eliminate gender discrimination and gender violence so as to restore the social dignity of women and revive their active contribution to the local and supranational economy alike.
As Vice-Chair of the working group on urban issues, I attach great importance to the impact that cohesion policy can have in our towns, especially in areas that are struggling. I voted in favour of this report, for in it my colleague Mr Vlasák promotes an important role for urban areas and comes up with a clever compromise between local, national and European responsibilities.
As a Bulgarian politician, I am following with particular interest the developments concerning the intermediate category of beneficiary regions, which is planned to be created in the new 2013-2020 budget framework.
As a Christian-Democrat, I am absolutely delighted that there is a reference to God and Christianity, because it is a fundamental part of our culture and our history and I think it is far better to have it included than excluded and creating a godless society.
As a Commissioner who is taking over a responsibility which he does not have, you should have said: 'Mrs Harms, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I have taken on a big task, but I have only made a small amount of progress'. You should have referred to the fact that there are major problems, that the stress tests are purely voluntary, that they are only being carried out on paper and that they are largely in the hands of the operators, which is where they always have been.
As a Member of Parliament representing a constituency very much affected by cross-border issues, and as someone who comes from the only region in France which shares a border with three other EU Member States, I take a great interest in these issues and in projects for cross-border cooperation.
As a consequence of the economic and financial crisis, Europe has been faced with a sharp fall in demand for commercial and passenger vehicles, thereby resulting in a considerable decline in motor vehicle production. A 23.8% drop in the assembly of motor vehicles and a 34.8% fall in the production of passenger vehicles were recorded in Belgium in 2009, compared with 2008.
As a country with such an exceptional status, however, it has promised, in the signing of mutual agreements as a partner of the EU, to uphold the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, which are fundamental preconditions for such cooperation.
As a direct result, both SMEs and consumers tend to carry out transactions within the domestic market, which is often much less competitive, and therefore do not access the cross-border market, in which products are often at least 10% cheaper than the domestic offer.
As a doctor, I would also like to say that drug abuse can have extremely grave and irreversible consequences for human health. I therefore support effective international cooperation in the fight against the illegal trade in drugs or their precursors and, at the same time, I would like to mention the need for prevention.
As a doctor, I would like to emphasise, above all, the impact on human health.
As a friend, albeit critical friend, of Bulgaria, I wish to do all I can to assist progress in that country, but not at the expense of my own country's well-being. I therefore abstained in the vote.
As a group, we favour the amendment brought forward by another group requiring that the money spent on lobbying should also be listed in the transparency register; we intend supporting this amendment.
As a last-resort mechanism, and if the critical situation justifies it, these decisions could make provision for the temporary reintroduction of internal border controls, but always within a Community framework.
As a matter of priority, therefore, it should be extended to northern, eastern and south-eastern Europe.
As a member of the Basque Friendship Group 'Toward a peace process in the Basque Country', I was among those signing the declaration aimed at requesting the Spanish Government to reconsider its position and take all necessary measures to ensure that the elections held on 22 May respect basic democratic principles.
As a member of the Committee on Culture and Education, I support the 'Innovation Union' initiative. I would stress the role played by education, vocational training and social research (into the fight against poverty and social exclusion) within the framework of this initiative.
As a member of the Committee on Development, it is precisely this aspect that I would like to emphasise.
As a member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I am sure that the aviation industry is one of the sectors where cooperation on trade and research and development would have mutual benefits for both the European and Japanese economies. I believe that the aeronautics sector could become one of the models for cooperation between the EU and Japan.
As a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and a committed environmental campaigner, I expected a Dess report which would represent a CAP for the carbon era - one based upon environmental incentives, resource management, and a strong investment in the wider environmental issues facing the EU. As such, I am impressed by the degree to which the Dess report has committed to greening CAP; to supporting small- and medium-sized food producers; and to looking towards the future while also addressing the current concerns which face European agriculture.
As a member of the Subcommittee on Security and Defence, I have followed this report closely.
As a permanent member of the UN Security Council, Russia exercises a potentially decisive influence on international affairs, from our relations with North Korea to its involvement in the UN quartet. I also welcome recent calls by President Medvedev for the Libyan tyrant, Muammar Gaddafi, to leave power. I also hope that the Kremlin will align itself with the rest of the international community on stopping Iranian nuclear proliferation.
As a representative of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, I am also pleased to be able to point out that this has been brought about by Dutch members of the ALDE Group in particular.
As a representative of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I took part in the work and negotiations on the Late Payments Directive, which is one of the key legislative proposals announced in the original version of the Small Business Act. I hope the Member States will take pains to implement its provisions as quickly as possible and correctly.
As a representative of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I would like to pose a question to the President of the Commission, who has been busy dealing with the pictures that we have been seeing in recent weeks from the Mediterranean, where many people fleeing from the situation in Africa have made it to Europe, while some have also failed to make it. We have had to see the images of these stranded and dead people on the news.
As a result of measures that aim to internalise external costs, economic efficiency is likely to increase and negative environmental effects will decrease.
As a result of the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, Member States have unfortunately lost their prerogatives regarding the management of foreign direct investment, which has become the exclusive competence of the Union.
As a result of the deep economic and financial crisis that is affecting the industry and small and medium-sized enterprises, the price of a barrel of oil has increased, and its price is still uncertain because of the risk of political instability in the Arab world.
As a result of the digitisation of terrestrial television broadcasting, a large number of frequencies, referred to as digital dividends, are being made available.
As a result of the economic crisis, some Member States no longer have as many opportunities to provide support for the programme, and this is a challenge to the EU to identify accurately those who need support, and to grant support to them.
As a result of the global economic crisis and the instability that continues to plague the euro area, the Commission proposed a number of legislative initiatives, cumulatively known as the Economic Governance Package.
As a result of the prevalent and increasing economic competition in the world, conditions for workers are deteriorating further, with workers' pay being the main victim of cuts and the working age being extended, in an attempt to make profits.
As a result of the provision on revision the co-legislators can make informed decisions because the Commission will conduct an in-depth survey on further compulsory labelling requirements.
As a result of the tremendous efforts made by Croatia, the Commission and the Presidency with the essential support of this House - for which it deserves immense credit - the European Council will call for the conclusion of the accession negotiations with Croatia by the end of June 2011.
As a result of this piece of legislation, amongst other things, the market pretty much collapsed, as the number of animals killed fell from 217 000 in 2008 to 38 000 this year, while the price of fur also fell from USD 100 in 2006 to USD 15 in 2009.
As a result, European territory is divided and split by a great many administrative borders which define different political and legal systems.
As a result, I voted in favour of the review to the Small Business Act, which is a resolution that recognises the crucial role of SMEs in the European economy. I support a strategic framework that goes even further in the help granted to SMEs in times of recession, and this in many areas.
As a result, Parliament's work has become the focus of attention of a growing number of lobbyists, who act as an important source of information for Members. I therefore welcome the proposal to establish and maintain a common register in order to exercise scrutiny over the organisations and individuals who take part in the drafting and implementation of EU policies.
As a result, among other things, of the rise in imported fishery and aquaculture products on the European market, that sector is becoming increasingly fragile.
As a result, fresh plaice is sold at far below the cost price or withdrawn from the market and auctioned off.
As a result, it is the focus for the attention of an even larger number of lobbyists, who, moreover, play a key role in the open, pluralist dialogue on which a democratic system is based and act as an important source of information for Members in the performance of their duties It is, however, essential to establish mechanisms for recording and monitoring.
As a result, it is the focus of attention of an even larger number of lobbyists, who, moreover, play a key role in the open, pluralist dialogue on which a democratic system is based and act as an important source of information for Members in the context of the performance of their duties In the light of these developments, and against this constitutional background, Parliament and the Commission have agreed to establish and maintain a common register in order to keep a list of the names of, and exercise scrutiny over, the organisations and individuals who take part in the drafting and implementation of EU policies.
As a result, it is the focus of attention of an even larger number of lobbyists, who, moreover, play a key role in the open, pluralist dialogue on which a democratic system is based and act as an important source of information for Members in the context of the performance of their duties.
As a result, it is the focus of attention of an even larger number of lobbyists, who, moreover, play a key role in the open, pluralist dialogue on which a democratic system is based, and act as an important source of information for Members in the context of the performance of their duties In the light of these developments, and against this constitutional background, and in keeping with their commitment to transparency, Parliament and the Commission have agreed to establish and maintain a common register in order to keep a list of the names of, and exercise scrutiny over, the organisations and individuals taking part in the drafting and implementation of EU policies The register will be established and kept on the basis of the existing arrangements introduced by Parliament in 1996 and by the Commission in June 2008, as developed by the joint Parliament-Commission working party and on the basis of the experience gained and the suggestions made by the parties concerned The work towards transparency must continue.
As a result, it is the focus of attention of an even larger number of lobbyists, who, moreover, play a key role in the open, pluralist dialogue on which a democratic system is based, and act as an important source of information for Members in the context of the performance of their duties.
As a result, it is the focus of attention of an even larger number of lobbyists, who, moreover, play a key role in the open, pluralist dialogue, and act as an important source of information for Members in the context of the performance of their duties.
As a result, the European Commission has published a Green Paper on the subject and launched a broad public consultation. I voted for Parliament's present resolution for it takes a common sense approach by proposing an instrument that is concurrent with national legislation and would facilitate cross-border trade.
As a result, the European Parliament no longer has any influence over how macroeconomic imbalances are dealt with.
As a result, the national governments would be unable to adequately assert their own interests in international forums.
As a result, they would no longer be under the President of the Commission's instructions.
As a result, to a not inconsiderable degree, of the setbacks caused by the economic crisis, but also, and above all, as a result of structural deficiencies in many - almost all - Member States in other areas, the Member States of the EU have completely different prerequisites.
As a rule, agencies carry out external evaluations of their work programmes at regular intervals, and these take such performance indicators into account.
As a share of GDP, the EU invests less than the US and Japan in research and development, and venture capital investment is also lacking.
As a social democrat who emphasizes the fundamental of social rights of the people and the long-term well being of the society, I support this proposal for its depth and comprehensiveness in addressing these issues.
As a substitute member of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, I voted in favour of this report, but I would stress again that Parliament should take up its new responsibilities enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon, and be kept informed at all stages of the process of negotiating international agreements.
As advocated by the rapporteur, I too urge the European Commission to continue applying pressure to approve these proposals, as the measures provided for in the agreement will only be truly effective at combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing if and when they are applied in a comprehensive, uniform and transparent manner, in order to avoid loopholes that could be easily exploited by the IUU fishing operators.
As affirmed by the proposed amendments made by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, the military interventions, supposedly undertaken in order to stabilise certain countries or regions, are on the wrong track.
As agreed, the Commission will report to Parliament and the Council every three years on the development of new modules and, if appropriate, the Commission may also put forward new legislative proposals for the new modules.
As already happens to some extent, Moscow can supply us with mineral and energy resources as well as collaborate on military security and the fight against terrorism and organised crime Europe can contribute with financial resources, scientific and technological capabilities and our long-standing experience in the field of democracy and human rights.
As an Italian Member of the European Parliament I welcome the candidature of Mario Draghi as President of the European Central Bank (ECB). I listened to his hearing at the European Parliament on 14 June.
As an elected representative from a port town, I strongly support my fellow Members in demanding that the Commission authorise an increase in the de minimis aid ceilings.
As an elected representative of a cross-border region, I paid particular attention to this issue, and I am pleased that we have called for reinforced cooperation for local authorities, which means both cooperation between authorities and cooperation with the European institutions.
As an example, as Mr Audy reminded us, we have already implemented three concrete simplification measures for FP7: more use of average personnel costs, easier procedures for owner-managers of SMEs, and a clearing committee to ensure a common interpretation of the rules.
As an integral part of the decision, a chronological list indicates, for every year until 2019, the two Member States which are entitled to hold the title.
As approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I confirm the importance of supporting the introduction of ceilings for direct payments awarded to large economic players. I think the introduction of a system of degressivity of aid as the size of a holding increases above a certain threshold is necessary to avoid overcompensating larger holdings that already enjoy major economies of scale.
As can already be seen from the examples of Greece, Portugal and Spain, it establishes a radical austerity policy which has consequences that are hard to predict for the future of the European project as a whole.
As can be seen from previous reports, in spite of substantial financial investment and very good logistics and management, European forces could not cope with simple police missions in Kosovo and Bosnia.
As entities that are dependent on the financial system and very much stakeholders in the ratings they issue, they make a living, above all, from disproportionately stimulating credit and capitalist financial speculation.
As far as I am aware, control over the executive is one of the fundamental tasks of MEPs.
As far as I am concerned, I believe that this agreement with a country with which we have a long-standing bond of friendship is important as long as it is entered into on the right basis, that of true reciprocity, and is a balanced and ambitious agreement.
As far as I am concerned, I think we should all familiarise ourselves a little more with the text of the European constitution, which did not actually materialise but which had the motto 'United in diversity', and try to be a little more tolerant of the fact that everyone is different.
As far as I am concerned, it provides a good example of what should happen.
As far as I am concerned, that reference is too vague and leaves too much room for subsequent court judgments contradicting it. It should be stipulated in the constitution, as is the norm in European countries, and as is the norm in the most advanced and progressive democracies.
As far as I am concerned, the European Parliament's operating budget is in keeping with the financial climate.
As far as I know, Mrs Jordan Cizelj wanted to say something about this.
As far as bioethanol is concerned, I would stress that important investments have been made in the EU in this new industry.
As far as cohesion policy is concerned, the message is clear. 'Yes' to a cohesion policy with sufficient financing to make a decisive contribution to development, to new jobs and to innovation. 'Yes' to an independent cohesion policy. 'Yes' to coordination at all policy making levels, from strategic planning through to implementation. 'Yes' to the creation of an intermediate category of support for the regions. 'Yes' to special measures for island and mountainous areas in Europe.
As far as corporate social responsibility is concerned, it is undoubtedly a good idea, and has been under discussion since the early 1970s.
As far as energy security is concerned, we are of the belief that the supply of natural resources should not be used as a means of applying political pressure, but must be based on the principles of interdependence and transparency, together with equal access to markets, infrastructure and investment, so as to establish a legally binding energy framework.
As far as environmental protection is concerned, I think that it is important for the European Union to refuse to import oil extracted from oil sands.
As far as excise duties are concerned, the harmonisation of structures must, in particular, result in competition in the different categories of manufactured tobacco belonging to the same group not being distorted by the effects of charging the tax and, consequently, in the opening of the Member States' national markets.
As far as free movement of persons is concerned, let me tell you that at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 9 June the Hungarian Presidency unanimously adopted a conclusion stating that free movement has to be preserved, that we need to revise the measures already available to us, and only after we have exhausted them and only if new problems actually arise, requiring the adjustment of our current acquis, can we take extraordinary measures in extraordinary situations, and that the modalities should only be elaborated once there is a concrete legislative proposal at hand, which, as far as I know, will happen this autumn.
As far as national forest programmes (NFPs) are concerned, while I fully support their establishment, I would draw attention to their shortcomings. NFPs must become a reality and actually reach the forests so that they can be truly as effective as we intend for them to be.
As far as ordinary development cooperation is concerned, the European Commission has committed itself to spending 20% of the aid on primary and secondary education and on primary health care.
As far as other issues are concerned, please remember that I am not concerned with the question of whether nuclear power stations are being operated, planned, constructed or shut down.
As far as the 'six-pack' is concerned, there will be an in-depth debate on it soon in this House.
As far as the EU's role in multilateral security organisations is concerned, it has been said that the regulations which make it possible for the European Union to benefit from NATO funding should be streamlined.
As far as the EU-India Free Trade Agreement is concerned, I chose to vote for the resolution proposed by my political group as I felt that it is more balanced than the resolutions proposed by other political groups.
As far as the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is concerned, the final declaration of the summit next week must be more than just fine words.
As far as the ceasefire is concerned, we have been calling for a ceasefire to allow safe access for humanitarian assistance and, of course, we very much support the UN in this regard. I can assure you that we are in constant contact with the UN and the UNHCR so that we can deploy assistance when a window of opportunity opens up, as we have now done on numerous occasions, for example in the case of Misrata.
As far as the cross-border area is concerned, we should finally get the European private company under way.
As far as the incentives for fleet renewal are concerned, we must also consider that we must not unilaterally burden our local carriers and fleet-owners with strict environmental and safety regulations, only for the low-cost competitors to come riding over the border in foul scrap vehicles.
As far as the radio spectrum is concerned, our policy must have realistic yet ambitious objectives so that European companies are able to compete in the world market on a sounder footing.
As far as the trade in goods is concerned, I would highlight the high average tariffs imposed by India on both agricultural and industrial goods.
As far as the various national lobby groups are concerned, it has been clearly stated that these will not be included in the register. I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their willingness to compromise on this matter.
As far as vocational education and training are concerned, Member States need to take into consideration the individual needs of low-skilled workers, migrant learners, people belonging to ethnic minorities, women, the unemployed and people with disabilities. I call on Member States to support innovative activities, as well as doctoral and post-doctoral programmes, which will underpin competitiveness and sustainable economic growth.
As far as vocational education and training are concerned, the key factors listed in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth need to be translated into practical steps at European Union level.
As far as we are concerned, it is in the interests of both consumers and businesses to ensure that any burden imposed on importers of goods from third countries serves to control and limit such goods.
As far as we are concerned, then, no stakeholder, whoever he or she may be, can claim to have a kind of pre-emptive right, a kind of vested right, over spectrum, and I believe that this is something that is established in this report.
As far back as 2005, the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, pledged that all the rights of journalists would be respected and that they would be able to count on help in the event of any kind of danger.
As for creating an intermediate category for regions whose GDP is between 75 and 90% of average European GDP, I am in agreement, provided a double condition is met.
As for introducing a system of own resources, I remain extremely hesitant about the unilateral introduction of a tax on financial transactions without a serious impact study.
As for my last point, I wanted to thank Mr Kármán very specifically on the small point of 'comply or explain'. I have asked you so many times during our discussions: what does that mean, 'comply or explain', and explain to whom? You have been a good lawyer; you have moved the Council along.
As for spreading European culture, well make the most of it, because the way this crazy EU is going, there will be none left, just a meaningless mantra: 'United in Diversity'. Do you not understand that Europe is not a single state but a wide and glorious tapestry of attractive, distinctive but matching cultural panels, and to amalgamate them is to reduce them all to a grey amorphous mass, thereby destroying that which you say you admire?
As for the Middle East, I am not exactly in agreement with you.
As for the cultural dimension, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the information that the European External Action Service is going to have ambassadors and cultural attachés in all the countries of the world. I would like to thank Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, because support for culture means, above all, support for the business connected with culture, but, in particular, it means support for the inner aspect of culture.
As for the future, I would like to remind the Commission of the commitments which it made in October 2010, mainly, to ban cloning techniques for producing food in the European Union.
As for the issue that you raised, Mr Gauzès, with regard to excessive dependence on ratings, we are going to get rid of a number of ratings very shortly, at the beginning of July.
As for the other question, there was a Health Council yesterday which dealt with the issue.
As for the priorities themselves, they are those imposed by the European Union: repaying private creditors, reassuring the markets, dismantling social security and accelerating liberalisation at every turn, in keeping with the EU 2020 strategy.
As for the question of genetically modified organisms, I would remind the House that the Union and Canada have signed a mutually acceptable solution to resolve this difference.
As for young farmers, support measures and incentives have been introduced to help and encourage them to set up farms.
As four years have passed since Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 came into force, and as the Commission has already announced the tabling of proposals relating to the Multiannual Financial Framework for the post-2013 period, there is a need for a brief analysis of the results achieved since then and of future means of development.
As has already been mentioned by a few Members, my group is also strongly opposed to the Commission's approach of using the agreement to force the liberalisation of services by means of a 'negative list'. This turns on its head the approach that has been taken up to now where the contracting partners define the areas that they actively want to open.
As has already been said, our first demand is obviously the revision of this Euratom Treaty, which has remained virtually unchanged since it was first drawn up. Admittedly, the audit of the 143 nuclear reactors in Europe will, in the end, only relate to the 'Fukushima' scenario, and you have clearly set the limits for this, Commissioner.
As has already been said, this report, together with previous reports and the Commission's communication, seeks to demonstrate that Europe's aim is to have a common agricultural policy that guarantees food security in Europe and contributes to global food security.
As has been emphasised on several occasions today as well during the debate, I think that this issue requires further discussion because, at the moment, a precondition is being established for new divisions and exclusions in the treatment of individual regions, which goes against the European principle of solidarity.
As has been said many times, we are very close to achieving the goal, but at the same time it is important that we are successful in the voting today and in July. I would also like to thank Mr Kármán from the Hungarian Presidency, who has done a splendid job.
As has been said, domestic work is often undervalued, or seen as traditional women's work that 'anybody can do', but we have also made the point that a lot of it is actually quite skilled.
As has been said, the Managing Director must be someone who seeks consensus and is effective at a time when the institution has a vital role to play in helping to redress the economic and financial balance with a great sense of purpose.
As has rightly been mentioned here, fuel costs have a very acute impact on the survival of our small and medium-sized shipping companies, seriously exacerbating already fragile incomes from fishing, in particular.
As human rights are a key aspect of the agreement binding the EU and Pakistan, the autonomous trade preferences proposed must be dependent upon respect for human rights in this country.
As if that were not enough, the rivalries between the tribes and armed groups in South Sudan are also on the rise, and observers estimate that more than a thousand people have already lost their lives since January.
As in previous cases, the Court of Auditors has stated that its actions are legal and regular.
As in the past, we must now adopt temporary emergency measures to overcome the difficulties faced by the fisheries sector against the backdrop of rising oil prices.
As in the vote in committee, I advocated a Community vision and stated that agreements that were already standing should be closely examined by the Commission in order to check their compatibility with the Treaties and with Union law and Union policy, in particular the objectives of the Union's external action on sustainable development.
As innovation is a fundamental objective of regional policy, in future, Europe must adopt a strategic management approach, establishing appropriate policy instruments that will enable its evolution to be monitored and the necessary adjustments to be made.
As is known, after the unprecedented and devastating floods in Pakistan in July and August 2010, the European Council at its meeting on 16 September mandated Ministers to agree urgently a comprehensive package of short-, medium- and longer-term measures which will help underpin Pakistan's recovery and future development.
As is known, financial control of the execution of the Community budget takes place at three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control by the European Court of Auditors; and the discharge procedure of the European Parliament.
As is mentioned in the resolution, the European Parliament has received more than 400 petitions on the subject of widespread misleading trading practices by publishers of business directories which affect thousands of businesses, mostly small ones.
As it assumes the EU Presidency, Poland has already found roads to a more fruitful dialogue with Russia, so that we can expect concrete steps to be taken in EU-Russia relations in the coming six months.
As it is also my role to ask questions, I would like to ask my colleague the following: do you believe that the belttightening taking place in Portugal will allow you to achieve the kind of economic growth that will enable the loans to be repaid?
As it is located in a sensitive area in terms of illegal migration, Bulgaria should adopt additional measures to respond to a possible increase in migratory pressure at its borders.
As it is required to do each year, the European Parliament has been asked for a decision on whether the Union budget has been properly implemented by the various agencies and institutions who are responsible for it. The sums are allocated for specific purposes and the aim of the discharge procedure is to check in retrospect that these purposes have been adhered to. This is an important prerogative of Parliament, as illustrated for example by its influence on the resignation of the Santer Commission in 1999.
As long ago as 2002, Parliament called for reliable information to be collected on the state of the environment and the most important trends in, influences on, and causes of, environmental change, and for the public to be informed of these things.
As long as this obvious discrepancy exists, the effectiveness and rationale of this report will necessarily be limited.
As many of you have underlined, it is an essential building block in our comprehensive policy response to the current and still ongoing financial and sovereign crisis.
As many people have said, including the Commission, we need some form of clarification and simplification of what rules actually apply when it comes to the shipping of toxic waste to developing countries, so that it will be easier for the police and other border control officers to take measures to deal with the crimes against the environment that the export of hazardous waste actually entails.
As many people warned a year ago, the International Monetary Fund-European Union (IMF-EU) programme for Greece has not only caused economic disaster and social devastation, but it has proved incapable of fulfilling the very objectives that allegedly justified it: the deficit reduction targets have not been met, the country's public debt must be around 170% at the moment and the interest rates that the markets require on the public debt have soared.
As mentioned by the rapporteur, I would stress the need for the Commission and the Principality of Andorra to engage in further talks in order to take into account and if necessary to adapt bilateral agreements to the ongoing implementation of the Modernised Customs Code, which should be completed within the EU within two years.
As my colleague, Bas Eickhout, said before, freezing or decreasing the EU's budget post-2013 is not a credible approach if the EU and its Member States are serious about achieving the policy priorities they have set themselves, notably in the Europe 2020 strategy.
As my colleague, Danny Cohn-Bendit, asked you, who is the one - or who are the ones - who blocked it in the Council? Is it Mr Westerwelle or who? Tell us, and you will find support from us if you are transparent and open with us. I think that will get support for you.
As my colleague, Mrs Bélier, has said, although this report could have gone further with the ambitions and guidelines that it could have set, it does represent a first step and a strong signal sent out to the Council and the Commission for Europe to press ahead with an overhaul of the wealth and development indicators so as to make them more representative of the environmental and social realities and constraints with which we are confronted.
As my fellow Members have already said, at least three years have passed, three years during which these people, these hustlers, as they have rightly been called by numerous fellow Members - and I am with them - are misleading colleagues and are misleading small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the backbone of the European economy.
As my group's shadow Rapporteur I would like to congratulate Mrs Goulard on the adoption of her report and to thank her for the good co-operation between us throughout these difficult negotiations. I chose to abstain on this report and on the proposed amendment on fiscal convergence. I regret that despite the Rapporteur's best efforts the Council watered down or removed numerous intelligent proposals from the text, which made it impossible for me to endorse the report.
As noted by the rapporteur, we fully agree that the budget should be aimed at achieving the EU 2020 strategy, competitiveness and employment, but this major concern must not further distract us from the chronic underfunding of the Union's external action.
As nuclear energy will remain part of the Member States' energy mix in the future it is important that such a report is adopted successfully in the plenary session of this Parliament.
As part of a possible response strategy, we will be looking at a number of important elements: stepping up the EU presence in Juba by establishing an EU delegation; initiating comprehensive political dialogue; stabilising South Sudan and the joint border through specific measures and instruments - including the Common Security and Defence Policy and the Instrument for Stability - and increasing development assistance.
As part of our preparatory work, the Commission is exploring the idea of candidate countries joining the initiative after 2019. I would also inform you that a number of cities in other third countries have already shown an interest.
As part of the Innovation Union, a pilot European Innovation Partnership has been proposed with the aim of covering the whole of the innovation chain, from research and development onwards, in order to guarantee that adequate conditions are in place to bring the results of research and development successfully to the market.
As part of the legislative package aimed at reinforcing economic governance in the EU and the euro area, there has also been a vote on this draft opinion on the Commission's proposal amending the regulation on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure. I voted for this report because I essentially share the rapporteur's concerns, particularly as regards the following points: 1) the enforcement of budgetary surveillance should be subject to the overarching objectives of the EU; 2) in monitoring compliance with the rules on budgetary discipline, consideration should be given, not only to severe economic downturns, but also to social crises that may have an impact on the financial position of governments; 3) fines collected from Member States failing to comply with their respective recommendations should be used in support of the EU's long-term investment and job targets, and not distributed only to the Member States that are not subject to any procedure relating to excessive deficits, as the Commission proposed; 4) regular consultation of the social partners and a stronger involvement of national parliaments are necessary preconditions of a credible and transparent surveillance framework.
As part of the legislative package aimed at reinforcing the economic governance in the EU and the euro area, there has also been a vote on this draft opinion on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies. I voted for this report because I essentially share the rapporteur's concerns, particularly as regards amendments pertaining to the following key issues: 1) the EU's framework for budgetary surveillance should be broadened so as to include employment and social aspects; 2) the guidelines for Member States' employment policies should be taken into account when they present their respective stability and convergence programmes, as well as during the examination of those programmes; 3) the multilateral surveillance of the stability and convergence programmes should be conducted as part of the European Semester; and 4) the stability and convergence programmes of the Member States should include information on the consistency of the Member States' budgetary objectives with the EU's growth and jobs strategy, such as the Europe 2020 strategy, and in particular with the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the Guidelines for the Employment Policies.
As part of the mechanism for cooperation in the area of nuclear safety, we are considering a project aimed at helping the most significantly affected population groups around the Chernobyl exclusion zone.
As part of the negotiations it is conducting, the European Commission must strive both to promote a more transparent regulatory policy, which will help European companies to understand fully the rules for conducting trade with Japanese partners, and to deregulate access to public procurement.
As part of the ongoing negotiations on the trade agreement between the EU and Canada, the Commission must undertake to comply with the European Parliament's demands.
As part of this endeavour, the European Union, in cooperation with the Member States, should seek to amend existing legislation, so as to cover domestic employees and, most importantly, to encourage cooperation between the Member States and exchanges of best practices.
As part of this process, a new form of cooperation between committees was developed and introduced by means of the new Rule 51. Some doubts were raised about the implementation of this new form of cooperation between committees, which were referred to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs.
As permanent rapporteur in the area of the legal basis of legislation in the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs, I would like to draw attention to one aspect of the report in particular - the question of its legal basis.
As point eight of the discharge report concerning the European Council says, this progress is due to the positive attitude and efforts of the Hungarian Presidency.
As pointed out by the amendments tabled by our group, military intervention or any sort of military approach to conflict resolution, with the alleged aim of stabilising certain regions or countries, is the wrong track.
As politicians, we have a constant tendency, if we want to achieve something, to throw a new layer on top, additional regulation, an additional programme, an additional funding option.
As public sector jobs in the UK as a whole are becoming less certain, and more of my constituents are, I hope, going to be either setting up or working for small businesses, I fully support and endorse the ambitious targets for reducing the administrative burden on SMEs, and goals such as the SME test for all legislation.
As rapporteur for next year's discharge, I mean to continue cooperating closely with the Council to that end, but for the moment the deferral is still necessary.
As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I wish to highlight the important role that culture and creativity play in the European economy and in reaching the targets of the Europe 2020 strategy, for a society based on knowledge and innovation, as well as the potential new jobs they represent.
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development on this report, I am delighted that it has been adopted today by the plenary of the European Parliament.
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I would like to thank my fellow Members in the Committee on International Trade for adopting the main points which we developed in our opinion. I want to highlight two of these points here.
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for this report, I believe that achieving and sustaining quality of life involves important, interlinked factors such as health, education, culture, jobs, housing and environmental conditions. I therefore believe that the indicators measuring these factors are also important, and that more importance should be attached to them. I voted in favour because this report is a step, albeit a hesitant one, towards improving and complementing gross domestic product (GDP) as an instrument for the measurement and evaluation of social and economic performance, and, by association, of the progress of societies.
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I sought to uphold this idea by drawing attention to some of the main challenges we are facing in the following areas, to cite but a few examples: the scarcity and efficient use of resources, waste recovery and treatment, food quality and security, demographic change, new epidemics, and conservation of nature and biodiversity.
As rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I was given an opportunity to experience first-hand how the technical proposal became a highly political subject overnight, and therefore I would also like to thank all of my fellow Members who succeeded in maintaining an objective approach, even in the face of pressure following the disaster in Japan.
As rapporteur in previous years for the subject of better law making, I would like to highlight several aspects of this problem.
As regards Russia itself, the new paradigm is what is known as the Partnership for Modernisation.
As regards access to the services sector, unfortunately, there appears to be no clear commitment on the part of India at present.
As regards gender mainstreaming in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, and to make civilian and military missions more effective, I recommend that female personnel be involved as appropriate at every level of crisis management. I would stress the need for women to be included in senior-level decision-making positions, regular consultations with civil society, and that capacity to work on gender issues within missions be enhanced. I call for the establishment of adequate public complaint procedures in the context of common security and defence policy (CSDP) missions, and call on Lady Ashton to include a detailed report on women, peace and security in the six-monthly evaluation of CSDP missions. I believe this would enable the experience acquired to be turned to account from a political, strategic, technical, legal and operational point of view and, in the long term, could provide a starting point for improving interventions under way and for criteria to be applied to emerging crises so as to make for the best possible balance between strategic interests and available resources.
As regards immigration, I have heard Italy criticised for not wanting to accept any refugees. A few hours ago, however, Mrs Malmström issued a public statement saying that when the tragedy of the Libyan exodus began everyone undertook to receive at least 800 refugees per country.
As regards information, we are supplying continuous information as we receive it. In this respect, we at the Commission agree that coordinated and rapid communication is an essential element of risk management.
As regards interest rates, a contribution is required from the banks, which made huge profits by purchasing debts at 16% and then doubled their capital when they dropped to 8%. I also propose an investigation into financial transactions involving sovereign debt, which the European Securities and Markets Authority could be entrusted with carrying out.
As regards manufactured tobacco, the achievement of this aim presupposes that the application in the Member States of taxes affecting the consumption of products in this sector does not distort conditions of competition and does not impede their free movement within the European Union.
As regards misleading practices in business directories, which are common and have a disastrous effect on businesses, I consider it a good sign that the relevant legislation is being overhauled so as to put an end to the misleading practices used by publishers of business directories, namely through the creation of a blacklist of misleading practices used by business directories.
As regards national declarations, which has also been raised several times, I propose that we should solve this in the debate on the Financial Regulation. I know there are proposals concerning this.
As regards our emerging strategic partners around the globe, we have witnessed recently how culture can become an integral part of our external relations. I am more committed than ever to advancing further this very important dimension of our European agenda for culture.
As regards provisions that would oblige Pakistan to abstain from maintaining, introducing or increasing duties or charges having equivalent effect, or any other restriction on the export or import of certain products, I believe that such conditions would seriously undermine the granting of the preferences and are contrary to the spirit, the nature and the purpose of our regulation.
As regards public services, the Commission's chosen 'negative list' approach is dangerous.
As regards the 2012 budget, I would like to point out that the draft budget that was adopted by the Commission on 20 April is in line with the European Council conclusions of 24 and 25 March, which state that fiscal consolidation efforts must be complemented by growth-enhancing structural reforms.
As regards the European semester, we are committed to successfully concluding this on time.
As regards the Manders recommendation on textile names and related labelling of textile products, I voted in favour of the compromise proposal by the political groups because I am in favour of a compulsory system of labelling of the country of origin of third-country textile products. I also consider that this may promote fair competition in the EU and on the international stage.
As regards the Nuclear Waste Directive, I would say that we will have more opportunities than you have mentioned in your speech to discuss it next time, and I hope that the European Commission will take into account the proposals of the European Parliament because, in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, we have voted for several stronger proposals than were originally proposed by the European Commission?.
As regards the Stability and Growth Pact, we cannot accept an instrument whose only outcome is and will remain austerity, austerity and more austerity, in other words which will result in making only the most vulnerable in our societies pay for the economic crisis.
As regards the actual catches, they should be limited to surpluses and to those stocks that cannot be caught by Mauritania's fishing fleet, so that the environmental equilibrium can be maintained and the activity can remain sustainable over the years.
As regards the comparability of vocational education and training systems in Member States, the priorities must be to break down barriers, increase transparency and facilitate comparison within and between the different systems.
As regards the concerns raised in the report about increasing migration pressure in the sensitive area of Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece, these are today's challenges for the European Union and the Member States, which need to find global, pan-European solutions to effectively strengthen their external borders, to strengthen Frontex, to demonstrate due Community solidarity and to support the Member States in the south of Europe where immigrants land.
As regards the current discharge procedure, with respect, in particular, to the other institutions, which is my field, I should like to express my agreement with the steps that have been taken since last year's Spanish Presidency decided, when applying the Treaty of Lisbon, that it was time to bring the necessary transparency and control of the Council's accounts up-to-date too.
As regards the impact of the agreement on oil sands drilling, the agreement must not have the effect of weakening European legislation on the application of the Fuel Quality Directive, nor must it limit the possibility for Canada to regulate drilling of its oil sands in the future under its environmental remit.
As regards the issue of human rights, women's rights and political pluralism, polygamy still exists, even in the South.
As regards the objectives of the CAP in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, the CAP can contribute to the growth of a sustainable economy by responding well to new challenges and taking account of the diversity and richness of agriculture and the specific characteristics of the 27 Member States.
As regards the oil sands issues and your concerns in relation to this negotiation, for the Fuels Quality Directive to fall within the scope of CETA's regulatory cooperation provisions, both parties would need to agree. CETA's regulatory cooperation provisions would not impose any obligation to hold such discussions.
As regards the press reports stating that Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, wants to take an axe to rural development, I would state quite clearly that if the Commission cuts the programmes for rural development then it will be cutting off the lifeblood of rural areas.
As regards the problem of development and humanitarian action, it is true that so much still remains to be done in South Sudan and that we must continue to develop the North and, most importantly, not to isolate it. So much is still to be done because the country has lived purely off oil.
As regards the specific situation in Croatia, it is a transit route through which illicit drugs are smuggled on their way from the producer countries to consumer countries.
As regards the use of antimicrobials as growth promoters in animal feed, I would draw attention to the fact that this endangers the health, not only of the animals, which become resistant to the antibiotics, but also of people, as products of animal origin enter the food chain, thereby affecting humans.
As regards this last aspect, I would remind you that geographical indications are not just a trade policy matter; they are also part of Europe's identity.
As regards, on the other hand, the stability and convergence programmes of the Member States, these should include information on the consistency of the Member States' budgetary objectives with the EU's growth and jobs strategy, and the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee should be consulted during every surveillance procedure.
As required each year, the European Parliament has delivered its opinion on whether or not the Union budget has been properly implemented by the various agencies and institutions who are responsible for it. The allocated sums are earmarked for specific purposes, and the aim of the discharge procedure is to check in retrospect that these purposes have been adhered to. This is an important prerogative of Parliament, as illustrated for example by its influence on the resignation of the Santer Commission in 1999.
As several speakers have said, tomorrow's vote is a very important one, and I believe that it will go well. I hope that, at the end of this week and through the following week, the European Council will be able to have a serious discussion about what we can do to reach an agreement.
As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I am very satisfied with the final document.
As shadow rapporteur for the Hirsch report on European cooperation in vocational education and training, I would like to explain why I voted in favour of adopting this report.
As shadow rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and as I have therefore followed this subject particularly closely, I feel I must congratulate Mrs Jordan Cizelj on the invaluable work she has done.
As shadow rapporteur for this measure for the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists & Democrats in the European Parliament, I am pleased to see that the rapporteur, Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, has welcomed our amendments.
As shadow rapporteur on this dossier, I voted resolutely in favour of this resolution and this agreement to allow Croatia to participate in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, as well as in the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction (REITOX). I therefore fully support Croatia's participation so that it can play an active part in combating this problem, the scale and devastating effects of which are dangerously on the increase in Europe.
As shadow rapporteur, I have tabled an amendment on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left concerning origin labelling, mandatory labelling of animal products and ethical and environmental labelling.
As some countries are affected by storage sites of this kind which are close to their borders, it is important for us to establish certain principles and for the Commission to propose some fundamental regulations, so that public participation is taken seriously and is based on common principles.
As some of my fellow Members have pointed out, if these points were to be clarified, the Commission would be well advised to consult the European Parliament when issuing a mandate.
As someone who represents a very cross-border constituency and who hails from the only region in France to share a border with three other EU Member States, I am very sensitive to these problems and this directive represents a major step forward.
As someone who, for many years, worked as a journalist and has a thorough knowledge of the job, this matter is of particular importance to me. In Azerbaijan, journalists are constantly hindered from fulfilling their basic role - the reliable and credible provision of information.
As something essential to social development and combating poverty, early years learning should be founded on the guarantee of a pre-school network that is public, free, high quality and accessible to all.
As stated by the rapporteur, Mr Manders, the Commission will also evaluate the link between allergies and chemicals used in textile products.
As stated in the resolution, even though Europe must continue giving priority to the international trading system, that is, the Doha Development Round negotiations, the current negotiations with Canada can usefully complement this international approach with a bilateral approach, which is equally necessary.
As stated on a number of occasions, since 2006 the EGF has provided practical support to European workers made redundant either for reasons associated with the relocation of their companies or, following the 2009 amendment, on account of the economic crisis, in order to facilitate their reintegration into the labour market.
As stressed in the report, the EU is Canada's second most important trade partner.
As such, I believe in the power that certain cultural initiatives can have on relations within the Union, as well as diplomatic relations with third countries.
As such, I call on all those involved in the trialogues to properly weigh up the need to protect legitimate expectations and the correct application of the Treaty of Lisbon, paying particular attention to the articles relating to the re-examination and withdrawal of authorisation.
As such, I consider it essential to apply measures to reduce early school drop-out rates, to increase the number of graduates, and to make education and professional training more attractive.
As such, I voted for this joint motion for a resolution, adopted by a broad majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as it is a very balanced text whose proposals not only protect human health and defend animal welfare, but also ensure companies' viability.
As such, I voted for this report, as I believe it is important for the European Union to implement a systematic approach in order to measure social welfare in all its aspects, giving particular emphasis to economic and environmental factors, and to improving quality of life in the medium and long term. I believe that the aforementioned indicators will take on a strategic importance in the definition of future cohesion policy, thereby contributing to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, in line with the principles enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy.
As such, I welcome the adoption of the draft agreement on the creation of a 'transparency register', and I am certain that it will constitute a significant step forward in the European institutions' transparency and will contribute to consolidating the European project among the public.
As such, I welcome the conclusions of the Commission's review, and I am very pleased to see the new proposals aiming to improve access to finance and markets, and to move forward with the process of cutting red tape.
As such, a realistic foreign policy assessment becomes crucial, including more muscular intervention by EU forces, rather than leaving military intervention solely in the hands of France and the United Kingdom.
As such, an agreement is being concluded between Greece, Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which share this natural space, so as to establish cooperation on managing the waters of these lakes to prevent, control and reduce their pollution; to protect and conserve the area's biodiversity and protect its soil from erosion; to promote the sensible use of natural resources and sustainable development; to prevent the introduction of alien animal and plant species; and to regulate human activities with a negative impact on the area. I am convinced of the need to increase cooperation between the involved parties, always on the basis of respect for the principle of equality, of territorial integrity and of mutual benefit, so as to protect this area of exceptional value. I am therefore voting for this agreement.
As such, and following Parliament's adoption of various resolutions reinforcing this idea, in this own-initiative report, the rapporteur asks the Commission to introduce two instruments - a European Order for the Preservation of Assets (EOPA) and a European Order for the Disclosure of Assets (EODA) - to be implemented in national law and to concern only cross-border cases.
As such, and given the special place that Sarajevo occupies in European history and culture, I believe awarding it the title of European Capital of Culture 2014 would be justified, even for its symbolic value.
As such, and since the recent rise in oil prices has affected the economic viability of the sector, it is important to adopt emergency measures that will enable European fishers to overcome their difficult economic situation.
As such, any recommendations in the report which concern simplification but do not require the financial regulations to be revised should still be included in the Seventh Framework Programme. I would like to congratulate the Commission on the measures which have already been implemented.
As such, effective measures to combat insecure jobs, falsified invoices, undeclared work and illegal work urgently need to be taken.
As such, instead of proposing a pact for progress and social development founded on solidarity and on genuine policies of economic and social cohesion, as we have been advocating, it calls for a deepening of the Stability and Growth Pact and, now, the Euro-Plus Pact.
As such, instead of proposing a pact for progress and social development founded on solidarity and on genuine policies of economic and social cohesion, it calls for a deepening of the Stability and Growth Pact and the Euro-Plus Pact.
As such, it is a good opportunity for us to improve the already existing agreement.
As such, it is essential to continue offering them conditions to be able to develop and become secure in the market, by guaranteeing them access to finance and to the potential benefits of the Single Market.
As such, it is important that the EU use the fisheries agreements it establishes to ensure best practices are followed in other countries, fully respecting the key principles of the common fisheries policy (CFP).
As such, it is necessary to strengthen trade relations between the EU and Japan by focusing on the removal of non-tariff barriers to trade and investment, including numerous restrictive rules and regulatory measures for EU companies in accessing the Japanese market.
As such, it is not surprising that it is proposed that this system should also help establish the Single European Sky, for instance; we would like to distance ourselves from this aspect of the report.
As such, it needs to increase its role in all the multilateral organisations and, in particular, the United Nations (UN), where its role must be increasingly active following the launch of the European External Action Service (EEAS). Given that global partnerships are instrumental in achieving jointly identified global goals; that the EU is the world's largest provider of development aid and a major partner of the UN in its efforts across all three pillars of its work, including in crisis and post-crisis situations; and that Member States' contribution amounts to 38% of the UN's regular budget, we believe a solid and stable EU-UN partnership is fundamental to the work of the UN and key to the EU's role as a global player.
As such, it needs to strengthen its role in all multilateral organisations, in particular, the United Nations (UN), where its role must be increasingly active now that the European External Action Service (EEAS) is operational.
As such, its aim is to create a full picture of when, where, how and on which animals the antimicrobials are actually used today, without creating additional financial or administrative burdens for farmers or other animal owners, taking into account the fact that farming practice and intensity is different from one Member State to another.
As such, the MFF needs to have the financial backing to match the ambition and commitment of the Europe 2020 strategy.
As such, the mid-term review of the current framework programme is crucial so that throughout the second half of its existence, it can contribute effectively to the European economy's recovery.
As such, there is a need to find solutions enabling us to prevent legal uncertainty during the transitional period, but without risking the objectives guiding Union action.
As such, there is a need to strengthen and review the current systems, which have been shown to be inadequate, with particular emphasis on mechanisms of control and supervision.
As such, there is a need to strike a balance between these institutions' freedom to conduct their business, in what is an essentially private matter, and the economic impact that another crisis in the financial system could have on the real economy, and for the lives of everyone as members of a community.
As such, we are able to consider it acceptable to take into account other indicators that might complement these shortcomings so as to make social progress measures as complete, credible and close to reality as possible.
As such, we should promote the areas that contribute most to competitiveness, like research, innovation and energy.
As such, we would like to reiterate our opposition to it, with the arguments to back this up: we are talking about the defence, through various means including soldiers and diplomats, of the European powers' economic and geostrategic interests, in collaboration with the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). We must remember the track record of these institutions and their tragic consequences: Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans and Libya, and other countries that are also on the list.
As such, while they do not replace the decision of whether or not to adopt a given solution, they can be decisive in shaping the choice of a given political solution.
As the Americans say, we must put our money where our mouth is and not make commitments which we then fail to fulfil.
As the Commissioner said, I think there are no differences between us so great that we cannot overcome them. I am appealing for unity, therefore.
As the Conservative-led government in the United Kingdom has shelved legislation on transparency introduced by the previous Labour Government, I welcome the inclusion of my proposal to introduce such a requirement at the EU level.
As the Court of Auditors has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, and as a delegation from the Committee on Fisheries visited the CFCA in June 2010 and was very satisfied with the general state of its affairs, particularly the execution of the Joint Deployment Plans, I believe Parliament should adopt this report.
As the EU is an undemocratic institution itself, and one that I strongly believe should not have a foreign policy agenda, I cannot endorse any third country activity by it. The UK is one of the world's largest donors of foreign aid.
As the European Union is a major player in international fisheries and one of the main global markets for fishery products, the rapporteur proposes that Parliament gives its consent to the conclusion of the Agreement and firmly supports and encourages the European Commission to continue to push for the adoption of these proposals. I voted 'in favour'.
As the European Union is one of the main representatives of international fisheries and one of the main global markets for fishery products, it is suitable and appropriate to promote the adoption of such proposals by the European institutions, too.
As the French winner of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences, Maurice Allais, pointed out, free trade is only mutually beneficial if it is between countries with comparable levels of development, and further to that, I would add, if it is in targeted areas with the strategic sectors of each country remaining protected.
As the Human Rights Consultations advising President Medvedev have called for an essential renovation of the national house from basement to roof, our Parliament is coming not with empty appeasement but with constructive provision of cooperation.
As the Internet is a global meeting place, the EU should develop specific policies to promote European culture.
As the Treaty of Lisbon has increased the range of Parliament's powers with respect to the conclusion of international agreements, it is necessary, in the process of redefining its status, to offer new forms of legal framework for its action.
As the Vice-Chair of the Delegation to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I believe we also need to establish a common strategy with the ACP countries for the fight against illegal imports of toxic waste to these countries, and in particular action plans for introducing a system for the safe management of waste in African countries, including support for recycling technology.
As the city, which wishes to turn its back on the past and looks forward enthusiastically to its future in Europe, will be marking several important anniversaries in 2014, I should like to see Sarajevo designated as the European Capital of Culture for that year.
As the current directive on misleading practices has turned out to be insufficient, I voted in favour of this resolution calling on the European Commission to speed up the revision of this directive so that such misleading practices can no longer take place.
As the elected representative of a port town, it is all the more incumbent on me to call on the Commission to authorise an increase in the ceiling of the de minimis aid.
As the expansion of renewable energies does indeed represent one of the focal points of the Europe 2020 strategy, I assume that, in the forthcoming period, there will definitively be a higher budget for this area, including from the regional policy heading.
As the final text is still being negotiated with the Council, the European Parliament's report proposes to identify issues such as the origin marking of textile products imported to the EU, according to which it would be compulsory for the label to indicate not only the manufacturer of the end product, but the country of origin of the imported textile products used to manufacture it, as is already done in Canada, the US, China and Japan.
As the joint motion for a resolution quite rightly says, both sides need to present concrete plans on the setting-up and/or reform of their institutions so that the two States are completely independent, to cease hostilities, and to promote democratic governance in order to establish long-term peace and security in the area.
As the largest market for such products, the European Union should therefore support measures aimed at preventing violations of fisheries legislation.
As the leader of my team said to me, it is the first time that they have ever discussed a constitution - words and arguments they have never known before.
As the past year has shown, the so-called Stability and Growth Pact, which was intended to provide an effective deterrent against violations of the macroeconomic principles of the euro area by the Member States, has not been terribly effective, to put it mildly.
As the primary role of the IMF is to work on conditional structural reform packages to accompany the distribution of funds to members when they are in dire straits, I believe that Ms Lagarde has shown that she is well able to broker complex agreements on controversial issues, successfully bringing together disparate parties to reach a beneficial solution.
As the protocol to the current Fisheries Partnership Agreement will expire in the future, the Commission's intention to open renewal negotiations with the other party is logical.
As the purpose of these trade preferences is to try to support Pakistan's recovery and future development, we believe that they should be offensive and far-reaching without safeguard measures for the EU, particularly as they are to be for a limited time only.
As the rapporteur - who subscribes to this - points out, 'labour standards should not be used for protectionist trade purposes' according to the international bodies! So then, what principles, what values, what considerations could ever challenge the absolute power of the market? You talk a lot about the social responsibility of companies who, after all, are only playing by the rules that you have put in place.
As the rapporteur clearly states, the intention of creating a full Open Aviation Area between these two countries, an issue with which we have raised significant concerns, does not fall within the scope of this Agreement, but should be the subject of a separate recommendation.
As the rapporteur for the future of structural policy, I would also say that European cohesion policy should also be included here.
As the rapporteur mentioned it, we would also stress the need to study and assess the best ways to increase destination countries' capacities for absorbing EDF aid, which immediately means the profound involvement of both governments and peoples in outlining and implementing programmes, and in setting priorities.
As the rapporteur quite rightly points out, the accession of Bulgaria to the Schengen Agreement should be followed by a special plan to combat illegal immigration.
As the rapporteur writes, European Union assistance is essential if the Member States are to be in a position to meet future challenges.
As the report argues, our ultimate goal is to improve the information available to prospective students and others on various aspects of institutions' activities and performance.
As the report explains, the EU enjoys a good worldwide reputation in terms of the ideal link between economic dynamism and a social model, which also gives rise to a certain responsibility.
As the report shows, the low levels of success achieved to date, lack of coordination with regard to shared objectives (World Health Organisation), and lack of clear indications as to how such objectives should be achieved make it necessary, in my view as well, to introduce a new financing instrument for development cooperation.
As the second largest trading partner, the EU is clearly intended to be established as a counterbalance to the US market and, conversely, as far as Europe is concerned, Canada represents a gateway to the NAFTA economic area.
As the shadow rapporteur for my group in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, the social situation and the conditions in which creative artists in Europe live are particularly important.
As the shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), I believe that we must include regional and local authorities in the preparation and implementation of partnerships, and move towards a thematic concentration of priorities and financial resources to be allocated in the future.
As the various other possible modules are at different stages of methodological maturity, including, for instance, timber and fish as well as unused extraction, a modular structure has been adopted for the regulation with a view to possibly introducing new modules as annexes to the core text in the future.
As these are exceptional preferences that are not compatible with the positive or negative non-discrimination rule of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), it is necessary to obtain a WTO waiver before awarding these trade preferences.
As they both said, research and innovation is important for the future of the European economy. I certainly know that there are many universities in Wales, for example, which will take advantage of European funding.
As this motion for a resolution clearly meets these requirements, I have voted in favour of it. Now it is important for the parties to the Comprehensive Peace Agreement to engage in a continued and constructive dialogue to address the issues which remain unresolved after the referendum.
As this report fails to offer any reversal of the trend, I decided to abstain.
As this resolution today illustrates in graphic detail, Lukashenko has intensified his campaign for persecution and harassment against those who dare challenge his iron-fisted rule.
As to the Dublin Regulation and the Eurodac Regulation, important progress has been made at technical level.
As transatlantic relations are primarily based on a set of common values, I hope that the American authorities will be more receptive to the EU's commitment to dropping the death penalty worldwide.
As usual, on the pretext of sorting out problems that you have caused yourselves, you are imposing on us more Europe and more Commission power: this Commission that is little more than a handful of civil servants appointed with no democratic oversight, but that has been set up as a censor and slave-driver that will have the right to impose sanctions on Member States.
As usual, the interests of the large economic and financial groups in Europe are at the fore in this resolution.
As usual, the law-abiding will bear the brunt of the red tape, and wrongdoers will just find a way of carrying on. While taxpayers' money sloshes around Brussels in the quantities that it does, there will always be unscrupulous lobbyists, just as where there is carrion, there are always vultures.
As was mentioned this morning, the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe, whom I very much admire, Mr Thomas Hammarberg, explained to us that this is not a closed story, that it is still going on, and that he would very much wish for Parliament to cooperate with the Council of Europe on this important issue.
As we all know, it is the nuclear lobby that has succeeded in recent years in promoting nuclear power as a climate-friendly alternative.
As we all know, nobody is perfect in this world, but it is in accordance with Europe's political standards and norms, and also in accordance with the logic and values of democracy, that we expect the Ukrainian authorities not to abuse their power by encouraging and holding politically motivated trials, and instead to give those who are suspects a fair trial, rather than political retribution.
As we all know, the economy of Seychelles relies essentially on tourism and fisheries; in fact, the fishing industry accounts for 15% of its GDP and employs 17% of the working population. I believe that the negotiations conducted by the European Commission, which permitted the extension of the protocol to the Partnership Agreement, have produced the draft of a document which is mutually advantageous in that it strengthens the level of cooperation between the EU and Seychelles, and promotes a partnership in which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy in Seychelles and responsible exploitation of fishery resources in the Seychelles' fishing zone.
As we approach a new stage of EU enlargement, the MFF must provide for properly balanced expenditure.
As we are all aware, in the case of Portugal, it is extremely important to put the economy on a higher growth path in the medium term and to strengthen competitiveness.
As we come into the autumn, we need a serious examination, and we have put down some 60 questions to the Commission on this matter, with the aim of identifying where we are getting poor implementation.
As we continue to cooperate with the affected countries, my greatest wish is that we should establish workshops for future technology there, and provide advice on how to save energy and develop alternative energy sources.
As we emphasise in the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, the overarching objective of the 'Innovation Union' must be long-term development and competitiveness based on technology, knowledge and the development of education.
As we feared, the tight vote against us in the Committee on International Trade on the crucial Article 5 (review of Member States' existing bilateral investment treaties (BITs)) and Article 6 (the possibility of withdrawing authorisation for a BIT) of Carl Schlyter's report on 'Transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries' has been confirmed by the vote in plenary.
As we have already said more than once, the tragedy Pakistan has suffered requires European solidarity.
As we have heard, the UK nuclear inspector, Dr Mike Weightman, published his interim report even before the stress tests had been agreed.
As we have said regarding the application of a global European satellite navigation system for transport, the use of this technology could represent an important contribution to the development, modernisation and diversification of public services, in the creation of opportunities for cooperation, and progress in science and its applications, and in the exchange and accessibility of information, with the guarantee of respect for the public's rights, freedoms and guarantees.
As we have seen in practice, and as various speakers have pointed out, last year's stress tests did not achieve their objective of highlighting which banks enjoy the necessary confidence of their consumers, their creditors and the national regulatory authorities.
As we have storage facilities which are close to borders, we cannot simply say that this is where the border is and the issue has nothing to do with the other citizens.
As we know, although displaced inhabitants always leave very quickly, their return takes time and is all too often a source of considerable humanitarian and social problems. I therefore propose that the European Union should organise a monitoring mission as quickly as possible, along the lines of the work we did in the Balkans.
As we know, every debate on discharge has its own particular context, and the context of today's debate is the economic and financial crisis, which has caused financial and budgetary problems for a number of Member States.
As we know, financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control, carried out by the European Court of Auditors; and a discharge procedure carried out by the European Parliament.
As we know, since the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has had the right to be informed on all stages of negotiation for international agreements.
As we know, the devil is in the detail, so we would like to know the following, Commissioner: what are the specific subjects of the negotiations when it comes to public invitations to tender in the services sector or in connection with labour migration? What text is on the table with regard to intellectual property rights? What is the situation with regard to the environment and agriculture? By using the specific texts, we want to examine whether the role of India as the pharmacy to the world's poor is put at risk or whether the production of cheaper malaria medicines or medicines for the treatment of AIDS will be obstructed by the agreement, without ignoring the massive research investments also made by our own pharmaceutical companies.
As we know, this report on the exceptional trade preferences conceded to Pakistan originated with a European Council decision, which mandated the Commission to make a proposal to Parliament and to the Council.
As we remember from the post-election protests in December last year, Lukashenko is intolerant of dissent and seems to take pleasure in using violence and intimidation against pro-democracy activists.
As we said during the debate, another issue that was not tackled sufficiently was the risk - very clear from the results of the European Innovation Panel of 2009 - of an 'innovation divide' between the countries and regions that innovate most and the rest.
As we see it, there is room for improvement in other areas that this Parliament considers important - such as road safety.
As we speak, the G20 in Paris is beginning discussions on regulating the global commodities markets, with particular reference to agricultural commodities.
As we well know, the main result of research is knowledge, followed by the opportunity to enhance that result in the economic sector, or indeed the industrial sector. A clear distinction must be made, then, between the manipulation and the enhancement of fundamental research.
As we work on formulating a proper European investment policy therefore, I felt it would be beneficial to vote in favour of obliging Member States to make provision, when renegotiating bilateral treaties or negotiating new treaties, for a dispute settlement mechanism in which the Commission would be allowed to participate, even in a purely advisory capacity, and for confidentiality requirements to be lifted in order to allow the EU's executive body to take part in such a capacity.
As well as an increase in competition, these measures include greater and judicious use of internal credit ratings, particularly by large financial institutions that are capable of performing their own risk assessments.
As well as any tax measures that could be adopted at Member State level, EU-level solutions are needed so as not to exacerbate the inequalities that already exist today between Member States and which are increasing because of the serious social and economic crisis, which is hitting the most vulnerable economies particularly hard.
As well as early years education, it targets, firstly, the reduction of school drop-out rates and, secondly, increasing the number of graduates.
As well as extending the concept to several areas and incorporating this CSA dimension into our trade polices, why not one day make it binding? Over and above political signalling, this would be a real step forward in achieving our social policy objectives.
As well as social standards, corporate social responsibility should contribute to sustainable growth, but companies should not avoid dialogue with employees and they must respect and promote decent employment relations, encourage employee participation through consultation and information and through collective bargaining, develop vocational skills and lifelong learning, comply with work safety standards, promote equality of men and women, create a proper environment for social partners to anticipate and manage changes that have taken place in the labour market, including restructuring, improve the quality of work, and integrate and protect vulnerable groups of workers, such as young people, the elderly, disabled people and migrants.
As well as that infamous underfunding there is a deadlock of funds for countries that could benefit from the Industrialised Countries Instrument (ICI+) but - and I shall finish now, Mr President - are unable to do so because there is no solution to the problem of the legal basis for this instrument.
As well as this, there is a clear link between a poor and disadvantaged background and low educational achievement.
As with Mr Lyon's report one year ago and Mr Garriga Polledo's report on the financial perspectives last month, tomorrow we will be voting in favour of maintaining the agricultural budget for the 2014-2020 programming period. I am sure that it will be a close-run thing, but we do need to take a stand and to make choices, because we will not have the money to do everything ...
As with other cases, there remain concerns about the effectiveness of the development cooperation objectives...
As yet there are no test criteria, even though judgments have already been made - judgments that the stress tests are too soft, disappointing or inadequate.
As yet, the Canadian Government believes this directive discriminates between Canadian oil imports and oil imports from other countries. I consider the agreement to be too early.
As you all know, however, I was very critical of the original Commission initiative, and I would therefore like to emphasise several points which we have managed to include in this report.
As you all know, the EU headline targets under Europe 2020 include increasing the employment rate to 75%, lifting at least 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion, reducing the proportion of early school-leavers to under 10%, and ensuring that at least 40% of the younger generation will have completed a tertiary degree by 2020.
As you all know, the negotiations with the Council in the following months called for flexibility from all sides to identify workable solutions for the institutions.
As you are aware, the agencies' functioning and governance are currently being discussed within the interinstitutional working group involving the Commission, Parliament and the Council, on the basis, inter alia, of a multi-agency evaluation carried out for the Commission in 2009.
As you frequently remind us, common foreign policy must fulfil the global objectives of the European Union which are defined, in particular, in Article 3 of the Treaty, and where the elimination of poverty features prominently.
As you know, 1 May 2011 was an important date for the EU. It marked the end of restrictions on the right to work of citizens from the eight Member States which joined in 2004, who can now work freely in any Member State.
As you know, EU agencies are legally autonomous bodies whose governance rules are laid down in the funding regulations.
As you know, imports do not of course come into the CAP, but they make up another essential piece of the jigsaw that should go alongside the CAP, because if we import cheap, poor-quality products our agriculture is bound to collapse.
As you know, our transatlantic relations are based on values that we have shared for a long time, such as universal human rights and the right to a fair trial.
As you know, since March 2009, all Member States as well as Switzerland have agreed to implement the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) standard which stipulates that a State cannot refuse to provide information if so requested by another State, on the grounds that this information is held by a bank or any other financial institution.
As you know, the Council and Parliament are now negotiating to have the resettlement programme in place, and this is also an area where the European Commission could look at possibilities for financing quite a lot of it. In relation to our immediate neighbourhood across the Mediterranean, in the mobility partnerships: we are looking to include all aspects of irregular, legal and international protection asylum under migration.
As you know, the ESF is implemented through shared management, and I believe that the management system of the current ESF is not compatible with the objectives of the EGF.
As you know, the European Union as such does not have all those resources, so we need the cooperation of the Member States in making them available.
As you know, the evaluation of this liquidity risk is not part of the stress test itself, the results of which will be made public.
As you know, the previous EU-Japan Summit of April last year established a joint high-level group composed of senior officials to identify options for the comprehensive strengthening of all aspects of the EU-Japan relationship, in the political, economic and sectoral cooperation fields.
As you know, the transport sector plays a key role in guaranteeing mobility and socio-economic development in Europe and, in order to address the challenges of economic growth and sustainability, it is necessary to improve transport sector infrastructure.
As you know, there have been intensive negotiations on the Frontex Amending Regulation.
As you know, this was the view of the committee expressed on Tuesday, and we think that we can now proceed to have further discussions with the Council with a view to achieving a satisfactory outcome.
As you know, we are working, honourable Members, on a legislative framework on the management of the crisis, the banking resolution, which we have had the opportunity to discuss several times.
As you mentioned, I am a co-chair of this working group that we have in place. I cannot say much about what we are discussing in detail. I can assure you, however, that we will ensure that the rules of conduct for this Parliament will be some of the most transparent and will be rules which can make our citizens and ourselves proud of being members of this extraordinary institution.
As you mentioned, Madam Vice-President/High Representative, you doubt that a new initiative of this kind would end in a more positive way. I would like to ask if you can update us on actual humanitarian needs in Gaza, as well as on the goods and support currently channelled through the existing crossing points from Israel and Egypt.
As you noted, however, this scenario does not extend to cases in which repayment of sovereign debt is defaulted on. This is because the shock envisaged by the EBA would only have an impact on sovereign debts held in the banks' trading book.
As you said yourself, anything that breaches the European Treaties can also be clarified in a court of law.
As you said, last year's stress test was clearly insufficient, and the Commission itself has said this on numerous occasions to the new supervisory authority, the European Banking Authority (EBA), which coordinates the test in cooperation with national supervisory bodies.
As you well know, Parliament and the Council have to assess it at second reading, but the European Commission intends to seize back the policy initiative and reinvigorate it. In other words, the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship intends to start work immediately on ensuring the protection of our products, for the sake of the competitiveness of our businesses and the health of our citizens.
As young people express their anxieties on the streets of Athens and Madrid, as 500 million Europeans are wondering what their future holds, it is time to ask the right questions and to come up with responses to the issues that we face.
Aside from what has already been said about the precautionary principle and essential traceability - the first point - it is also a question of knowing how this general alert singling out Spanish cucumbers for blame could have been issued without any, or hardly any, proof.
Aspirations are high and expectations too that the revolutions will have been worth the blood that has been spilt, worth the turmoil and fear, worth the economic havoc in a world already grappling with the worst economic problems for decades.
Assertive and successful legislation requires not just good political debate and a joint effort leading to cooperation and consensus, but also a trustworthy technical basis that guides the legislative entities by assessing the context and consequences of the policies in question.
Assessing an agreement requires criteria based on strict scrutiny and monitoring of the terms of negotiation. I hope that the Commission and Parliament can cooperate actively so as to continually improve the quality and rigour of this type of agreement.
Assistance must also be allocated in a targeted manner, i.e. linked to climate change.
At European and Member State level, there have been many initiatives to fill the gaps in these areas.
At Internal Market level, the effects are negative for the production of European countries like Portugal.
At a European level, it is also important to have factual and objective information from Croatia concerning drugs and drug addiction and their consequences, and, at the same time, the Republic of Croatia can get information on best practices to understand the nature of its drug problems and better respond to them.
At a conference in Tunisia, organised by the Party of European Socialists, attended by representatives of parties and movements from the whole region, we asked the European Union for an emergency programme which will support the democratic processes now, immediately.
At a critical juncture for the European project, I consider the involvement of all the European and national authorities essential, in order for the necessary measures to be taken early.
At a particularly complicated time for Europe, Mr Draghi will certainly be capable of responding to the needs of the European financial system and guaranteeing financial stability and support for economic growth.
At a time of budget austerity, which is a direct consequence of the global crisis that has hit the European labour market hard, we need to consider our strategies for growth and employment, especially for young people, without losing sight of national differences and needs.
At a time of economic and financial crisis, the European Union is being called upon to enhance its strategic autonomy in order to uphold its values, and protect its citizens by developing a shared vision of the main challenges and threats and by aligning its resources and capabilities to adequately respond to them. I think that the new provisions on the common security and defence policy introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon offer a strong political statement of the Union's intention to act as a force for stability in the world.
At a time of economic crisis, when some Member States are reducing investment in education and training, I am pleased that Parliament has today adopted the report on Youth on the Move.
At a time of great economic difficulty such as we are experiencing now, the only purpose of this decision to strike at an economic sector that underpins our market is to make money, even if hardly any of this money is then used for transport infrastructure.
At a time of savage economic and financial crisis, in which there is little aid available to sustain companies and jobs, I welcome the proposal made in this resolution by my colleagues from the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) to support EU fishers by increasing the ceiling for de minimis aid from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per company for a three-year period.
At a time of such acute crisis as this, solidarity should not merely be a political priority, but above all an imperative of conscience. I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to submit legislative proposals to correct this unjust situation.
At a time of widespread economic crisis such as we are experiencing now, the need for effective enforcement of budgetary surveillance in the euro area is a priority.
At a time such as this, when the economic and financial crisis demands more cautious spending, transparency and secure and innovative finance, in the face of ever scarcer resources and ever more acute social needs, to try to make more efficient use of the Structural Funds is not only an objective but also a moral duty for all administrators and, above all, for this Europe, which is perceived by its citizens as an entity that is becoming increasingly abstract and out of touch with people's real needs.
At a time when Europe is experiencing an unprecedented economic, financial and social crisis, which is particularly affecting certain regions that were already weaker, it is vital for the future that cohesion policy continue to play its fundamental role in balanced and sustainable development.
At a time when Member States are being asked to slash their own budgets drastically, when people are being summoned to tighten their belts, when social security systems are being undermined by unemployment and immigration, while those responsible for the crisis continue to line their pockets and markets continue to speculate, it is obscene for this assembly, in cahoots with Brussels, to demand a single cent more to pursue these policies and make them worse.
At a time when citizens are increasingly losing faith in the EU, when Greece is on its knees and the rating agencies are dictating to States, Parliament should stop this dogmatic insistence on austerity at all costs.
At a time when countries like Portugal are resorting to aid from the other Member States, and when Europe is, as such, facing a serious economic and financial crisis that threatens its stability, an even greater effort should be made to avoid cost overruns and excessive expense.
At a time when many Member States are faced with difficult fiscal adjustments, the EU budget, 95% of which is used for investment, must provide a very high level of European added value.
At a time when more and more people are talking about a crisis of trust in the European Union, the fact that the overwhelming majority of MEPs support the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs should be seen as confirmation that the idea of European integration still continues to be relevant.
At a time when our government is having to make cuts and reduce the level of public spending, and governments across the EU are having to do exactly the same thing, why is it, first of all, that the EU is asking for more money for its budgets and its financial perspective, and secondly that it cannot spend the money it has efficiently?
At a time when some governments are daring to suggest the reestablishment of checks at internal borders, it is even more important to demonstrate our support for the extension of what is, today, one of the European Union's best achievements.
At a time when the Commission, and indeed this Parliament, ought to be searching for, and bringing forward, proposals on how to save money, we are offered this report which suggests the completion of the Galileo satellite navigation system at an additional cost of EUR 1.9 billion in the next Multiannual Financial Framework.
At a time when the EU Member States are fighting massive budget deficits and growing national debt, the European Parliament is choosing to demand more money for the EU. This is a line that we cannot support.
At a time when the EU Member States find themselves under serious budgetary pressure, I am disappointed to see that, instead of setting priorities, the European Parliament is choosing to increase the budget by at least 5%. The European Parliament voted for contributions to continue in areas that keep the European economy locked in its old ways, by, among other things, setting aside amounts for the common agricultural policy that are at least as large as for the 2013 budget year. I am also opposed to the European Parliament's proposal to reform the EU's financing by introducing an own resources system.
At a time when the EU has already understood that greater coordination of economic policy and greater control of budgetary policy are both necessary, the idea that the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) should support economic governance seems an extremely relevant one to me.
At a time when the European Union is holding up progress and gender equality as common fundamental values, it is somewhat surprising that these European funds should be involved in a campaign of this nature. I should therefore like to take the opportunity of this debate to question the Commission on the validation of the funding for this campaign by the PROGRESS programme.
At a time when the European economy is weak and competitiveness is more vital than ever, this principle may serve to make freight transport even more expensive, especially for outlying countries, for which the price of transportation is added to the cost of the goods.
At a time when the Front National is riding high in the French polls and when one may question that party's move into the mainstream (in both media and political terms), I am satisfied that the European Parliament will not defend Mr Gollnisch's parliamentary immunity and have called for it to be lifted so that the courts can do their job.
At a time when the future common fisheries policy appears to be taking shape, I believe that our fishermen are not resistant to change; quite the contrary.
At a time when there are no watertight compartments between countries, we need to listen very carefully to the uproar of events.
At a time when threats are becoming increasingly serious, it is vital for us to protect these exceptional natural resources better.
At a time when transactions involving assets and capital are becoming increasingly globalised, it is important that the European Union adopt a common investment policy in line with the strategy set out by all the Member States.
At a time when we are commemorating such a significant anniversary, it is all the more dispiriting for us that, just a few days beforehand, the Hungarian Parliament, and later the President of Hungary, sign a constitution that runs counter to the fundamental principles of democracy.
At a time when we are living through what might be called a crisis of the European idea, it is good to reiterate the European added value that territorial cooperation provides.
At a time when we are striving, in Europe, to achieve a resource-efficient and sustainable economy, this data will allow us to link environmental factors to economic ones and thus offers the possibility of more comprehensive and better-informed policy making.
At a time when young Europeans are some of the main victims of the economic crisis, we should support all initiatives aimed at improving the situation of young people and, in particular, those aimed at improving access to education and their professional situation.
At a time when young people are being hit particularly hard by the effects of the global financial crisis, everything must be done to ensure that they can develop the skills, qualifications and knowledge that will enable them to contribute actively to the growth and sustainable future of the European Union.
At a young age, this should not be seen as an obstacle.
At any rate, I will try to be a little slower if that would make it better.
At first reading, Parliament approved 63 amendments to the Commission proposal on a regulation on textile fibre names and related labelling of textile products.
At first reading, on 18 May 2010, Parliament approved 63 amendments with a large majority.
At first, I was not given adequate support on this issue by the nuclear regulators. I am grateful that Parliament and, in particular, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety were behind me. For this reason, I incorporated their expectations into the negotiations.
At last week's constitutive session of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, representatives from Belarus were rightly missing.
At least 20% of funding under the geographical programmes should go into these life-saving sectors of basic health and basic education.
At long last, support will be allocated in accordance with two criteria: employment - I believe that agricultural policy needs to allow for the notion of providing employment - and, of course, the production of public goods.
At meetings with the Russians, we must speak very firmly about press freedoms in Russia.
At present over 140 nuclear power stations are operating on the territory of the European Union, with over 190 on the European continent. I therefore support the decision to conduct stress tests of nuclear power stations on EU territory.
At present the number of cross-border debts successfully recovered is particularly low, and the cost of cross-border debt recovery can be prohibitive and can deter parties from engaging in legal proceedings.
At present we are seeing time and again in Greece, Portugal and Ireland that, under pressure from the European Commission, in negotiations with the national governments results and packages have been put together in which it is the weakest that suffer, and in which the wealthy - who did very well out of the previous 20 years - are left alone.
At present, 14.4% of young people in Europe aged 18 to 24 years have less than higher secondary level education, and almost 21% of young people are unemployed. I also support the fact that the Youth on the Move initiative aims to ensure education that will meet the needs of the labour market.
At present, I will feel less concerned if the Schengen area's Mediterranean border is guarded as well as Bulgaria and Romania guard their Black Sea borders.
At present, a 'toolbox' is the preferred option because this would meet current needs and special provisions in relation to the most common types of contract would be a genuine aid for consumers.
At present, research into low doses of radiation is the subject of a large-scale initiative as part of a joint programme planned by the European MELODI platform.
At present, there are several options on the table.
At present, two thirds of energy resources are imported from countries outside the EU, mainly Russia.
At present, under the aegis of the 7th Euratom framework programme, we are supporting a network of excellence in radio ecology in order to finance integration, networking and scientific excellence in the interests of radiation protection for human beings and the environment.
At some point, there will be a sort of Oettinger seal of approval on the old reactors which will certify that tests have once again been carried out on paper of all the things that have often been tested before.
At that point, the European Parliament, not unlike the police chief in the film Casablanca, professed itself to be shocked - shocked! - to discover that corrupt lobbying had been taking place under its very nose.
At that time we were very much criticised, but now - unanimously - the governments of Europe have decided to increase the effective lending capacity. I wonder if it would not have been possible to approve it some months ago.
At the 19th EU-Japan Summit in April last year, it was agreed to establish a joint high-level group in order to analyse the progress in EU-Japan relations so far and draw up suggestions for streamlining our current activities.
At the Council meeting on 12 May 2011 the Presidency plans to initiate discussions on the various ideas on the Schengen acquis which have been put forward by the Commission in its communication on migration of 4 May.
At the Council, the High Representative intends to present a comprehensive EU strategic approach for Sudan, mainly focusing on an independent South Sudan, but also including elements for constructive engagement with North Sudan, including the Transitional Areas, Darfur and the East.
At the aforementioned meeting, the Presidency would like the Council to adopt conclusions in which the 'think small first' principle is applied in particular, that is to say, the principle which the Commission's communication is based on.
At the beginning of the year, the European Banking Authority announced that it would be carrying out a separate thematic review of the liquidity risks in the EU banking sector as part of its regular risk assessment cycle in the first quarter of 2011.
At the end of February, I myself presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control the Council's recommendations on the discharge to the Commission for the implementation of the budget. I welcome the fact that many of the points highlighted by the Council have been taken up by your institution as well.
At the end of June 2011, the Commission will present its proposal for the next 7-year budgetary framework (2014-2020). In the case of EU regional policy, there have been substantial problems with absorption capacity under the individual programmes.
At the end of his fruitful existence, Miguel de Cervantes said that there were moments in life when one must choose whether to be a road or an inn.
At the end of this month, the Commission is to publish its proposals for the EU's budget after 2014.
At the end of this year, the Commission is going to present its proposals for the next generation of financing instruments for external action, to cover the post-2013 Multiannual Financial Framework.
At the hearing held in the Economic Affairs Committee last week he stresses that more European economic governance is now necessary and that under his presidency the ECB would keep on focusing primarily on the fight against inflation.
At the initial stage, the environmental accounts to be compiled within the common framework shall be grouped in the following modules: a module for air emissions accounts; a module for environmentally related taxes by economic activities; a module for economy-wide material flow accounts.
At the moment the geological storage of nuclear waste may very generally seem to be the least worst option, but advances in science could potentially turn that conclusion on its head. I therefore welcome the Commissioner's remarks on this.
At the moment, another challenge needs to be included on the agenda for the debate on the Development Cooperation Instrument, namely, the food price crisis, triggered by the drought and speculation on the global food market.
At the moment, less than 100 km from the European Union's external border, near St Petersburg, a nuclear power plant with a Chernobyl-type reactor is still in operation.
At the moment, many shops do not send goods to all EU Member States, and our transactions are often terminated.
At the moment, six of the seven candidates who stood against President Lukashenko are still being tried and harassed.
At the moment, the unity of intent of which so much has been said seems to have been thwarted by the rightful aspirations of the Member States to retain their prerogatives in the area of security policy. I do not agree with the idea of calling for a larger budget for this policy without there being real agreement among national governments on the use of these funds.
At the moment, there are growing expectations that in the foreseeable future, over the next few decades, developments during the next or next-but-one generation of science will enable us to recycle or store waste more effectively than we can today.
At the moment, there is the case of Syria in the United Nations Security Council.
At the moment, this mechanism does not actually fall under the discharge, nor does it fall under the declaration of assurance of the Court of Auditors.
At the moment, we are pointing our fingers at Germany, but perhaps it will soon be our own Member States we are pointing at. We therefore need to ask whether the internal monitoring systems in all the Member States are strong enough.
At the moment, we know that eight people have died, among them two pregnant women and a twelve year-old boy, more than 250 have been injured and 80% of houses are affected.
At the policy level, specific objectives and road maps have been set in recent policy documents.
At the present juncture, financial stability is being safeguarded by the EU-IMF stability mechanisms and especially by the actions that the Member States - especially the vulnerable Member States - are themselves taking.
At the present time, attention is mainly paid to implementation of the EU Action Plan for 2009-2012, which is aimed at strengthening European cooperation in the struggle against the unacceptable consequences of drug addiction. I would like to see the Centre working not only on the consequences but also on the causes of drug addiction, thus solving the problem at an early stage. I voted in favour.
At the present time, only six Member States have bilateral agreements on certification of aviation services.
At the present time, we must not forget young people.
At the same time - and Olli Rehn will have the opportunity to address you later this afternoon - we will make a strong appeal to you and to the Council to see if it is possible to come to a final agreement.
At the same time - and this was also an important issue for the European Parliament - there is clarity about the transparency requirement.
At the same time we must not fail to obtain adequate financing for Europe's strategic policies and action priorities, which are indispensable for a true relaunch of the Union and for the 500 million European citizens.
At the same time, 15% of the fees collected must be invested in pan-European transport networks: not just road transport, but also rail and inland waterway transport.
At the same time, European Union countries must also be aware that it is in their interest for Romania and Bulgaria to join Schengen because they will be able to make their own contribution to the security of all Member States and extend the Schengen area, which is set to strengthen the integration process within the European Union and the common area of freedom, security and justice.
At the same time, GNSS is part of the EU 2020 strategy's key innovation objectives. A larger amount of annual funding than is allocated at the moment needs to be provided so that this global navigation system is implemented in a suitable, uniform manner in all EU Member States.
At the same time, I call on the European Commission to propose active measures through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) in order to support women's employment in rural areas.
At the same time, I feel there is a need to strengthen dialogue between SMEs and public procurement bodies in order to simplify the involvement of SMEs in public procurement procedures. I would consider it appropriate in these circumstances to examine the options for helping SMEs to create partnerships and consortia, and to participate jointly in public contracts.
At the same time, I tabled an amendment to this report, along with other fellow Members, in which I expressed my disagreement about funding the innovation policy with money hitherto earmarked for the common agricultural policy.
At the same time, I think that we need new business models which will support these industries, by leveraging the benefits offered by the single digital market.
At the same time, I think we should call on the Member States to implement the JESSICA initiative at the level of cities, and not of regions or states.
At the same time, I welcome the positive attitude shown by the Croatian authorities to the use of the monitoring mechanism up until the actual time of accession as an additional incentive.
At the same time, I wish to point out that it is also clear in the economic policy programme compiled by the Troika in relation to Portugal that the programmes devised for Greece, Ireland and Portugal alike adapt to the characteristics of each country and are not formulaic in any way.
At the same time, I would like to commend the proposal to maintain a high level of funding for cohesion policy.
At the same time, I would like to emphasise that Poland is Canada's largest trading partner among the Central and Eastern European countries and, for a dozen or so years, has maintained a bilateral trade surplus which has grown year on year.
At the same time, I would like to emphasise that the EU ought to have an attitude of restraint and provide these resources by means of redistribution within the existing EU budget. I do not believe that the overall size of the budget should increase. I would prefer to see the agricultural budget reduced in favour of the priorities of research and development and the conversion to green energy, etc. set in the Europe 2020 strategy.
At the same time, I would like to stress that maintaining the diversity of the European Union's regions in the field of innovation requires particular attention to be paid to the formulation of a common strategic financial framework for scientific research and innovation.
At the same time, a Member State has the right to exempt vehicles under 12 tonnes, an option which I hope Estonia will use.
At the same time, approximately 300 000 SMEs have managed to access funding under the competitiveness and innovation programme.
At the same time, bilateral agreements such as the one being analysed at present are specific mechanisms that can help achieve the mentioned objectives. I voted in favour of this resolution on trade relations between the EU and Japan as I am convinced that the EU-Japan Free Trade Agreement (FTA) has the potential to benefit both economies.
At the same time, biodiversity conservation, protection against natural disasters and CO2 capture from the atmosphere are crucial to improving our citizens' quality of life and to preserving the environment. I therefore think that protection of the forests in the EU must be aimed at providing a guarantee that forests will fulfil their productive, socio-economic and ecological functions in the future, too.
At the same time, by retaining the wording of the original texts, the codification is being carried out in full compliance with the procedures involved in adopting acts in the EU.
At the same time, during tomorrow's summit, the High Representative must urge Russia to ratify the Energy Charter because proper energy cooperation cannot exist between the European Union and Russia unless the principles of transparency, reciprocity, competitiveness and non-discrimination are observed.
At the same time, environmental innovation programmes need to be encouraged, so as to plug the gaps which exist in efforts to deal with climate change and promote environmentally-friendly solutions.
At the same time, however, I wish to join forces with the religious representatives who called for the European Union to exert its influence in order to put a stop to the persecution of Christians in countries such as Egypt and Iraq and within Europe, in European Cyprus, where the occupying forces are denying Christians entry to their occupied churches and preventing priests and bishops from celebrating Holy Mass.
At the same time, however, the common agricultural policy must meet the environmental and territorial challenges and objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy while also supporting the competitiveness and sustainability of agricultural industries and rural areas.
At the same time, however, this instrument will fall into disrepute if European Arrest Warrants are used for, say, stolen bicycles, or merely in order to carry out questioning. I regret to say that we have also found that it is being used when perhaps it has been decided not to execute an arrest warrant because there is evidence to show that it was unjustly issued and this is then not respected by the issuing Member State - resulting in the unfortunate situation in which the citizens concerned are repeatedly arrested whenever they cross a border.
At the same time, however, we also have to say that it is our job, in the European Union, to warn consumers when there is a dangerous foodstuff on the market.
At the same time, in Lithuania, the funding earmarked for road management and development has dropped by more than 20% in the last few years.
At the same time, in knowing each other's language, generations growing up would develop a much more positive attitude towards each other, allowing them to create relationships with their peers of the same age more easily, which would be decisive with regard to the future of these regions.
At the same time, it calls for a more strategic approach to cultural cooperation between the EU and third countries.
At the same time, it declares that migrant families and minorities such as the Roma make much less use of the early years education offered than other families.
At the same time, it is absolutely crucial that we ensure that a large number of online services are available to consumers.
At the same time, it is confirmation of how police and judicial cooperation in a cross-border approach to crime can achieve important objectives.
At the same time, it is extremely important that the Greek people understand that in the face of such difficult circumstances a national consensus is necessary: a national consensus and not short-sighted partisan politics.
At the same time, it is imperative to ask misleading business directory companies to cease and desist their deliberately misleading business activities, because they are contrary to the spirit of the Union's competition policy.
At the same time, it is important to ensure security for private individuals, producers, users and public authorities.
At the same time, it is the Presidency's firm intention to maintain the impetus of the process at the meeting of the Competitiveness Council to be held on 31 May 2011, which will also consider the mid-term review of the Small Business Act.
At the same time, it may promote a certain degree of opportunity balance amongst Member States, allowing us to experience the presence of an industry with five million workers, as well as the growth of their numbers in every Member State.
At the same time, it was announced that the Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), for example, would lose much less than the EUR 6 billion in profits expected this year and that, without the exorbitant rates of interest, Greece's deficit would be 1.5% of GDP and not 8%. The speculators are stuffing themselves on taxpayers' money and are clearly set to bleed them dry.
At the same time, it will enable companies to provide goods and services without being subjected to unnecessary legal obstacles.
At the same time, many small and medium-sized businesses, which the EU always praises on paper as being the engine of the economy, were dealt a fatal blow, because, on the basis of the Basel agreements, the banks preferred to hold onto their money, rather than lending it to companies.
At the same time, one has to realise that more Europe cannot be achieved with less money.
At the same time, proceedings are ongoing which could result in the closure of two of the remaining independent newspapers - Nasha Niva and Narodnaya Volya - and the harassment of the political opposition, civil society and the independent media continues.
At the same time, recent data in Europe illustrate that the German economy is growing and that its export figures are higher than at any time since the 1950s. I think that this combination of facts, this inequality and the disparities which are appearing and operating within the European Union are the problem and one of the causes of the problem.
At the same time, research into alternatives to deep disposal of waste must be stepped up. The nuclear issue can no longer be dealt with by sidestepping public opinion, which is increasingly unfavourable towards it. We must have a joint policy on renewable energy and develop other sources of energy, without falling back on fossil fuels, while seeking to ensure that we are self-sufficient.
At the same time, the Committee's opinion draws attention to the fact that the current reduction in the output of emissions in Europe cannot be interpreted as a signal that the EU is on the way to achieving the goal of reduced emissions.
At the same time, the Council and Parliament bear a huge responsibility over the agreement, because they have to decide whether they want to follow the bad practices that have lead to the weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact and indirectly to the crisis as well, or put an end to the policy of agreements made at Member State level and bad bargains, and finally give space to a new economic policy approach that will offer common European solutions, is built on commonly established rules, and will finally complete the economic policy aspect of integration, with a strong Europe in focus.
At the same time, the Internet is often open to abuse: there is exploitation, of children, for example, and crimes committed by taking advantage of the freedoms that the Internet offers.
At the same time, the Union should contribute to making the UN more efficient and transparent, and improve the management of its financial resources.
At the same time, the authorities have focused particular attention on the fight against corruption.
At the same time, the dynamism of urban areas should be stimulated through effective and efficient synergies between the various European financing instruments, especially as regards research and innovation.
At the same time, the recommendations and views expressed in this interim evaluation are, of course, of paramount importance for the preparation of future activities in the field of research and innovation.
At the same time, the report rejects the use in trade agreements of the 'MODE4 process', which allows international companies to import their own labour force, thereby circumventing the host country's social and working conditions.
At the same time, there is also a strong commitment - the strongest possible commitment - on the part of the Member States to reinvest the income generated into the transport system in order to make it more sustainable and to reinvest at least 15% of the income into the trans-European transport network.
At the same time, there is obviously the risk of embezzlement, of the misappropriation of funds. I can see this debate taking place many more times to come in this Parliament.
At the same time, they will allow the smooth development of policies to safeguard the economic future of Europe.
At the same time, this method also enables the Member States to generate resources to reinvest in the transport system in order to make it more sustainable so as to actually reduce these external costs.
At the same time, though, the situation must not be underestimated, and we must now think how to keep the situation under control following the full accession of these countries to Schengen.
At the same time, unemployment of young people under 25 is approaching 20%, while the persisting financial crisis is leading to a reduction in the employment rate, rather than the target of an annual 1% rise.
At the same time, we absolutely need to take into account the huge potential offered by new technologies, which are both a source of information and a channel facilitating the freedom of expression. I think that it would be useful for the European Parliament to include culture on the agenda of discussions with other parliaments in the world, in order to help establish a general practice for European external action.
At the same time, we are also keen for the EU to pursue a responsible budgetary policy and therefore welcome the passages stating that we will also continue to identify and evaluate negative priorities.
At the same time, we are open to discussing with the Member States - and with the Parliament of course - several options regarding the possibility of Eurobonds, provided the Member States are willing to consider that possibility.
At the same time, we believe that each euro being spent now on debt interest means one euro less for the hospitals, public health services, public education and social security.
At the same time, we call on them to abide by the rules of a democratic state and to ensure respect for human rights, which are obligations they assumed as part of the Eastern Partnership.
At the same time, we cannot insist exclusively on strictly economic indicators, which are not always able to pick up on social phenomena.
At the same time, we have also got to grips with the problem of fraud, where other countries are deceived.
At the same time, we hope that CSDP assets will be used effectively to provide humanitarian assistance to the civilian population under attack and that future operations will be planned in such a way as to support the development of democracy in Libya.
At the same time, we must also think about the support measures which are required to prevent the loss of thousands of farming jobs and, above all, the destruction of an entire sector.
At the same time, we need to maintain a balanced approach in dealing with the North and the South of the country, with particular attention being paid to the needs of the South in terms of institution building and governance.
At the same time, we should consider introducing cultural visas for artists and for all those working in the cultural sector.
At the same time, we will continue humanitarian assistance and we will work to ensure that trade is part of the comprehensive approach.
At the same time, we wish to repudiate statements or suggestions alleging that either the Council or the Hungarian Presidency acted dishonestly or in bad faith, or was under the influence of interest groups.
At the same time, what I would like to caution against is expanding the intervention of the Commission in deciding up front what exactly should be the composition of food assistance in any given circumstance.
At the sitting of 6 September 2010, the President announced that he had received a letter sent by the Central District Court of Budapest on 6 July 2010 requesting the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Mrs Hankiss, pursuant to Rule 6(2) of the Rules of Procedure.
At the time of the adoption of the Stockholm Programme, the Commission was asked to table specific proposals aimed at a simple and autonomous European system for the seizure of bank accounts and the temporary freezing of bank deposits.
At the time of this agreement's review, we would like to reiterate that the interests of the movement of capital should not be promoted at the expense of safeguarding the rights of people and workers.
At the time, the EU decided to extend existing national accounts, and the statistical data to be compiled, to key aspects of sustainable development.
At these talks, the ministers fully supported the Presidency's opinion that the four main issues to be handled as priorities are smart regulation, financing, internationalisation and governance.
At this moment, many Member States are making difficult budgetary adjustments, so defending the EU budget should be very well justified.
At this point I must warmly acknowledge Mrs Wortmann-Kool, Mrs Goulard, Mr Haglund, Mrs Ferreira and Mrs Ford, who have been rapporteurs with me throughout this economic governance package. I must also offer a very special word of thanks to the various shadow rapporteurs who have helped us in our work.
At this point, I should also mention the impact of the WTO Doha Development Round on an EU-India FTA.
At this point, I would emphasise that action needs to be taken quickly, especially where young people are concerned: the rise in youth unemployment is, in fact, one of Europe's most pressing challenges.
At this point, I would like to thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to prepare this report and I would also like to thank the European Commission, which has prepared this report and which has included the problems faced by young people amongst the fundamental priorities of the EU's 10-year development plan.
At this point, I would like to underline the importance of the work carried out by the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) and, in particular, the importance of the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) programme which allows the necessary charting and surveillance of forests.
At this point, it would be better to move towards a direct revenue system based exclusively on the gross domestic product of the Member States, or towards a shared and unified form of revenue such as value added tax, for example.
At this stage, let me stress the considerable contribution that many large farms make to rural employment.
At times of crisis, investment is needed in jobs and development.
Attempts have been made to question people who could communicate with the EU representatives, and this is completely unacceptable.
Attention needs to be paid to making more effective use of resources by recycling.
Attention should also be drawn to the fact that, when establishing a new financing instrument for developing countries alone, there must be a thorough analysis of the general objectives, the priority areas and expected results, as well as the allocation of funds.
Attention should be drawn to the fact that the Commission must take immediate action to address the issue of Siberian overflights and begin negotiations on international air transport agreements with Japan and Russia.
Attention should be drawn to the fact that the new regulation would result in much confusion and a lack of clarity in this area.
Austerity champions at home, big spenders in Brussels.
Austria itself, however, should strive to achieve a benchmark when it comes to the unsatisfactory number of highly qualified graduates there.
Austria's citizens are increasingly protesting that too little consideration is given to their concerns.
Authorisations should only be withdrawn when the EU has negotiated a new agreement with an identical level of protection.
Authorising and legitimising pollution if it is economically viable for the company is not a path to sustainability. I believe that the EU's priority should be to impose more stringent measures on pollution caused by heavy goods vehicles and to commit decisively to rail freight.
Aviation companies will also reap the benefits of the Agreement in so much as it provides for the use of each other's repair and maintenance facilities.
Awarding more money to this sector to compensate for the rise in oil prices will only be an even greater incentive for fishermen to use high fuel consuming ships, particularly at a time when the increase in these prices is not transitory but clearly structural.
Awarding the city the title of European Capital of Culture at this juncture would not only help in the cultural regeneration of the city and in improving the city's image in other countries, but would also help to commemorate important aspects of European history and identity.
Aware of the consequences of the Lisbon Treaty, we realised that close cooperation with the European Parliament and its members would be essential for the success of any Presidency in the future.
Awareness of the system varies greatly from country to country, often depending on the number of registered names in a country.
Azerbaijan and other countries in the region need to get a clear signal that violations of human and civil rights cannot be tolerated under any circumstances.
Azerbaijan is party to the European Convention on Human Rights and a member of the Council of Europe, and it has a responsibility to safeguard its citizens' human rights and respect them.
Azerbaijan spends countless petro-dollars trying to convince outsiders of the benign nature of the regime but I, for one, am not fully taken in.
Back in January of this year, the EU approved a EUR 46 million aid package for Georgia, of which EUR 23 million is to be paid as a loan and a further EUR 23 million in the form of a grant to the country.
Bands already designated by the Commission should be freed up by 1 January 2012, according to the Commission's proposal.
Banks that do not pass the tests should immediately seek solutions to tackle the situation, and the Member States - those that have not done so already -should adopt initiatives to help them and contribute to their recapitalisation or to seeking means of resolution.
Banks that pass the stress tests are not exempt from making every effort to tackle adverse scenarios and to prepare for an increasingly demanding regulatory situation.
Barely three months ago, this House adopted a report on implementation of the Services Directive, in which we draw attention principally to the fact that the one-stop shops are not fully operational, that in most cases, they do not allow completion of formalities by electronic means and that they are not working in the way which businesses expect. I hope that drawing attention to individual one-stop shops which are good examples will be followed by greater efforts to improve the operation of all of them, so that they really will serve small and medium-sized enterprises.
Baroness Ashton knows that she has our support in her human rights policy, and in respect of the rebels in Benghazi she made clear choices, and rightly so. Do the same now in connection with Omar al-Bashir, as the people of South Sudan deserve our strong support.
Baroness Ashton, Bashar al-Assad should not just top the list of those subject to EU sanctions but should be put on the list of criminals to be tried by the ICC or European courts for the brutal repression of the Syrian people.
Baroness Ashton, the European Union must be ambitious. I hope that this proposal will appear in your White Paper.
Baroness Ashton, we can all remember the Copenhagen climate change summit as an example of the useless cacophony that is brought about by over-representation of the European Union and its Member States.
Baroness Ashton, we will only have a robust foreign and security policy if we put all our weight behind and all our energies into a few clearly defined objectives.
Baroness Ashton, you have already intervened on the subject of the Egyptian Copts; however, not only has the persecution continued, but today, it is a worrying element in the so-called 'Arab Spring'. The communications from the European External Action Service still talk of it as being a conflict between extremists.
Baroness Ashton, you have an important role; please fulfil it to the utmost, in the knowledge that the time available is quickly running out.
Baroness Ashton, you were warned months ago by Members of Parliament that this latest massacre was going to occur, and we repeatedly asked you to act on this.
Based on existing systems which were created and launched by Parliament in 1996 and by the Commission in 2008, it seeks to address certain recent problems, although the argument for it in the report is the new powers entrusted to the European Parliament following the Treaty of Lisbon's entry into force.
Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on braking devices of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on rear-mounted roll-over protection structures of narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on roll-over protection structures mounted in front of the driver's seat on narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the installation, location, operation and identification of the controls of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the operating space, access to the driving position and the doors and windows of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this report on the proposal for a Council regulation on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
Based on the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and following the processes of consultation and evaluation of the credentials of the nominee, specifically in light of the requirements set out in Article 283(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), and in view of the need for the European Central Bank (ECB) to be fully independent, I voted in favour of the report on the appointment of the President of the ECB, and I welcome Mr Draghi's appointment.
Basically, 'port state measures' means those measures that coastal states may apply to vessels that are not allowed to fly their flags in port or are seeking permission to enter a port.
Basically, the 2012 budget can be considered the little brother of the legislative package on economic governance, because it, too, aims to establish the conditions for a balanced budget and economic growth, and to increase employment and competitiveness though appropriate means of economic and budgetary policy.
Basically, what this involves is that a misleading business directory sends out a form, which appears to simply request people to update their own personal details or their business details, in return for what appears to be a free entry, a free listing in the business directory.
Be careful then because, when we open a debate on what a constitutional text does or does not contain, perhaps we should first of all clear up a misunderstanding.
Be that as it may, I should like to point out on the question of the Dublin II Regulation that, for certain countries today like my country, Greece, which lie on the external borders of the Union and actually receive approximately 90% of immigrants who land in Europe, the Dublin II Regulation is unacceptable; it is not something that local populations can accept; it is not something that the countries can accept.
Be the agent of change that we need. I promise you: only this will save your position, and nothing else.
Be under no illusion: we are very clear, I am very clear, with all of the leaders I speak to about what I believe needs to happen, and I do so with the support of this House and with the support of the Foreign Affairs Council of the 27 Member States.
Bearing in mind that European cooperation is a necessity, not a choice, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution by the European Parliament on the EU as a global actor.
Bearing in mind that compensatory measures have been carried out in this project, that an attempt has been made to put right any wrongdoing that may have taken place, then surely the project can be rubber-stamped.
Bearing in mind that several taxes and charges are already levied on the road transport sector, especially excise duties on fuel, and in view of the current economic climate, I think that the internalisation of the sector's costs should be considered so that these measures might merit greater consensus between the various players affected.
Bearing in mind that the European Union budget is primarily an investment budget, which can generate more investment from public or private sources, it must be possible to adjust it adequately to changing needs and circumstances.
Bearing in mind that this financial assistance is one-off assistance of limited duration, I voted in favour of the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council to grant additional macro-financial assistance to Georgia.
Bearing in mind the economic and financial crisis we are currently experiencing, it is never too much to redouble one's efforts with regard to the financial sector, beginning with corporate governance which, most of the time, does not take customers into account, whether they are savers, depositors, etc. I therefore welcome the Commission's Green Paper, and welcome its proposals, which can and should accompany and complement the regulations adopted to strengthen the financial system in the context of the new European supervisory system. I am therefore voting in favour of the report on corporate governance in financial institutions, and I hope that this will contribute decisively to their strength.
Bearing in mind the experience of the Lisbon Strategy, the evolution of the Urban Agenda must not be a one-way process, but have an organic dimension with a bottom-up approach.
Bearing in mind the fact that every initiative in the area of contract law will have to respond clearly to the actual needs and problems of businesses and consumers, I take the view that any justification in this area will have to be based on practical evidence relating to the current situation in contract law and any difficulties encountered by businesses and consumers, particularly in cross-border transactions.
Bearing in mind the importance of the trust that European citizens and consumers put in financial institutions and transactions for the stability of our financial system and, consequently, for the smooth functioning of the Internal Market, I welcome the Commission's Green Paper and the opportunity to improve corporate governance structures throughout the EU. Several things will need to be done in order to ensure the smooth and sustainable functioning of the European financial market, the most important of which, in my opinion, are a targeted approach responding to the needs of the real economy and the implementation of a policy of increased social responsibility and risk assessment by boards in order to avoid a financial crisis in the future.
Because domestic work takes place largely within the family home, there can be issues of privacy involved.
Because of Lisbon, investment treaties can become an instrument for the Commission's political objectives - and not just the Commission's: we can be absolutely sure that the Greens will try to advance their political programme, and we have seen that in the trade treaties time after time.
Because of my position as S&D group shadow Rapporteur on this report I could not join my colleagues from the Maltese delegation in voting against the amendment tabled by my group on fiscal convergence.
Because of the far-reaching consequences of ratings, intensive interaction with this sector is unavoidable.
Because of the weakness in the banking system, we are hesitant about introducing the debt restructuring measures urgently needed in the weaker countries.
Because of this, the new CAP must include transitional arrangements in established sectors subjected to radical change going forward.
Because pursuant to Article 28 of the Council Framework Decision, a person who has been surrendered pursuant to a European Arrest Warrant shall not be extradited to a third State without the consent of the competent authority of the Member State which surrendered the person.
Because the Council is not able to address the current imbalance in our society and to give Parliament the opportunity of making the ministers from the Member States directly accountable to us, the results of the trialogue are being weakened.
Because this is important to me personally, I should like you to grant me a roll-call vote on every amendment on this report under the same Rule whereby you granted it to the gentleman over there.
Because we have a close relationship with this country, we certainly have to engage in dialogue, but my position is closer to Mr Watson's thinking: that we need to take a tough hand as well, because if you go 'softly, softly' on a continuous basis, you will get nowhere.
Because we worked in conjunction all the time, I must mention the important introduction of a European semester regime in the preventive part, and point out that the preventive part is essential and that penalties should only be applied as the final step in this whole procedure.
Because while you pretend to be concerned about foreign workers, European workers are being excluded from the picture.
Before I give you the floor, Commissioner, let me first extend a welcome on behalf of this House to the members of a delegation from the People's Consultative Assembly of the Republic of Indonesia, who have just taken their seats in the official gallery above.
Before a European Arrest Warrant is issued, therefore, consideration should be given to how serious the offence is, what the expected penalty is and whether there is a simpler way of dealing with the matter.
Before agreement can be reached, there is one fundamental stumbling block: the recognition that in an internal market, in a monetary area, it makes sense that the variations in the scoreboard indicators should be observed whether they are positive or negative, and that both deficits and surpluses should be subject to observation, even though they obviously do not give rise to similar recommendations.
Before being able to think about the possible admittance of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area, special and detailed plans must be drawn up to contain migratory pressures.
Before concluding, I should like to mention our commitment to supporting innovation in the textile and clothing sector.
Before the introduction of the warrant, the average time taken to extradite a wanted person was one year, whereas in these four years in which the EAW has been applied, it has been shown that approximately 50% of wanted persons agreed to their surrender after about 15 days.
Before we begin, I would like to say a few words.
Before we proceed to the vote on the report, I would like to underline that the ongoing activities of the working group on the code of conduct for MEPs and outside interests do not intend to put into question the substance of the agreement reached with the Commission and the content of the Casini report.
Before we start promoting these cultures outside Europe, even we ourselves have to want to become familiarised with all those cultural elements which are typical of Europe.
Being both a shared and a rare asset, we need to have a good understanding, firstly, of how spectrum is used today, hence, this idea of a wide-ranging, comprehensive study on how spectrum is currently being used by all stakeholders, including those whom Mr Chichester just singled out, namely, civil protection services, for example, and even military services.
Being part of the euro area has been instrumental for most Member States in weathering the adverse effects of the crisis; nevertheless forming part of this group also entails responsibilities as the potential default of one Member State will see a wave of negative effects across the entire area.
Belarus has a responsibility to safeguard its citizens' human rights and respect them.
Belarus is the missing piece of Europe's democratic jigsaw puzzle, and I long for the day when it rejoins the European family.
Belgium successfully did so in the 1990s for almost a decade.
Besides Youth on the Move, funding and political support should be given to programmes such as Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Comenius, Grundtvig, Youth in Action and Marie Curie.
Besides that, I feel compelled to make another crucial point: behind the humanitarian emergency and the immigration problem lurks a political problem.
Besides the number of places available, we must also address the question of quality at European and national level. I am thinking, for example, of staffing and staff quality, the integration of care and education, and active engagement with parents, who are the first educators of their children.
Besides, import authorisations, ex post statistical surveillance systems and the requirements of single administrative documents already ensure that imports are effectively controlled in the Union.
Better implementation is, I think, in the interests of us all.
Better use can be made of the forest in this fight, not only through preventing felling, but also through afforestation and reforestation programmes.
Between 1985 and 2011 alone, apart from the immeasurable wealth appropriated by capital from exploiting the working class in Greece, monopoly capital at home and abroad plundered EUR 628 billion in interest and repayments, either as lender or borrower.
Between 2008 and 2010, French fishermen, for example, lost EUR 100-200 in income per week as a result of fluctuating oil prices, even though their turnover remained the same.
Between 9 and 15 January 2011, the majority of South Sudan's population declared itself to be in favour of creating an independent state.
Between legal fees, translation fees and implementation fees, it can cost small businesses up to EUR 15 000 to enter the e-commerce market of just one Member State.
Beyond simply knowing the origin of textile products from outside the Union, it is essential to ensure that European standards are met, and to not allow raw materials and processed products to enter and be sold in the Union without meeting the minimum conditions. I also believe that more important than ascertaining the type of products used in the manufacture of textile products is to assess whether these are in compliance with competition rules and respect for workers' dignity and rights, as cases where these are violated are on the increase.
Beyond that, we are now seeing an apparently never-ending power struggle being played out.
Big projects like the European patent and the Digital Agenda need to deliver for these small businesses, providing jobs and a future for people in Wales and the whole of the EU.
Bilateral development and trade agreements should always require not just elements of social responsibility but also cultural elements.
Bilateral trade volumes between the EU and Japan lag behind the bulk of the EU's trade exchanges with its other main trading partners because of the negative effects of Japanese non-tariff barriers (NTBs). I supported the resolution's provision that the EU-Japan FTA has the potential to lead to a win-win situation, beneficial for both economies.
Blinded by profit, this approach limits democracy and sovereignty, and creates greater dependency in countries such as Portugal that need to create employment, and produce and create wealth in order to raise the standard of living; that do not need more deindustrialisation, less agricultural production and less fishing.
Bon appetit, but be careful you do not choke on it.
Border control ensures that commercial operators supply detailed information during trade operations, guaranteeing, at the same time, the right equilibrium between speed and security of trade flows.
Bosnians, meanwhile, are characterised by great friendliness and hospitality. I recently read the reminiscences of a Polish student who took part in a student exchange in Sarajevo - she did not meet a single foreign student who was there as part of the exchange who did not like Sarajevo.
Both Bulgaria and Romania have taken very significant steps to bring their countries' policy and practice up to the Schengen standards.
Both States have met the criteria for the full application of the Schengen acquis.
Both States will have to cooperate fully so as not to jeopardise a system which depends on mutual trust between the Member States. I support the rapporteur's position.
Both agriculture and forestry can, of course, play an important role in achieving the EU's climate objectives, and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture are actually included in the EU's Effort Sharing Mechanism, but emissions and removals of CO2 related to land use, land-use change and forestry (what we call LULUCF) are not part of the current reduction commitment as adopted back in the 2008 in the climate and energy package.
Both belong to the most visible and popular achievements of European integration.
Both countries are pursuing very ambitious programmes of fiscal consolidation, structural reform and financial repair.
Both countries have worked very hard and deserve the maximum amount of appreciation for their efforts.
Both decisions are wrong; however, because of the time constraints, among other reasons, I intend to focus solely on the issue of merit, but only after voicing my full support for Mr Moreira's speech.
Both he and we intend to submit a new text that further enhances environmental protection, which especially takes into consideration the areas of climate change, energy and biodiversity, which also includes relevant important rulings by the European Court of Justice and which harmonises and simplifies the existing procedures as far as possible and, moreover, excludes circumvention more clearly than previously.
Both in terms of payments to farmers and in terms of the second pillar - or through investments, by supporting the production of local goods - we will be able to respond to these objectives.
Both initiatives are testament to the great importance that the Committee on International Trade and, in our view, Parliament, should place on this matter.
Both markets would benefit greatly from upgrading trade relations between the EU and Japan, especially keeping in mind innovation and technologies. I would also welcome further cooperation on matters relating to cyber security.
Both of these are significant European cultural achievements and I believe that giving these up could signal the end of the European social integration process.
Both parties expect to reap significant benefits from the removal of tariffs, and the liberalisation of trade in services and company start-ups, but I share the disappointment expressed in the resolution as regards the slow rate of progress of negotiations on the free trade agreement (FTA). Both parties must make every effort to ensure that a comprehensive, ambitious and coordinated FTA has been concluded by 2011, because this agreement would be the basis for establishing opportunities to increase EU and Indian trade and investment, and develop business, and the FTA would increase overall exports and imports for both the European Union and India. I agree with the position set out in the resolution that if economic cooperation between the EU and India is based on common universal values, it may become an example for cooperation with other countries.
Both parties expect to secure significant benefits from the elimination of tariffs and the liberalisation of trade in services and company formation, and reaffirm their commitment to tariff reductions and further liberalisation of company formation and trade in services.
Both parties still need to find an agreement on several crucial chapters of the negotiations, among others, on access to government procurement, investment and public services.
Both sides are also significant investors in each other's economy, with a combined volume of Foreign Direct Investment worth EUR 200 billion in 2009.
Both the Commission and defence rights organisations like Fair Trials International - I declare an interest, I am a patron - and Justice, on whose council I sit, have pinpointed failings in the arrest warrant.
Both the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control have delivered a positive opinion on the implementation of the budget of the Community Fisheries Control Agency.
Both the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control issued a positive opinion on the implementation of the budget of the Artemis Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009.
Both the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control issued a positive opinion on the implementation of the budget of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2009.
Both the European Union and the United Nations have acquired experience in programmes which have produced real results in Somalia and that work must be continued and increased.
Both the Stoiber working group and the review of the Small Business Act presented by the European Commission have confirmed that administrative obstacles and excessive burdens relating to control measures often cause delays, and sometimes even prevent the further expansion of small companies which have the potential to generate new jobs.
Both the submitted reports and the debate so far consider culture and education from a variety of perspectives. I consider the development of creativity right from birth to be a very important aspect.
Both totalitarian systems kept their citizens under submission and were more likely not to allow them to leave their country than the opposite, but these obstacles do not exist now.
Brian Simpson's report adopted today will thus enable Parliament's role in international aviation negotiations to be defined better.
Bringing together economic, social and ecological efficiencies will also put an end to the ultra-liberal free trade model that is currently destroying family farms.
British fishermen are facing further losses in the number of days at sea and are slowly being driven out of business.
Broad assistance should not mean interference, however, because the development of civil society, democracy and the rule of law must, in my opinion, remain in Arab and Muslim hands.
Brussels could not care less about Turkey's Armenian genocide.
Brussels, which is considered by some to be second only to Washington as a mecca for lobbyists, needs proper regulations and clearly-defined principles of cooperation between decision makers and representatives of various interest groups.
Budget support must always be accompanied by actions to develop the receiving country's parliamentary control and audit capacities and to increase transparency and public access to information, and civil society should be involved in monitoring budget support.
Budgetary choices, which are key to determining the path each country will follow, according to its specific characteristics, its interests and the will of its people, are under threat.
Budgetary plans should take account of the most important objectives of sustainable development, at the same time as being flexible and focused on concrete measures. I barely need mention the fact that money must be spent transparently and for good reason.
Building educational success is the focus of this report, and it is also the reason why we voted in favour.
Building on what we have already talked about are mobility, market access and money, or the 'three Ms', as a simple way of describing it. Some things are extremely important to support these countries into the future.
Building strong foundations in terms of education and care during children's early lives, as a complement to the central role of the family, constitutes the crucial basis for success in terms of learning throughout their lives, social integration, personal development and future employability.
Bulgaria and Romania are fully-fledged Member States of the European Union and our approach to them must be the same as to any other EU Member State.
Bulgaria and Romania have been Member States of the EU for four years, but some fellow Members appear not to have noticed that, and some of their questions and racist remarks about these countries really concern me as an EU citizen, because if we talk about illegal immigrants from these countries somehow invading our territory, we are actually referring to members and citizens of the EU, and they surely cannot be illegal immigrants.
Bulgaria and Romania have been subjected to the evaluation of the proper application of all parts of the Schengen acquis: control of the land, sea and air borders, police cooperation, visas, connection to the Schengen Information System (SIS), and data protection.
Bulgaria and Romania have done a considerable amount of work on strengthening their border controls and have succeeded.
Bulgaria and Romania satisfy the requirements for full integration into the Schengen area, based on their evaluation reports and the reports by the expert monitoring teams.
Bulgaria should adopt additional measures, including a special plan that includes measures to be applied at the moment of entry to the Schengen area.
Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus only partially apply the Schengen acquis at the moment and checks are therefore still carried out at the borders with these three Member States.
Burning is often the cheapest method to recover these valuable metals as adults and children scramble over the dumps of rubbish in their quest to earn a few cents.
Businesses have to face additional administrative hassle, the checking of labels requires additional customs formalities and, ultimately, it becomes more expensive to import products.
Businesses in Europe must remain competitive.
Businesses must also contribute to sustainable development in order to foster good conditions for workers, but the difference between developed and developing countries still lies in their systems of social protection. I am voting in favour of the proposal under discussion in light of the above and also in order that there may be greater promotion of labour and social standards in EU Member States and non-Member States alike, as well as respect for fundamental international labour standards.
Businesses that operate in a globally responsible way help shape foreign policy and development policy.
But Congress should also help him and press him to reverse this decision to reinstate the military commission system, as it offers no guarantee of a fair trial, and it must also reverse the decision to keep in indefinite detention detainees against whom no charges are brought.
But I also believe that the responsibility of political leaders at European or national level, whether they are in government or in opposition, is to show what countries have to do. In fact, without fiscal consolidation, without structural reform, Greece will not come out of this crisis.
But I am afraid some of the amendments to which the Commission has already made reference take away from the spirit of our initial intentions and the initial way in which we reacted.
But I think that the rules for application of the Fund should be changed in order to make the assistance available for less developed Member States of the European Union.
But I want to say, too, that there is greater coherence than perhaps anyone listening to this debate might imagine.
But a darker interpretation, reflecting on some Member States themselves, will be cast by the fact that Member States - and in many cases the supervisors are the culprits - were not bolder incoming clean.
But after various business and interest groups had got involved the proposal was reduced to 12 months only - with quarterly reviews! Further, any deal needs a waiver from the World Trade Organisation, which they haven't approved as some member countries (notably India) are worried about the effect that duty-free Pakistani textiles would have on their own markets.
But also I just want to say that I strongly support the increased support for the lifelong learning programme Grundtvig, and I particularly also welcome increasing support for the Life+ Programme.
But development cooperation is the one policy area of external action (besides humanitarian aid) which is not designed to serve EU interests, but to defend the interests of the most vulnerable populations of this planet.
But does she share my dismay at the hypocrisy of the European Union? As she and I both know, the EU is opposed to the death penalty, and yet the joint statement by President Barroso and President von Rompuy on the death of Bin Laden says that it 'shows that such crimes do not remain unpunished'. Does that imply acceptance that the death penalty is a punishment?
But generally we are, even for cohesion, very much below what was the upgraded forecast of the Member States for 2012.
But if we do not take it seriously, neither will the rest of the world.
But is he aware that, in his own government, one of the first acts of the Home Secretary, Theresa May, when coming into office was to opt into the European Investigation Order, which means we now cannot opt out and will be stuck with whatever comes through the legislative sausage machine, because this will be subject to qualified majority voting and the final outcome is something we cannot determine? Is this another case of Tory double-speak, where they speak out against the acts of the European Union here but endorse them back home in our own parliament?
But is this problem caused by the increase in fuel prices? Are you sure about that? We have discussed this problem again and again and we recognised that we had this problem even before prices were raised.
But it is clear, and this was in the presentation by the rapporteur, that under the present unusual circumstances drafting and finding compromises on the 2012 budget cannot be 'business as usual'. Therefore, a balance between consolidation of public finances and investment conducive to growth and jobs is a must and I think this is visible in our draft.
But it would certainly serve as a very good instrument and good indicator that those who register are prepared to respect the rules and be transparent, that they have nothing to hide and - this should be the key indicator for all of us - that they should be real partners to work with us and exchange information with us and that they have trust in our future communication.
But let me state clearly that the Commission will not accept any attempts to undermine the Schengen principles.
But let us not dodge the elephant in the room: this is not just about banks, it is about sovereign debt and the stability of the euro: inextricably linked and overwhelmingly important.
But let us not play this off against what happens in other countries like the Bahamas.
But let us remember that we need to set priorities at all levels, at the European level as well as in Member States. I must say that I dislike EU-bashing or Brussels-bashing, but I also dislike Member States-bashing, because it diminishes the importance of the spending we have in the Member States: health care, social security, pensions, education.
But look too at all the letters from industry, really lobbying for going to 30% because it is in their interest; it helps their profits if we step up our climate ambitions.
But negotiations on our common steps at expert level are, to date, not finished.
But now is the time to be bold, to be more ambitious and to achieve more. I have seen so much creativity in Wales, as it develops into a hub of activity for new businesses in the highly profitable global gaming world and a centre for cultural excellence with regard to film and programme production, yet I find myself asking questions about how to foster and encourage this development.
But now, after churches were burned and Christians killed in a renewed wave of attacks, the time has come for the EU to make it abundantly clear to the Egyptian authorities that they are responsible for the internal security of the country and for the protection of the rights and livelihood of all Egyptian citizens.
But our action against IUU fishing must not only comprise Port State Measures; we must also campaign to end the use of 'flags of convenience', which often allow vessels to operate illegally and with impunity. A global registry of fishing vessels could also be an important step, as could traceability of fishery products.
But people do not become asylum seekers simply because they live in a dangerous country.
But that also requires the Council (I am not referring just to Hungary, I am talking about the Member States) to help us in pushing forward the procedural guarantees, and the issue of unacceptable pre-trial detention periods for many citizens in my own country.
But the Commissioner has put his finger on it in relation to a number of issues: first of all, the fact that there are some diverse standards; secondly, the long time that it takes from the time of application to actual registration.
But the ESM will only complement the new framework for reinforced economic surveillance, which focuses on prevention and is of primary essence because it will substantially reduce the probability of crises such as we have experienced emerging in the future.
But the Treaty of Lisbon allows you not to do so: you can form coalitions of the willing and build up a systematic form of reinforced cooperation.
But the bottom line is - and nobody referred to it other than the Commissioner - that there is a EUR 20 billion benefit to both economies here if we can work out a free trade agreement.
But the closure of the border by France to Italian trains, and Danish demands to mend Schengen shows it is in crisis.
But the fact that we have opted in is a good indication that we are determined to deal with cross-border crime. I trust the honourable gentleman shares our wishes in that regard.
But the hardest case is going to be creating an even playing field in relation to procedural defence rights.
But the positive momentum of the immediate post-referendum period has vanished.
But then when they all discussed it over the phone, they said the Germans are going to be very suspicious, so we need to invite them to this meeting.
But then, here in this Parliament we have a couple of 'Pavlovs': Mr Schulz, Mr Daul, Mr Verhofstadt, all absent now - they have run away instead of speaking here to focus the budget on quality rather than quantity, for example, by limiting regional and cohesion funds to the poorer Member States, saving 30% of those funds, and investing that money in innovation and future oriented policies.
But there is no certainty - not in the outcome in any country - and no quick fix or short-term solution that will create the world so many people want to see.
But there we are in the hands of the WTO as to whether or not we get a waiver, and this waiver can only be obtained by unanimity, so we cannot force this within the WTO.
But this is an opportunity to talk about renewing faith in the Schengen system and the integrity of the European Union itself, and an opportunity to improve a completely outdated and ineffective evaluation mechanism.
But under these proposals, all services are open, except those specifically excluded at the outset.
But we do insist that the four items I have mentioned are red lines and have to be dealt with properly in these negotiations.
But we have over 2 000 parents, brothers, mothers and sisters in Cyprus who are suffering every day as they wonder about the fate of their loved one.
But we know that Greece has no intention of leaving the eurozone. I am in constant contact with both the Greek authorities and the main opposition party and I know very well that they do not want to leave the eurozone.
But we need to be mindful that we are legislating for the real world, not making a wish list for an ideal world, and that Parliament should stick to its areas of competence in future.
But we should aim to make significant progress in a number of areas.
But we should indeed call for what you have termed deep democracy, and we have to work seriously to support civil society in Russia. I would like to highlight some points in the joint resolution that the European Parliament will adopt tomorrow.
But what about the million Europeans who live at risk of poverty? Twenty per cent of Lithuanians live in poverty.
But what does that mean? What is the strategic perspective? What effect will this have?
But what we need to bear in mind is our strong political stance and declaration and our support for civilian operations. I believe, as I said to South Sudan, that we should not expect all the issues to be resolved by 9 July.
But while performance is important, research and innovation does mean we also have to accept some risk- taking as well, and we cannot rule that out.
But yet what we really should be focusing on is making the EU work better.
But, all right, this concession to France and Italy is fortunately merely symbolic. I am also pleased that, in its proposals, the Commission has shown that it, too, is aware that it does not have to look for solid solutions to a more efficient asylum and migration policy under church towers, and that this requires another, more European, form of cooperation.
But, as evidence indicates, this is not enough.
But, because there are lots of Poles in the UK, most of whom are very welcome, we get lots of arrest warrants from Poland.
But, in fact, we have different problems because this is the first time we have had this type of monetary union without some more integrated institutional setting.
But, just as the EU should be proud that we have contributed to a largely peaceful and credible referendum process - and I pay tribute to my colleague, Veronique De Keyser, for her personal leadership - the EU must give priority to helping South Sudan with its constitutional review process, entrenching a multi-party system and preventing corruption from taking any root from the start.
By 'European family', I mean the overseas countries and territories (OCT), which, although not strictly European territories, maintain a special relationship with the European Union, and, in particular, with the Member States of which they are part.
By 2050, that figure will be 5% or 6%. In 2100, we will make up 3% of that population.
By abolishing checks at the internal borders of signatory countries and creating a common area, it made the free movement of people and goods throughout the European Union possible.
By adopting the 'Small Business Act' in 2008, the European Commission made the first decisive step for these SMEs by introducing the 'Think Small First' principle in all areas of legislation.
By adopting the drafted resolution, we will give both the Commission and the High Representative the necessary mandate for this.
By adopting the report by Mrs Fraga Estévez at lunchtime today, Parliament has given its approval for the European Union to enter into a binding international agreement to combat illegal fishing, thereby demonstrating its commitment to responsible fishing also.
By adopting this proposal for a directive, which replaces four existing directives with one, we hope to improve the regulation of consumer protection and guarantee everyone a minimum level of protection.
By adopting this report, I welcome the fact that Amendment 74 was preserved, since it advocates the creation of a category of regions referred to as 'intermediate' for the next programming period 2007-2013 of the cohesion policy and is therefore along the lines of fairer distribution of structural and cohesion funds between regions.
By adopting this report, Parliament approves the granting of discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2009.
By adopting this report, Parliament has given its support to the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the latter's participation in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).
By adopting this resolution, the European Parliament is sending a clear signal to the European Commission on the future implementation of the Framework Programme for research.
By amending the constitution in that way, without really involving other parties or civil society organisations, it is undermining the democratic process, killing off dynamism and threatening to impose the exclusive right of a single party.
By approving Mr Klinz's report appealing for effective regulation of rating agencies, Parliament is taking another step towards greater transparency in the financial markets.
By approving the Hökmark report, Parliament is opting for innovation: the broadband and mobile telephony sector is not only of great interest to Europeans, but it makes it possible to develop new prospects in terms of research and development, areas in which the European Union can and must aspire to play a leading role.
By arguing in favour of graduated direct payments and a review of the regulatory instruments, the report also provides a new perspective on social perception of the CAP and of global trade.
By asking to participate in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), the Republic of Croatia has shown that it shares the interest of the EU and its Member States in the objectives and work of the Centre, the task of which is to collect data on drugs and drug addiction in order to prepare and publish objective, reliable and comparable information at European level.
By basically proposing that the EU budget be frozen until the 2020 review, with a residual increase of 5%, many of the objectives that feature in the course of its 40 pages are being compromised, particularly, that of social and economic cohesion.
By being an inn, Cervantes meant lying still, complaining that one is ignored and remaining static.
By calling for a rise in de minimis aid from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 for the next three years, we want to send out a strong signal to the sector, which, in recent years, particularly because of the entry into force of the common fisheries policy and new restrictive measures, has seen some small- and medium-scale modes of fishing cut back, if not killed off completely.
By calling for common minimum standards for all the Member States, we are encouraging their governments to invest in new technologies, with a view to obtaining rapid, concrete results in relation to the disposal of this extremely hazardous waste.
By calling for simplified, enhanced and transparent aid allocation within the framework of the Europe 2020 strategy, this report seeks to stimulate the European cohesion programmes in order to address administrative burdens, the latter being the reason why most allocated funds are currently being withheld.
By creating a clear path for creative thinking and the resulting ideas, we can all gain intellectual and economic advantages.
By creating it, we will preserve this budget. I think that no one here wishes to see this budget reduced. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur, Mr Pieper, for his work.
By developing the CCIs, we are contributing to sustainable economic development and job creation.
By doing so, we will have taken the first crucial decision. I am very confident that we will succeed in strengthening the credibility of Europe and of matters relating to the environment and to the economy as a result of these environmental economic accounts.
By emphasising spectral efficiency, we will remedy this situation without limiting the diversity of services available on the spectrum.
By enhancing our capacity to deal with crisis situations, it will put a more robust governance system in place that will equip decision-makers with better tools to resist populist or extremist pressure in the future.
By evaluating the work of the prosecutor in advance, before the end of the investigation, we prevent justice from being implemented.
By failing to provide accounts on the private and social cost of the use of natural resources and on the damage to the environment, conventional accounts may send the wrong progress message to the decision makers and this may put society on the road to non-sustainable growth.
By failing to see what it is, the regime loses its legitimacy and estranges itself from the people and from the international community.
By giving children the ability to realise their potential, quality education and care structures can contribute significantly to achieving two of the major objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy: reducing early school drop-out rates below 10% and lifting at least 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion.
By giving the European Union legal personality, the Treaty increased the possibilities for it to join the various international and regional organisations and groups of states.
By guaranteeing clear consumer protection, we will be able to strengthen consumer confidence in the internal market and more generally towards the European Union.
By improving synergies, we will be able to increase the European added value of cohesion policy for local and regional partners across the European Union, which will in turn enable citizens to draw increased benefits.
By increasing the funding for projects that support youth mobility and increasing the focus on the cooperation between business and education, young Europeans will have a better chance of career success.
By introducing EU contract law and making it optional for businesses to choose domestic or European legislation, it confuses the system and will create legislative overlaps that may result in expensive tribunals.
By introducing the 'polluter pays' principle for heavy goods vehicles, the directive paves the way for the recognition in our public policies of the internalisation of external costs caused by transport.
By linking the direct payment to an economic variable we can achieve the transition from a Europe of 15 Member States to a Europe of 27 without offending anyone too much.
By naming the city a European Capital of Culture in 2014, we could send an important signal for the multi-ethnic character of the city and the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which could also give the political class in that country cause to rethink their ideas.
By negotiating a 'negative' list of services that would not be included in the free trade agreements, and if it were to go ahead, the Commission would be reversing the rationale that has prevailed hitherto.
By now, it is clear that the current mechanism has too many inconsistencies, the most famous of which is the United Kingdom's correction mechanism.
By now, we have managed to reduce the outstanding issues to one single major issue and some technicalities. I am convinced that the text we have on the table now is stronger and more suited to preventing future crises.
By passing this report on the new Multiannual Financial Framework by 468 to 134 (with 54 abstentions), the Parliament confirms that it is living in a different world from the harsh economic reality of our times.
By promoting the exchange of good practice, relentlessly combating pollution and illegal activities at sea, and preventing accidents, we will be able to benefit from the sea's growth potential for a long time yet.
By providing access to the relevant information, establishing a constructive dialogue and taking into account the view of Parliament, the Council will not only show its goodwill in terms of cooperating with us, but it will also send a powerful message about one of the guardians of European values, as well as about transparent cooperation and partnership.
By refusing this kind of oil, the European Union would retain its credibility in terms of its desire to protect the environment and comply with the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol.
By regulating both business-to-business and business-to-consumer contractual relations, adopting an optional instrument together with a 'toolbox' could ensure enhanced protection of consumers in Europe.
By removing some of these days off we could create around a thousand jobs.
By selecting the right way forwards in the area of contract law, it is possible to contribute in a significant way to the better functioning of the Single Market and to making its full potential available to businesses (especially small and medium-sized ones) and consumers.
By setting labour standards, the European Union fosters the possibility for citizens to obtain work in conditions of freedom, equality, safety and dignity.
By strengthening the role of the European Union at the United Nations, we will succeed in ensuring that the EU takes a leading role in regional and global affairs.
By supporting the report on the European Urban Agenda and its Future in Cohesion Policy, I am advocating a new approach to urban policy based on close cooperation between operators at the various levels of decision-making: EU, national level, urban areas and peripheral urban areas.
By taking into account only economic activity - wealth creation - and being useful, therefore, in determining economic growth, it does not cover parameters as important as wealth distribution, social inequalities, the quality of goods and services, non-commercial transactions or even outcomes not recorded by the market, which are essential to the assessment of development and progress.
By the end of 2013, the Commission should table a report addressing issues such as the situation of our forests and how depleted our fisheries resources are.
By the end of June, we are expecting a new Managing Director to have been appointed for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has, as we all know, been accused of a very serious crime that, unfortunately, has probably also damaged the reputation of the IMF.
By the same token, I insist that my country, the Czech Republic, also has the right to determine for itself how it will produce electricity.
By the way, I gave them very good news because I announced that the Commission is going to put forward initiatives relating to transparency for raw materials - good or bad news depending on perspective: less transparency makes it easier for some regimes to use revenues from their national resources and raw materials in a non-transparent way, sometimes with the complicity, we have to say, of the so-called developed world.
By the way, I see a lot of synergies between the use of spectrum for the distribution of content and culture, especially talking about audiovisual media content and for wireless broadband.
By the way, it amazes me that some members, as was the case with Mr Verhofstadt just yesterday, are advocating an investment strategy while being content with this package.
By the way, it is not always easy to make a clear distinction: was Fukushima caused by nature or by human beings? I would claim it was originally a natural disaster - earthquake and flooding - however, human strengths and weaknesses came into play when it came to taking control of the risk and in reducing and avoiding damage.
By the way, temporary border controls were introduced on the basis of the Schengen regime of 2006 for the European Football Championship and for the football World Cup as a defence against hooliganism.
By the way, this Parliament has been discussing this for ten years, but the experts outside have been discussing it for 30 years.
By this I mean cooperation and joint radioactive waste treatment projects.
By this I mean that deliberate attacks on nuclear power stations, perhaps by terrorists, in whatever form, including cyber attacks and attacks by aircraft, do not form part of the stress test.
By this we can show once again that the EU is committed to transparency not only in words, but also in deeds.
By this, we would like to show clearly that Europe cares; Europe is solidarity and Europe can help if the country is in such distress.
By voting against the report, I intend to show my opposition to its proposed future scenario in which national diplomacy would substantially be superseded by Union diplomacy, to the detriment of the Member States' diplomatic autonomy.
By voting for the Garriga Polledo report, the European Parliament has made its voice heard on the future of the European budget and put forward an ambitious proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework.
By voting in favour of the 'Youth on the Move' programme - a framework aimed at improving education and training systems in Europe - I wanted to support an ambitious action plan in favour of young Europeans.
By way of conclusion, I would briefly like to emphasise the following: let us make use of all this positive energy that we have here in the European Parliament, the temple of European democracy, as well as in the European Commission, and let us do everything to ensure this report does not remain merely a dead letter.
By way of conclusion, I would like to emphasise that, in order to achieve genuine social, economic and territorial cohesion and ensure that every European citizen has a good place to live and work, the size of the cohesion policy funds in the next programming period must be at least the same as in the current period.
By way of example, this tool was used over fifty times last year.
Can I also say that this House constantly rushes to introduce regulation.
Can I also welcome, Commissioner, this joint declaration made by you and the Indian Trade Minister, Anand Sharma, on 13 December 2010 stating unequivocally that nothing in the agreement would prevent the poorest from accessing life-saving medicines.
Can I now make some specific requests, firstly on the imminent Gaza Flotilla Mark II? Can you, Madam Vice-President/High Representative, put pressure on Turkey to stop this dangerous provocation at a time when Israel is under enormous tension and pressure, with missile attacks from Gaza and the renewed passage of Iranian warships through the Suez Canal? And how will the EU engage with a new unitary Palestinian Authority that has Hamas, a terrorist organisation banned by the EU, as one of its components?
Can I say to those who have that idea, be very careful, because I have a suspicion that a toolbox without an optional instrument is potentially actually more invasive of national law than a toolbox with an optional instrument that is voluntary, that respects the autonomy of the parties and is not detrimental to national law.
Can I say, too, that we are almost always the first to produce statements, the first to come out and say what we think should happen.
Can the Commission confirm its support for a strong and well resourced common agricultural policy under the next multiannual financial framework?
Can the Commission confirm that an adequately-financed CAP, maintaining the current share of the EU budget, will be a central part of any reform to the multiannual financial framework, in the light of the central role that the common agricultural policy plays in continuing to deliver such public goods?
Can the Commission provide information on consumer awareness of the quality food schemes? How can recognition of the PDO, PGI and TSG labels be improved and made more relevant to consumers, in particular, in Member States that have few registered products?
Can the EU really trust a state that selectively applies international laws? I call upon the EU to monitor the pre-election, election and post-election period very closely and make sure every violation is picked up and pointed out.
Can we really allow ski runs - new ski areas of 1, 2, 3 or 10 hectares which are added on to ski areas or which will be more heavily trafficked as a result of the expansion of existing ski facilities - to be completely disregarded in the calculations? My personal opinion is that, based on the European rules, all the areas to be used should be included in the overall project, hence our specific question to the Commission as to whether it does not feel that we need to tighten up the European regulations in this area.
Can you imagine Hungarian political parties mounting an election campaign in another country? In short, the new Hungarian constitution will lead to the total destabilisation of Central Europe.
Can you really see Syria chairing the UN Human Rights Council?
Canada has agreed to resolve the difference in exchange for a bilateral regulatory dialogue on biotechnology issues. I call on the Commission to defend the high level of protection provided by the European regulatory framework during the course of the negotiations under way.
Canada has also been lobbying Member States, and there has been the threat that Canada will take us to the World Trade Organisation if such an arrangement is introduced.
Canada is a leading world producer of aircraft and aviation equipment.
Canada is an important potential trading partner for the EU, and both parties will profit from such an agreement.
Canada is making a great deal of money out of exploiting its tar sands but it also made commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce its CO2 emissions, and it has reneged on those commitments because of the financial benefits it is getting from tar sands.
Canada is one of our oldest and closest trading partners, currently the 11th biggest, and the potential benefits from deregulating bilateral trade are obvious, including from the study carried out by the Commission and the Canadian Government in October 2008.
Canada is one of the EU's oldest and closest partners, being the first industrialised country with which - in 1976 - the EU signed a Framework Agreement for commercial and economic cooperation.
Canada is one of the EU's oldest and closest partners, being the first industrialised country with which - in 1976 - the EU signed a Framework Agreement for commercial and economic cooperation. A number of bilateral agreements designed to facilitate stronger trade relations have been signed over the years and currently, the EU is Canada's second most important trading partner and Canada's second largest source of foreign direct investment. I agree that that the EU-Canada economic relationship has not yet reached its full potential.
Canada is undoubtedly a trade partner of the EU, but it is imperative that we in Parliament relay the concerns of our fellow citizens located both on European territory and in regions forming part of the European family, namely, the protection and defence of their interests.
Canada, like other states that protect geographical indications under trademarks, is, as we all know, opposed to the demands made by the EU on this point at the Doha Round negotiations.
Cancer is the second most common cause of death in Europe, and due to the fact that the population is ageing, it is expected that one man in three and one woman in four will have direct experience of this disease by the age of 75. Cancer research is on the brink of a number of breakthroughs, especially with regard to more accurate and less expensive methods, and also methods that are less distressing for patients, in relation to both preventative check-ups and actual treatments.
Candidate countries must be able to implement and enforce all the Schengen criteria effectively and correctly: the same criteria that were demanded of previous candidate countries; no more, no less.
Carrying out an independent investigation and bringing those responsible to justice is not a political choice but an obligation under international law.
Cases of young graduates, with additional training and postgraduate training, but without a job and without prospects of finding one, are multiplying in the EU. Training must be geared towards the needs of the market and prepare young workers.
Catherine Ashton has said that the flotilla is not the right response to the situation in Gaza, but the EU's response is to continue to fund, through research grants, the Israeli armaments companies that make the weapons that kill Palestinian civilians.
Caution in politics is no replacement for boldness: they must go hand in hand.
Certainly it reflects an old Irish saying, 'well begun is half done', and it can be done at early childhood level.
Certainly the Parliament in its negotiations has gone more than halfway towards a compromise, but I think we have reached the limit.
Certainly, if the fundamentals are right, there are great opportunities both for the European Union and for Russia in the long term.
Certainly, that was my group's motto in these negotiations. I doubt that the markets and our citizens would believe in speedy but superficial solutions.
Certainly, there is no reason to oppose an exchange of literature, film, music and the like, but the expectations in respect of the Islamic world must not be overly inflated - you only need think of the ban on music, which stems from the Koran.
Certainly, we do not know the causes, but we do know some things that we have to spell out: there has been negligence in political action and negligence by the German Federal Government; it cannot act as if Hamburg were a city state on another continent.
Chair of the INTA Committee.
Changes to systems for monitoring and managing funds, aimed at increasing the effectiveness of their interventions, should be based on a thorough analysis of their current functioning. I also support the view that unused funds should remain in the budget earmarked for cohesion, and not returned to the Member States, and I believe that we need a thorough analysis of the possible consequences of including the European Development Fund in the EU budget, in particular, in light of the EU's obligations to third countries.
Charging an interest rate like the one we are being charged is akin to tying a millstone around the neck of a drowning man while you are sending out the lifeboat to save him.
Charging users for some associated external costs enables Member States to make their national road charging systems more efficient, which means they are better able to manage transport demand.
Chemistry has made possible vaccines and antibiotics that have doubled our life expectancy, and it is key to developing new energy sources and improving food.
Child labour and the organised violation of human rights must not be ignored when trade agreements are under discussion and the EU must take a strong position in promoting social policy and labour and social standards in trade negotiations.
Children in their earliest years are particularly curious, receptive and willing to learn, and important skills such as the ability to speak and express oneself, as well as social skills, are formed at this age.
Children must be fully considered real, active citizens who are able to form and express their own opinions, enjoy certain rights, and who possess their own creative potential.
Children's earliest experiences are the basis for all subsequent learning, conditioning children's development, and helping reverse potential situations of disadvantage and transmission of poverty from generation to generation.
Children's early learning lays the foundations for their successful lifelong learning.
China, in as much as we can involve it, is a fully-fledged member of the Security Council and it would be a great help in finding solutions in the country.
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law can make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market and opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular SMEs, and consumers.
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law can make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market and opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, and consumers.
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law could make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market, and to opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and consumers. I would stress the need for broad and balanced stakeholder involvement.
Choosing the right way forward in the area of contract law could make a significant contribution to improving the functioning of the Internal Market, and to opening up its full potential for businesses, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises, and consumers.
Cities are currently facing various and disparate problems, requiring the implementation of tailored and integrated local development models.
Cities are the fulcrum of social and economic life and possess a fundamental faculty of social integration since, on the one hand, they guarantee the preservation of cultural diversity and, on the other, they maintain a permanent link between the centre and outlying areas.
Citizens also need to be given the means to consult these registers so that they can make meaningful use of the information when trying to understand how we make decisions.
Citizens and enterprises also need to have the right to have such rulings enforced effectively.
Citizens must have easy and unimpeded access in the decision-making process to the influence and activity of interest representatives.
Citizens see many areas where EU legislation impacts on their lives, and so they cannot understand why they are not protected from fraudulent companies. I would ask you, Commissioner, to understand that the word 'urgent' means 'now'.
Citizens, however, become very restless if what is stated on paper is not implemented.
Civil participation and the involvement of civil society, entrepreneurs, researchers, young people and artists are essential to a self-determined society of solidarity.
Clashes in the vicinity of the Church of St. Menas are only the tip of the iceberg with regard to the tragedy of Egyptian Christians and the silence from international organisations.
Clear laws relating to the process of whistleblowing are essential in the fight against corruption.
Clear strategies are needed to facilitate their inclusion in the labour market, which will encourage the correlation between education programmes and the demands of the labour market, so that it can take up the graduates.
Clearly in all this we cannot forget the importance of growth, which brings in internal revenue, and structural reforms to get struggling countries back on their feet.
Clearly, colleagues, there are objective concerns that have been expressed not only by political parties but also by the Venice Commission, and, at the very least, there are ambiguities.
Clearly, every debate on discharge has its own particular context, and the context of today's debate is the economic and financial crisis, which has caused financial and budgetary problems for a number of Member States.
Clearly, every debate on discharge has its own specific context and today's discharge has taken place at a time of economic and financial crisis, which has created both financial and budgetary problems for some Member States.
Clearly, if agriculture is worth less in Europe, then agricultural products and hence all our food is also worth less.
Clearly, one cannot therefore say that the crisis is simply the responsibility of the banks, of enterprises, or of politicians, as some would simplistically have us believe. I believe that this is a collective responsibility and that it would therefore be healthy if everyone contributed their fair share towards tackling the crisis.
Clearly, the aim of the CETA must be fair competition.
Clearly, this does not mean that we should not pursue a policy of controls on and strict monitoring of anything relating to nuclear power.
Climate change and forests are inextricably bound up with each other.
Climate change is threatening European forests, with an increase in forest fires, with diseases passing from one country to another and putting entire species at risk, and with disasters caused by extreme weather conditions.
Climate change means that every type of forest and the forestry sector as a whole are exposed to specific and unforeseeable threats such as storms, drought and forest fires.
Climate change, sustainable transport, nature, biodiversity, the use and exploitation of raw materials and natural resources, as well as waste management, have increased their importance exponentially in the policies of Member States.
Climate targets must be increased to the levels called for by scientists and special programmes must be designed for countries with economic problems.
Close to 400 000 babies are born prematurely annually, yet there is no funding for research in this area.
Closer trade ties between the EU and Canada can only be built on a basis of respect for the wishes of the European public and for European law.
Codification is also a suitable means of developing European Union law which is simpler, clearer and more understandable to citizens.
Codification of the directive on marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs aims to achieve this approach and to simplify consumers' understanding of the legislation.
Cohesion among the different territories of the European Union is a key, strategic objective on which the very future of Europe depends.
Cohesion policy after 2013 should continue to be an important factor in the development of Europe.
Cohesion policy constitutes one of the targets of the EU 2020 strategy and for this reason it is necessary to pay greater attention to the coordination of activities between the EU and the Member States which depend on this sector. I, therefore, voted in favour of this document.
Cohesion policy has always been an essential element of the European Economic Recovery Plan through which the role of Structural Funds becomes clear to everyone.
Cohesion policy has greater potential today than ever before, and this should not be underestimated; it is capable of improving less-developed regions characterised by permanent geographical or natural disadvantages.
Cohesion policy is a fundamental pillar of socio-economic development, and the Member States have received the new requirements positively and are quickly acknowledging the EU's guidelines, making relevant progress in achieving the targets of political cohesion.
Cohesion policy is a key policy for the EU. It is a horizontal policy which, through its instruments par excellence, the Structural Funds, finances projects and programmes in the Member States, seeking to reduce disparities in development levels between the different regions.
Cohesion policy is a pillar of the Europe 2020 strategy, so the money allocated to cohesion policy in the next common financial framework should not be less than the amounts made available in the current programming period.
Cohesion policy is targeted exclusively at investments.
Cohesion policy is vital to an improved socio-economic environment in Europe and is a practical expression of solidarity between the Member States.
Cohesion policy needs to be an effective tool for responding to the socio-economic challenges brought about by the financial crisis and for reducing disparities between the levels of development of European regions.
Cohesion policy not only plays a key role in achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy; its primary task is to strengthen European integration and solidarity by reducing the social, economic and territorial differences that still unfortunately exist within the European Union.
Cohesion policy should also promote transparency.
Cohesion policy should certainly remove the current physical, administrative and regulatory obstacles and reduce the 'border effect' between territories and regions, permitting them to address their shared challenges together, whether these be territorial, global, economic or societal.
Cohesion policy should continue to help the poorest regions catch up and adapt its objectives to present and future challenges, providing smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy.
Collaboration between the private and public sectors must be developed and SMEs encouraged to participate more fully in the programme.
Colleagues who were in the House at the time will recall that we urged the Commission and the Council to build more civil liberties safeguards into the legislation, and we secured from the Commission a commitment to a draft directive on the rights of defendants in criminal legal proceedings.
Colleagues, as you see, we are witnessing a fundamental discussion on the future of Europe and we are waiting for the standpoint of the Commission.
Colourants, gases to increase shelf life, growth hormones, antibiotics, GMOs and much more besides are used - preferably without consumers being able to read about it on the packaging.
Combating illegal fishing, creating jobs, reducing poverty levels in third countries and supplying the EU market with quality products for its consumers are the key objectives that should be guaranteed under this agreement with Mauritania.
Combating youth unemployment is one of the most important challenges facing the EU. In order to address this problem, we need to invest more in the education and training of young people so that they are equipped for future challenges on the labour market, which is becoming more and more demanding.
Coming from Scotland, I am particularly glad to see a strong statement in favour of less favoured areas in paragraph 82. I know that farmers in Scotland - and everywhere else too - will be glad to see paragraph 44, which contains an explicit statement that cross-compliance should be risk-based and proportional.
Coming to the future of the common foreign and security policy, I would like to call for more coherence and consistency when dealing with non-democratic regimes.
Coming up with a viable solution to the sovereign debt crisis and the need to strengthen the euro, return to a path of sustainable growth and create new jobs depend on efficient coordination between Member States and strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact.
Commercial relations between the European Union and Canada can go well beyond the commitments undertaken through the World Trade Organisation as long as they are based on a balanced agreement, a guarantee of proper reciprocal access to each other's markets and improved protection for trademarks, patents and geographical indications.
Commission approval of applications to the Fund in 2011 had to be postponed for the first time because sufficient payment appropriations could not be found quickly. I am sure you will agree that this is not helpful to workers who have been made redundant and need assistance quickly.
Commission representatives on the governing boards of agencies make every effort to ensure that the recommendations stemming from external evaluations, and those from the Court of Auditors and the Commission's internal audit service, are followed up appropriately.
Commissioner Dalli, I know that you are nodding in agreement, and I welcome that, but I do believe that now is the time to set up the crisis unit, and I would like you to comment on that in your closing remarks.
Commissioner Dalli, I want assurance from you here today that absolutely every effort is being made to trace where the source of this E coli outbreak has come from, because until we trace the source, we cannot start the process of rebuilding consumer confidence.
Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn, perhaps you could provide some impetus here to get a tar sands research programme put in place alongside this trade agreement.
Commissioner Malmström correctly emphasises the fact that the free movement of people across European borders is an enormous success and we must not lose it. From this perspective, the Commission proposal for managed immigration flows seems incomprehensible.
Commissioner Malmström, leave Schengen as it is. Re-read the Treaties, re-read Articles 67 and 78. Everything is there.
Commissioner Reding has already told you, and I emphasise the fact, that an extradition order can take up to a year whereas a European Arrest Warrant, on the other hand, must be substantiated within 40 days.
Commissioner Reding should be credited with having had the honesty to confirm that this warrant has had problems and causes doubts, and that there are proportionality tests, which must be passed when warrants are issued and which should not be applied automatically without a judge having a slower, more measured look at them.
Commissioner Rehn has 15 points on his list and it could be that there are some Members who have problems with the detail in this package, but if you look at the alternative offered by the Left, it leaves us even worse off. I therefore hope that, tomorrow, Members will be prepared to rise to the challenge of this very important legislative package for this Parliament, which for the first time in its history is exercising co-legislative powers, just as the Council does.
Commissioner Rehn reported this evening that it has succeeded in reducing the cost of doing business by 22% in some areas and will continue to concentrate on this initiative.
Commissioner, I am, of course, very glad to hear you stress again the importance that you attach to the maintenance of the Schengen area. I know you are very sincere on that, but my worry is that, despite that, people seem to have got the wrong end of the stick and the impression has got abroad - for instance, last week an article in the Financial Times said that 'Schengen as well as the eurozone was disintegrating' - that somehow the Commission is fairly relaxed about the reintroduction of internal border controls.
Commissioner, I ask that you make sure that the EU representatives at the summit in Nizhny Novgorod will give recognition and support to the civil society organisations.
Commissioner, I hope that you will change your mind on this particular decision, and that you will not remain deaf to the political objectives and budgetary intentions thereof which are expressed in this mandate for the trialogue.
Commissioner, I invite you to table a proposal on cloning as soon as possible in order to regulate the sector effectively once and for all.
Commissioner, I still think you can do more for simplification.
Commissioner, I was interested in your words on occupational health and safety and, even though you do not foresee extending the directive, I think your comments leave some scope for flexibility in ensuring better health and safety conditions for domestic workers.
Commissioner, I would like to thank you for remembering, when preparing the joint EU-Russia Summit, all of the agendas that are important for the partnership between the EU and Russia.
Commissioner, I would suggest that you take some of these free days and reallocate them to the implementation of the budget, so that we can actually achieve the political goals we want to achieve. I would ask that we should also be provided with an EU 2020 strategy for the administration of the EU. This would require action not only from you, but also from the entire college and the President of the Commission.
Commissioner, any weakening of the CAP will come up against political opposition from the European Parliament. I think that this is the cross-party message of this House and serious account needs to be taken of it.
Commissioner, as well as technology and geography, you must also ensure that the safety culture and the structure of safety policies are included in the stress test when the proposal is put forward.
Commissioner, as you know, the delivery of public goods and security of food supply comes at a very significant cost.
Commissioner, can you personally offer any explanation of how the proportionality requirements should be interpreted and arrange for this to be taken over by the Council? Can you make sure that people will actually be entitled to challenge an arrest warrant in both the Member State which has issued the warrant and the Member State which is carrying it out? Do you agree that it ought to be possible to consistently refuse to carry out arrest warrants on behalf of countries where conditions in prisons and houses of detention remain inhumane, that the EAW will be subjected to a human rights assessment and that Cor Disselkoen need not fear even more misery?
Commissioner, congratulations for introducing these stress tests, but you should step in to show your disagreement with the position taken by certain Member States, including the United Kingdom and France.
Commissioner, in 1989, the then President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, stated that education and culture should be the soul of Europe.
Commissioner, in my opinion this programme should also be seen as an opportunity, so that we respect and uphold certain fundamental principles through the choices we make.
Commissioner, in the light of Parliament resolutions and the Council conclusions of last December, could you give us your assessment of the progress that has been made since the 2006 Barnier report in setting up a really coherent rapid reaction or disaster response mechanism: one that draws together humanitarian, civil protection and military assets and that has a pre-identified pool of resources from Member States rather than an ad hoc approach? Are we getting our act together? Can you reassure us?
Commissioner, in the meeting that we had on the day before your meeting with the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG), my group explained to you what our position on this question was.
Commissioner, is it not true that we have, or soon will have, EU laws which prohibit the placing on the market of products from seals, of dog and cat fur, and of cosmetics which are tested on animals? We have those laws, so why can we not have a law which prohibits the placing on the EU market of products which result from the cruel practice of cloning?
Commissioner, just like you, we want to stick to the procedure ensuring that this entire process is conducted correctly, and we await the final opinion of the Venice Commission, although it is now clear from the preliminary conclusions presented in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs by the Secretary of the Venice Commission, Mr Markert, that the current Hungarian constitution is, in a number of points, controversial to say the least.
Commissioner, knowing your attachment to Europe, I believe that you will agree with me that the solutions we are debating today, the way in which we shall manage this crisis, will no doubt be a major chapter in European history.
Commissioner, now would be the time to enhance our ethical commitment to assist the ILO, to help ourselves, and to perform work which is worthy for the future of humanity.
Commissioner, on behalf of the entire Parliament, I would like to thank you for agreeing to conduct this debate in the run-up to this conference.
Commissioner, this is a matter of the utmost importance.
Commissioner, this is, without doubt, the top priority at the stress test stage; however, I would also point out that, in the second stage, full and fundamental preventive supervision will need to include appropriate mechanisms to address what, to date, has been a particularly shadowy banking sector.
Commissioner, traceability to the origin worked, but how much time was lost in directing attention to the origin, focusing on agricultural production, whereas other forms of contamination, such as handling or distribution at the point of destination, were dismissed? Why did the Commission echo the hurried information from Germany?
Commissioner, we are all looking forward to your communication in October and then to good, positive cooperation.
Commissioner, we support you in your approach of bringing more ecology and more greening into the first pillar.
Commissioner, why is it that only spending on pensions can be given special treatment in your assessment of Member States' medium-term budget objectives? Why is it that this special treatment cannot also be given to the investment in the future represented by spending on education, or the spending we need to undertake to combat social exclusion, a goal that you set and that we included in the Europe 2020 strategy? Why is it that these aims and this kind of approach are not also applied to spending on research and development or infrastructures?
Commissioner, would you consider an area-based response to youth employment problems? You will find that it is people with the lowest level of education, perhaps living in local authority complexes, lacking access to education and on social welfare who have the highest levels of unemployment.
Commissioner, you have just said it yourself: this is a sector with a major potential for our economy and employment, which is why we must take specific, stimulating measures, such as reducing the tax on online projects, because the current system, certainly the VAT rate, is out of step with the times and is absolutely unfair.
Commissioner, you have promised that we will look into whether stricter conditions can be introduced by the next financial perspective in 2014.
Commissioner, you say that plausible possibilities should be taken into account, and so we are not taking into account the possibility of a sovereign State defaulting in Europe. I would therefore like to make the following point: either you regard this as a possibility to be rejected, and if so I would say to you that you are in denial, because the figures of the Greek debt and the Irish debt clearly show that, sooner or later, those States are going to have to restructure their debt, or you are playing for time, and if so I would say to you that that is equally irresponsible, because the longer it takes to tackle the issue, the more it will cost society as a whole. I therefore appeal to your sense of reality and responsibility in this matter, Commissioner.
Commissioners, President-in-Office of the Council, are you aware of what happened in Paris? In Paris, some young Tunisians who had an Italian residency permit heard the French police say to them: 'This is what we are going to do with your permits', before tearing them up in front of them.
Commitment to education and training to improve young Europeans' qualifications is a key objective of the Europe 2020 strategy, and an instrument that I consider essential to combating unemployment and encouraging entrepreneurship. I therefore welcome the Youth on the Move initiative, in particular, its aspect of supporting and encouraging student mobility, and of recognising qualifications, as well as the importance ascribed to non-formal and informal education, which are often as important as formal learning or even more so.
Commitment to the EU's principles of equality and solidarity should end the existence of different standards and also prejudices in decision making.
Compared to our global ambitions, what is needed here is a small step.
Compared to the BRIC countries, the EU invests more, with the differential having decreased for Brazil and China, and increased for India and Russia.
Compliance with competition law in the field of energy, without the granting of any exemptions, is also a very important matter for the European Parliament.
Composition of political groups: see Minutes
Comprehensive agreements with neighbouring countries or significant global partners can provide substantial benefits by offering passengers and freight operators improved services - in terms of both variety and cost - while allowing airlines new opportunities and a competitive edge.
Comprehensive air agreements with neighbouring countries or significant global partners can deliver benefits not only to freight operators and airlines, but also to passengers.
Comprehensive air agreements with neighbouring countries or significant global partners can deliver substantial benefits to passengers, freight operators and airlines, by means of both market access and regulatory convergence to promote fair competition, including issues with regard to state subsidies and social and environmental standards. I agree with the rapporteur that Parliament needs to follow the process from the very beginning and be closely involved in the topics under discussion to discover the current state of the negotiations on air agreements.
Concerning Mr Zver's Youth on the Move initiative, it is very probably true that this mobility programme has proven to be a success story, and his report, to its credit, goes a lot deeper into the matter. I believe that it could lead to many success stories being documented in European history and on the subject of youth in the future.
Concerning prison conditions: the Member States are under a general obligation to ensure that prison conditions are in accordance with the basic tenets of human dignity and do not violate the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment laid down in Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
Concerning the GIs, the high level of protection is an important objective in this negotiation and it has taken quite some time and effort with India to come to a common approach.
Concerning the issue of red tape, this will not create a new burden for enterprises because we are using existing administrative and statistical data.
Concerning the question on health and safety legislation and how it applies to domestic workers, the Commission at this moment does not plan to extend the scope of the Health and Safety Directive but we now have an opportunity to think about new rules on domestic workers as a group.
Concerns were raised about the potential risk to the independence of experts and also potential problems with staff recruitment.
Conciliation proceedings are most certainly a useful mechanism in the legislative process, but they become futile and pointless if participants are not prepared to negotiate and to compromise.
Conclusion number one reads: 'in considering the direct causes of the Fukushima accident, we see no reason for curtailing the operation of nuclear power plants or other nuclear facilities in the UK'. Conclusion two reads: 'in response to the Fukushima accident, the UK nuclear power industry has reacted responsibly and appropriately, displaying leadership for safety and a strong safety culture in its response to date'. Conclusion four reads: 'to date, the consideration of the known circumstances of the Fukushima accident has not revealed any gaps in scope or depth of the safety assessment principles for nuclear facilities in the UK'.
Conclusions like this flow directly from the Albertini report, which notes a lack of will on the part of Member States to conduct a common policy and the statements of some representatives of those Member States which have created the impression of disunity.
Conditionality will help us to improve the quality of our work. A lot has been said today about the transitional regions, most of it proper and important.
Confident that the Council will confirm Parliament's vote in favour, I guarantee Mario Draghi, in my capacity as a member of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the utmost readiness to take part in a fruitful collaboration with the ECB, particularly at this time of difficulty for the euro and the EU.
Confronted with a global economy which is in crisis, the European Parliament has stressed the importance of making Europe more innovative and efficient by adapting to the new challenges of the 21st century.
Congratulations once again, Mr Coelho, and congratulations to Romania and Bulgaria.
Consensus was also reached on the issue of transparency, since I support the idea to oblige all registered rating agencies to conduct an annual review to assess their past credit rating performances, with this information then being passed on to the supervisor.
Consequently, I appeal to you, Commissioner, to ensure that, in the forthcoming financial period, both regional policy and agricultural policy maintain their existing budget levels, in accordance with Parliament's opinion. I am, moreover, glad that the report also gives consideration to regions where conditions are especially tough, such as the sparsely populated areas of the north.
Consequently, I hope that tomorrow's vote will be favourable and that all those who claim to be in favour of Eurosecurities will discuss the issue in a spirit of open-mindedness rather than based on ideological prejudices.
Consequently, I think that we need to ensure at the moment in Europe that there is a greater distribution of creative works and free access is provided to them online without, however, ignoring the fact that the artists and their works must be protected and receive fair remuneration.
Consequently, I welcome the call by our Chamber to introduce greater flexibility in the de minimis subsidy scheme.
Consequently, all labour market players, including those from the professional sectors, businesses, trade unions, ministries and public employment services, should engage in a structured dialogue on how to guarantee professional integration of the young, promote formal/informal training and ultimately develop an education system in the EU which is able to provide career security for our young people.
Consequently, consumers are also disadvantaged by limited product choice, higher prices and lower quality due to weak cross-border competition.
Consequently, greater attention must be focused on protecting workers' rights and labour legislation. A significant improvement needs to be made to the legal and social position of women to prevent discrimination and utilise the potential contribution from women to economic and social development. I call on the Commission and Member States to enforce the right not to be discriminated against, which means the right to work and equal treatment, irrespective of gender, ethnic origin, age and disability, as a key principle in the fight against poverty.
Consequently, it is crucial to continue adopting an approach that protects these services, particularly by protecting them from international competition.
Consequently, it is very important to obtain accurate data and information on drugs and drug addiction, because these are global phenomena, posing a threat to the health, security and social well-being of us all. I support Croatia's participation in the activities of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.
Consequently, later on, some of these young people are neither employed nor in education or training. I understand the Commission's efforts to encourage the Member States to exchange examples of good policy and practice, making use of the open method of coordination, but it would be much more useful and effective to draft and adopt common quality criteria.
Consequently, new indicators need to be developed, which is precisely what Mrs Rosbach's report does. I consider that GDP is a limited indicator and that indicators should be developed to supplement it. The report addresses the above issues, which I consider to be very important and in need of immediate resolution, which is why I voted in favour of this particular report.
Consequently, so as to be able to finance the actions linked to the EU's new competences under the Treaty of Lisbon, I am supporting the request for the question of own resources to be examined and for new forms of Community income, in order to ease the pressure on national budgets and to do away with the belief in a 'fair return' which is economically inaccurate and politically unsound.
Consequently, some of the key questions arising from this debate are whether policies on the arms trade will finally be changed, and what exactly is going to be done to put an end to the expansionist and warmongering policies of Israel ...
Consequently, the Commission should consider the possibility of establishing a completely new, independent European Credit Rating Foundation (ECRF), which would have the right to participate in decisions on sovereign debt ratings and credit rating agencies.
Consequently, the common register is a first and important step in controlling and safeguarding transparent action by interest groups.
Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 2003/37/EC relating to agricultural and forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units, apply to this directive.
Consequently, the provisions laid down in Directive 2003/37/EC relating to agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units, apply to this directive.
Consequently, the report draws attention to the need to modernise both initial and continuing vocational education and training, proposes concluding basic education with a career aptitude assessment and stresses the importance of initial training for teachers.
Consequently, the rules of the game have been modified during the match, to the disadvantage of the two players. I personally support the positive conclusions of the report and praise the author for them but, although I can understand the political reasons for amending the recommendation - the basis of politics is, after all, compromise - I cannot ignore the fact that the new conditionality suggested might facilitate a subjective interpretation of it. I pray to God that I am wrong.
Consequently, there is no longer any reason why they cannot integrate into this area of free movement. I would find it unacceptable if certain States, under false pretexts and motivated by internal political calculation, continued to oppose it. The Community acquis should not be regarded as an à la carte system where Member States can adapt or suspend provisions as circumstances dictate.
Consequently, they are unable to start a life on their own and often become an unbearable burden on households, creating a vicious circle of unsatisfactory education and joblessness.
Consequently, this own-initiative report by Parliament should form the basis for future discussions, even if, in my view, it does err on the side of consensus and caution.
Consequently, those wild species that naturally colonise these special habitats that the forest provides merit particular attention from forest owners as they contribute to preserving biodiversity.
Consequently, we need to improve the quality of transportation services, creating favourable conditions for cash-in-transit companies to provide services quickly and efficiently.
Consider this: only a year ago, the euro area Member States agreed on a conditional loan package to Greece in order to prevent a meltdown of our financial system.
Considering recent developments, it would be wrong to say that the debt crisis is no longer a burden for the European economy, yet it would be equally wrong to claim that the EU has not responded to the crisis.
Considering that the territorial cooperation has proved its effectiveness in promoting the harmonious development of the Union as a whole, it's now fundamental to increase its budget from the actual 2.5% to at least the 7% of the overall cohesion policy resources for the next programming period.
Considering the high added value that the GNSS and Galileo projects generate for EU industrial policy, it is essential to ensure their success. A targeted action plan is the best way of giving fresh impetus and contributing significantly to targets on safety and the environment as well as to those on traffic flow improvement for road transport.
Considering the numerous political and economic changes that have taken place since the Seventh Framework Programme was adopted, it is necessary to amend FP7 to reflect the situation of the new reality.
Considering the significant economic returns from such programmes, I voted in favour of the Remek report which calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure sufficient funding in order to make sure these projects are completed by 2018, thus asserting themselves as credible challengers to the American system.
Consistency, credibility and strong, decisive, single-minded use of the budget as a fundamental instrument for fighting the crisis and compensating for Member States' consolidation policies - these are all issues that require a serious commitment on our part, that must truly ensure we once again play a crucial role in the security of the European Union, and above all - and this is my major concern - that invite us not to waste the opportunity of the trialogue.
Consistency, credibility and the ambitious Europe 2020 strategy therefore also become decisive and fundamental in guaranteeing the stability we need today within the European Union, as well as with regard to our single currency.
Consumer protection being a complex issue, an approach reflecting all of the above was needed from the outset.
Consumer rights (final vote) (
Consumer rights and protection under EU law is one of the fundamental principles of the functioning of the internal market. I believe adequate consumer protection and security are fundamental to the proper functioning of the markets and to trade, which constitute an essential condition of competitiveness and growth.
Consumer rights are of critical importance to the effective functioning of the single market. I voted in favour of the report because it proposes measures that will ensure that there is protection for consumers everywhere in the Union.
Consumer rights require continuous care, both in the area of legislation, including the scope of regulation, the subject of regulation and the obligations and rights of the parties, and also in the area of the observance of these rights.
Consumers benefit where labels contain information about materials that pose a health hazard or that cause allergic reactions.
Consumers can still find cloned products on their dinner tables, unsolicited and unlabelled, even though 77% of European citizens are opposed to this. I would say to the Council that banning clones alone is the politics of symbolism.
Consumers have no confidence in cross-border commerce and companies face huge administrative and legal difficulties if they want to expand their activities in other EU Member States.
Consumers must be provided with accurate information on the presence of non-textile animal-derived products, such as fur, so that they can make informed choices.
Consumers very often complain that their right to benefit from all the privileges of the single market is incomplete, and this is reflected in the lack of trust in online transactions and in the feeling of legal uncertainty concerning the scope of the protection which should be enjoyed by consumers.
Consumers will be better informed on contract terms and conditions of sale, as well as on delivery times and the possibility of withdrawing from the contract. I have in mind, for example, the period for a refund in the case of returned goods, which will be considerably reduced, providing a guarantee to the consumer from a financial point of view as well, and the right to reconsider, which will be extended to 14 days.
Consumers will gain through more affordable purchases and enhanced access to high-quality services.
Consumers will no longer run the risk of buying textile products that are potentially harmful to their health perhaps because they have been treated with chemical agents.
Contemporaneously, it will promote political dialogue on necessary reforms which aim to strengthen the cooperation between the two parties, by supporting a partnership framework in which to develop a sustainable fisheries policy and responsible exploitation of fishery resources in the Seychelles' fishing zone.
Continuing with old programmes and designing new programmes has to be given in-depth scrutiny.
Contract law determines and organises transactions within the Internal Market; its potential for both hindering and facilitating those transactions is therefore obvious.
Contracts are the fundamental links in relationships between companies and consumers.
Contrary to all the proclamations of solidarity at election propaganda time, what we have is a policy of social regression and of prolonged economic recession.
Contrary to international law, according to which the promotion and protection of a national minority is the responsibility of the State in which that minority lives, this constitution also stipulates that Hungary is responsible for the fate of Hungarians abroad.
Conversely, I cannot share the guidelines of Mrs Sanchez-Schmid's report on cultural industries, since these guidelines would introduce a commercial rationale, subject to market forces, to cultural goods.
Conversely, like numerous consumer associations, I deplore the fact that options have been provided so that Member States can bypass certain provisions in the directive with commercial or sector interests in mind.
Conversely, the European Union wishes to create proximity where history had created distance, misunderstanding and sometimes hatred.
Cooperating in order to improve vocational education and training means reducing the youth unemployment rate, equipping workers with cognitive tools and providing greater and simplified funding opportunities.
Cooperation between the Commission and Parliament is essential, not only for a good start in shaping the proposal, but also for a happy end to the negotiations which are extremely difficult in the present context.
Cooperation between the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control, of which I am a member, is excellent, and this cooperation has produced certain recommendations on how the European Parliament should vote when granting discharge.
Cooperation between the various institutes and learning in the various disciplines, which are taught differently in the various countries depending also on the political awareness of the ruling classes, also represents a key contribution to the definition of a European identity.
Cooperation in this area will help to establish dialogue with societies from different cultures. I am also a supporter of what is called 'brand Europe', and the development and promotion of this, in such areas as support for talent, tourism and the propagation of universal values, for example, should be based on closer collaboration between the EU's Member States.
Cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy (short presentation) 
Cooperation with Parliament has been very positive so far, and we trust that we can count on Parliament's support for the next steps.
Coordinating EU funding and actions is clearly a better way for us to achieve our common goals, as opposed to individual actions.
Coordination and clear lines of information and communication remain the core of our ability to be effective in such situations.
Coordination within the European Parliament is key, as is coordination with the European Commission and the newly established External Action Service.
Core assessments have been made on the implementation of the programmes, while taking into account for the purposes of comparative analysis differences of several months, because such differences could influence the volume of allocations made to a particular sector.
Core assessments have similarly been made on the strategic reporting exercise, which provides timely evidence of the progress of implementation throughout the whole of Europe, offering a basis for high-level debate, peer review, policy learning and an incentive to improve the quality of performance, even if there are certain limitations in these reports.
Core labour standards are embedded in the eight ILO conventions that focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation and the abolition of child labour.

Corporate social responsibility is only useful as a voluntary exercise if consumers are given reliable and accurate information on the activities of companies, the origin of products and the conditions under which goods are produced and sold.
Corporate social responsibility must be the main aspect of the European social model, in a bid to boost innovation and competitiveness and contribute to employability and job creation, at a time when unemployment rates are increasing drastically and young Europeans, our sustainable force, are looking for alternatives outside the borders of Europe.
Corruption and organised crime are still rife in these countries which are also portals for illegal immigration.
Costs are not apportioned for all the deleterious consequences caused, only for a small number of factors.
Could I just remind her that the South Asia delegation has just been to Sri Lanka - and I see several members of that delegation in the Chamber.
Could I perhaps ask Mr Szájer to reply, on behalf of the EPP Group, whether that means that, from now on, Hungary and the other countries represented will also recognise the Dutch marriage law that allows same-sex couples to get married?
Could it be that someone is intent on getting their hands on the national assets of Belarus? Is not this the reason for this country being randomly selected, especially in view of the fact that you are threatening to use sanctions against its national assets and state-owned companies?
Could not Europe also lend Greece a hand on this matter? Greek accounts are held in banks in Austria, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Switzerland.
Could the Commission envisage carrying out some publicity work to encourage EU citizens to take their hazardous waste to specific places in the Member States? It is extremely important to make our citizens aware of the problem, because without their help in the struggle to manage hazardous waste we will get nowhere.
Could you explain to me and to my electorate how it is possible to instigate common policy in important areas, such as international relations and security, without consensus, unless we dispense with the democratic rights of Member States to project their own aspirations unilaterally?
Could you explain to me why taxpayers should fund political parties at any level? Maybe you could explain to me how useful they are for the EU's aims.
Council Directive 76/432/EEC of 6 April 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the braking devices of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors has been substantially amended several times.
Council Directive 80/720/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the States relating to the operating space, access to the driving position and the doors and windows of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors has been substantially amended.
Council Directive 87/402/EEC of 25 June 1987 on roll-over protection structures mounted in front of the driver's seat on narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors has been substantially amended several times.
Council representatives, including the Secretary General, did not accept a single invitation from the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control to discuss the Council's expenditure in 2009.
Countless factors have a bearing on this growth, which is not unconnected to the deepening of the crisis of capitalism and its social effects in many countries.
Countries joining the Schengen area must continue to comply with all security requirements because the security of the Schengen area really depends on the rigour and effectiveness with which each Member State carries out controls at its external borders, as well as on the quality and speed with which information is exchanged through the Schengen Information Service.
Countries like Portugal are drifting ever further from the promised economic and social development that would move them closer to the EU average.
Countries that fail to meet the obligations in the preventive and corrective part of the Stability and Growth Pact may be subject, unless they take appropriate measures (the suitability of which will be decided by the Council) and present a rebalancing plan, to the application of financial sanctions equal to 0.1% of GDP.
Country of origin must be indicated, and I would definitely support even the indication of the EU Member State, trusting the wisdom of costumers who support their own economies, as everyone will see, say, a Bulgarian, a Czech, a Hungarian or a German person, that they are buying a product manufactured in their own country.
Coupled with the 'one in, one out' policy for regulation that my own government is operating, these measures should begin to achieve our objective.
Covering the period between 2007 and 2013, the EU has at its disposal a budget of almost EUR 17 billion to combat poverty, to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals and to promote democratic governance in developing countries.
Creating a European statute for artists, introducing a reduced VAT rate for cultural goods and improving the distribution of legal digital offers are appropriate and essential measures for ensuring the international cultural influence of the European Union.
Creating a common register is useful for lobbyists too, as they only need to register once.
Creating a secure future for our young people is a subject close to my heart.
Creativeness that is undermined is creativeness that is doomed to disappear.
Creators and inventors would not be able to receive fair remuneration and they would gradually disappear.
Credible and reliable military systems and capabilities are an essential condition for the development of an independent security and defence policy. I believe, however, that a common political will needs to be adopted over the long term in order to strengthen the EU's ability to respond to crises, while safeguarding its strategic independence.
Credit institutions have to a certain extent provided what we call, in French law, a form of unfair assistance to an over-indebted structure.
Credit rating agencies (CRAs) are information middlemen that promote liquidity and transparency in the market by reducing asymmetries in information in the capital markets and facilitating access to the global market, and by reducing the cost of information and making use of the potential of creditors and investors.
Credit rating agencies (CRAs) fulfil several useful purposes: they aggregate information on the credit quality of issuers, enabling issuers to access global and domestic markets, reducing information costs and widening the potential pool of investors, thus providing markets with liquidity.
Credit rating agencies (CRAs) provide ratings for three different sectors - the public sector, companies and structured finance instruments - and played a significant role in the path that led to the financial crisis, through the assignment of faulty ratings to structured finance instruments, which had to be downgraded on average three to four notches during the crisis.
Credit rating agencies (short presentation) 
Credit rating agencies must accept responsibility for what they actually do, and therefore I believe that we should make them liable, obviously not for the rating as such, but for failures and negligence in their work.
Credit rating agencies were earning fees, from financial institutions, for awarding ratings on their products, and from the resulting business of selling those products.
Crime, and organised crime in particular, has never been held back by borders or border controls.
Criminals are now communicating with one another via the Internet, rather than by mobile phone, which had been the method of choice until recently.
Criteria such as employment will therefore be taken into account when we define the ceilings for agricultural income aid.
Croatia asked to join the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in 2005.
Croatia continues to be located on one of the main trafficking routes for drugs into the EU. We are certainly in favour of the government's adoption of a national programme for preventing drug use among young people, with the aim of updating the existing programmes.
Croatia does, however, need to step up the fight against drug trafficking on its territory as this continues to be one of the main routes for drug trafficking into the EU.
Croatia is a transit route through which illegal drugs are smuggled on the way from production countries to consumer countries.
Croatia is situated on one of the main trafficking routes for drugs into the EU. Its participation in the work programme of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction will provide the European Union with factual information on drug trafficking and use in Croatia, and will enable Croatia to understand the scale of its drug-related problems and adopt best practice to deal with them.
Croatia is, in fact, on one of the sea transit routes commonly used by organised crime to bring illegal drugs from producing countries to consuming countries.
Croatia straddles the transit route through which drugs are illegally smuggled from producer countries to consumer countries.
Croatia will be linked to the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction (REITOX) and will share data with the EMCDDA, subject to the data protection requirements of the Union and national law.
Croatia, as a candidate country for EU membership, has a duty to adapt its legal system to the system which is in force in the countries of the Union. I think that Croatia's participation in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is extremely important, particularly because Croatia is a transit route.
Cross border selling will become easier, helping both consumers and traders alike.
Crucial elements in that policy would be support for the work of the UN and a clarification of the EU's policy with regard to the UN.
Crucially, the European Union must step up its strategy to combat those phenomena which harm the forest, such as forest fires and atmospheric pollution.
Cultivation of GM crops should be the decision of individual Member States.
Cultural and creative industries (CCIs) should be at the centre of a new European policy agenda, in line with the economic needs of the sector and measures aimed at adapting to innovations in the digital age. I agree that in order to increase this sector's potential, the European Digital Agenda initiative must be implemented successfully in order to enable European CCIs to benefit fully from, and to adapt successfully to, all the opportunities created by far-reaching, high-speed broadband and by new wireless technologies.
Cultural and creative industries are currently also important drivers of economic and social innovation in many other sectors.
Cultural and creative industries are not only a source of wealth and employment but also contribute to Europe's social and cultural fabric.
Cultural diplomacy has an important role to play when it comes to building successful relations with third countries and, in many countries, there is a network of national institutes for culture, EUNIC, that we can make use of. There are many, many people who have linked in to the network and stand ready to help.
Cultural identity, values and the EU's position on the global stage are intertwined.
Cultural policy also allows the EU to connect with other countries with which no other form of partnership has been agreed on. Support for the cultural dimension in those countries in North Africa which are now building a new, more democratic society is also especially important.
Culture contributes to the fight against poverty and marginalisation, and plays a part in strengthening and preserving the common European spirit and heritage.
Culture equally has economic value: Europe's cultural industries contribute to European entrepreneurship, innovation and business and the EU's diverse cultural landscape makes it the most attractive global tourist destination in the world. A vibrant cultural climate makes living in the EU attractive for businesses and people alike. A coherent, coordinated EU strategy on culture in the EU's external actions does not currently exist and needs to be developed.
Culture is a vector of openness and a motor of democracies, counteracting every nationalist reaction, racist temptation and exclusion.
Culture is a vector of openness and a motor of democracies, counteracting every nationalist reaction, racist temptation and the exclusions that are nourished by the economic and financial, and climate and food crises.
Culture is the basis of everything, the basis of the future for the European Union as a whole, and that is why it is important to ensure that it is acknowledged, not just in the light of GDP, but as a value in itself, both for people and societies, and, ultimately, for the entire European Union.
Culture plays a role in bilateral agreements on development and trade, and through measures such as the European instruments for Development Cooperation, for Stability, for Democracy and Human Rights and for Pre-Accession, the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), the Eastern Partnership, the Union for the Mediterranean and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), which mostly allocate resources to various cultural programmes. I agree that there is a need to strengthen cultural and educational exchanges with third countries, which would strengthen civil society, foster democratisation and good governance, promote human rights and fundamental freedoms and provide building blocks for lasting cooperation.
Culture plays an extremely important role in the European Union, which is an area aiming to be 'united in diversity'. First of all, we should stress its undeniable integrationist aspect, which enables the existence of shared areas: that is, points at which people with different cultural perspectives find themselves with shared representation.
Culture should be a vital and horizontally integrated element among the broad spectrum of external policies which make up the EU's foreign policy: from the EU's trade relations to its enlargement and neighbourhood policy, to its development cooperation policy and its common foreign and security policy.
Culture should play a unifying role externally as well as internally, and therefore, in the relations of the Secretariat for Economic Monitoring (SEAE), European culture could be the standard-bearer of European values, which, through dialogue with cultures outside Europe, should contribute to peaceful cooperation and constructive understanding between peoples.
Culture, identity, values and the EU's position on the global stage are intertwined.
Cultures have a calling to enrich one another in a spirit of mutual respect.
Curb indebtedness by constitutional methods to prevent another Greek, Irish, or Portuguese crisis from happening. I suggest you protect with constitutional methods the rights of future generations, just as the new Hungarian constitution does, raising environmental, budgetary, and demographic sustainability to the level of constitutional principles.
Current environmental conditions are responsible for bringing about changes in European forests.
Current events show that the European Stability and Growth Pact is not very efficient and has failed to prevent several Member States from encountering serious problems in their balance of payments and in paying off their debt.
Current signals from Geneva have not been positive, and the Commissioner admitted not so long ago that the negotiations were in dire straits.
Current unemployment levels, particularly among young people, are worrying and more needs to be done to ensure that young people are able to gain vital skills and qualifications. I strongly believe that the ESF has a valuable role to play in training and educating people.
Currently, Irish bodies receive about €1 million a week from EU research funds, and other opportunities remain for Irish small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It is the SMEs that create 70% of the jobs in the euro area, and the SME sector is at the heart of the European economy.
Currently, free movement is guaranteed on a territory with 42 673 km of external sea and 7 721 km of land borders, covering 25 countries and 400 million citizens.
Currently, the UK contribution is GBP 6.4 billion, rising to over GBP 10 billion if the rebate goes.
Currently, there are 2 million people employed by the forestry sector in the EU, mostly in small and medium-sized enterprises, and the sector earns €300 billion per year.
Currently, too many young people are dropping out of school too early and not enough are taking advantage of higher education.
Cutting expenses hurts, but remains the only way back to growth and stability.
Cutting funds for culture and education at times of crisis - as my country is doing, on the grounds that culture is not essential to survival - means failing to invest in the future and in smart, inclusive growth; it means failing to understand that culture is essential for life.
Cutting the resources from existing programmes will not replace the need for additional new resources if we want to set new objectives for the European Union, if we want European integration to provide real added value, including for taxpayers, who rightly watch every penny allocated to the European budget.
Cybercrime is becoming a volume crime.
Cybercrime is indeed a growing menace.
Data available to date illustrate that - roughly - a mere 2.7% of European GDP will be channelled into research at the end of the decade, despite the Member States' clear commitment to spend at least 3% for that purpose.
Data provided by the Polish Ministry of Education show that in Poland, there are 8 400 public nursery schools and 1 600 private ones, and that there are around 1.6 million children aged from three to six years.
Data supplied by Eurobarometer and gathered by Coldiretti in Italy show that in a food emergency, 43% of Italians, for example, avoid the foods they have heard about for a certain length of time, whereas 13% cut them out of their diet for good.
Dear Mr. President, I voted in favour of this report because it insists on the fact that the framework for preventing and correcting macroeconomic imbalances should complement a Union strategy for growth and jobs aimed at boosting the Union's competitiveness and social stability.
Dear Mr. President, I voted in favour of this report because it stresses that the European territorial cooperation, with its significant contribution to the multi-level governance model, is one of the pillars of the cohesion policy.
Dear President, I abstained on the vote on the Wortmann-Kool and the Feio reports which look to revise the Stability and Growth Pact. I am glad that the reports are strong on the need to avoid debts and deficits, and they have certainly been drafted according to an economic philosophy that I support.
Dear colleagues, I believe that on the basis of the overwhelming majority of positive comments and evaluations in this Chamber today by Members of Parliament, as well as the evaluations of the Commission and of Council, warm congratulations are due to Bulgaria and Romania.
Dear colleagues, I would like to thank you all for your attention and solidarity, which the nations of the Baltic countries have been looking forward to for so many years.
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law(debate) 
Debt restructuring would cut Greece's access to financial markets for a very long time, and the goal of the EU/IMF programme is indeed a relatively rapid return to the markets to finance the Greek sovereign debt so that European taxpayers do not have to guarantee loans to do that.
Decisions on the best way to handle such situations should be taken at European Union level, avoiding unilateral action by Member States.
Decisive action must also be taken against the various forms of fraud aimed at consumers. I see this petition as a step in the right direction, which should be followed by further measures, and, therefore, I have voted in favour of it.
Declarative statements by President Medvedev are neither a proof nor a guarantee of real progress. I would like to remind you that whilst Russia is trying to join the WTO, it disregards, according to suitability, different international obligations, especially regarding human rights.
Declare that the Assad family will never be considered by the European Union as the real representatives of the Syrian people, and that they will be accountable for their crimes.
Defence policy is one of the areas most jealously guarded by the Member States.
Deficits and sustainable growth cannot go hand in hand.
Demanding budget increases in this difficult situation is out-of-touch and scandalous.
Democracy is about being able to say bye-bye as well as hello, and that is important: knowing that you have the right to use your ballot box, once, twice, three times, four times to change your government, to demand of your government, is critical, and you can only do that when democracy is deep and flourishing.
Democracy is based on people's freely expressed desire. I call on the Council and Commission to urge the authorities in Azerbaijan to respect human rights, especially those relating to the freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration, as well as to take concrete measures to combat corruption and reform the justice system.
Democracy matters for the whole of Europe so, yes, I do believe that we are seeing a Sovietisation of Europe.
Deplorably enough, however, in the joint motion for a resolution, we do not find a single word of condemnation of the United States authorities or of the European countries that were complicit with them in this activity.
Deportations in Europe reached a peak, in particular, in the middle of the century as a result of the Nazi regime and the Communist regime of the Soviet Union.
Despite a certain timidity and arrogance on the part of the Council with regard to this crisis, I believe we need to show this cohesion.
Despite a series of hindrances - such as the economic crisis, the persistent inability to close the gap with the United States and increasing competition from emerging countries - the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) has proved that it can offer added value to European research and development. FP7 is a chance for the European Union to make its research policy match its economic and social ambitions, particularly by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA). Looking at Mr Audy's report, I agree on the objectives highlighted in the mid-term review, particularly with regard to the simplification of administrative procedures, the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises through the Cooperation programme, and revamping and intensifying the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility.
Despite all the more or less sentimental constructions that we might make, the truth is that it is by analysing gross domestic product (GDP) that we can achieve a reliable image of societies' state of development and progress.
Despite already being the object of resolutions of this Parliament, the last of which was in 2010, the old request that the country of origin be marked and that information be made available about the origin of various goods has been postponed, which we regret.
Despite already being the object of resolutions of this Parliament, the last of which was in 2010, the old request that the country of origin be marked and that information be made available about the origin of various goods has been postponed.
Despite having a few doubts about the excessive reach of the text - which falls within the ambit of the Europe 2020 strategy - I think the objectives of the resolution are most welcome. I therefore voted in favour of Mr Coelho's report on verifying the necessary conditions for the application of the Schengen acquis, which is a prerequisite for the abolition of internal border controls with Bulgaria and Romania.
Despite important aspects, which we acknowledge, such as the refusal to cut the CAP's overall budget or the proposal to keep planting rights in the wine sector, the report's content is profoundly negative, advocating a CAP whose consequences constitute a very clear step towards the decline and destruction of Portuguese agriculture.
Despite low tariffs, I think it is quite clear that bilateral trade volumes between the EU and Japan lag behind the bulk of the EU's trade partnerships with its other main trading partners. I think this is mostly due to the non-tariff barriers.
Despite some initial difficulties, it was possible for the three European institutions to come to an understanding, which amounts to a very satisfactory result.
Despite the Court of Auditors stating that the agency's accounts are reliable, and the fact that the agency effectively coordinated the network of agencies during the process of discharging the budget for the financial year 2009, the rapporteur singled out that it had not provided sufficient information for comparing actions carried out with subsequent years. I deem such information relevant and there should be an accompanying table annexed to the next report by the Court of Auditors, as is suggested.
Despite the commendable efforts of the Swedish and Belgian presidencies, the Member States have not managed to reach agreement to this day. I can assure the honourable Members that the Hungarian Presidency is striving to find the way to progress with regard to the particularly problematic issues of this proposal and will continue to do all it can to bring the matter to a successful conclusion.
Despite the creation of the financial instruments developed by the Commission and the European Investment Bank (EIB), such as the Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (Jeremie), Joint Assistance to Support Projects in European Regions (Jaspers) and Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas (Jessica), and the other Structural Funds, the results have fallen short of expectations. I therefore agree with the rapporteur's recommendations on the preparation of comprehensive and integrated financial planning so that the funds can be allocated to projects aimed at achieving the objectives set out in the Europe 2020 strategy, rather than to actions that merely consume these same funds.
Despite the decree issued by the President in March of this year in which he officially authorised a longer stay in Guantánamo for some prisoners, the Union hopes - no, in fact, expects - the government of the United States to continue to discuss this subject in Congress and to work towards closing the detention camp as quickly as possible.
Despite the difficulties encountered in the negotiations, due not least to the highly sensitive international context, the work that has resulted in the proposal for a directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste has succeeded in outlining a coherent, harmonised legislative framework to ensure that this kind of waste is managed safely, no matter what applications and consequences nuclear energy may have in the future. I believe this is where the great strength of the proposal in question lies.
Despite the diversity of opinions regarding how the sector should be managed, there is a point of agreement which it is important to stress: fishing is extremely important to the European population's food supply and a source of employment for the majority of the EU's coastal communities, where there are no other jobs.
Despite the economic crisis we are experiencing, it is important to maintain these instruments for aiding developing countries so that they may be able, in the near future, to increase their levels of wealth, with the inherent improvement in the living conditions of the populations in these so-called emerging countries.
Despite the eight International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions, according to the ILO itself, more than 50% of workers do not enjoy social rights, in particular, immigrants, women and children.
Despite the fact that Canada is a developed country, where very few questions could be raised over the level of respect for social rights and the highest environmental standards, the Commission - before Parliament, even - has set out a basis for negotiations with the equivalent Canadian authorities which goes into detail on many issues that need to be modified in order for us to be satisfied.
Despite the fact that Europe is still behind the US and is losing the lead it had over the developing economies, the results of the Seventh Framework Programme demonstrate the added value of this European programme for research and development in Europe.
Despite the fact that Japan suffered one of the biggest ever earthquakes recorded, followed by one of the biggest tsunamis that has ever occurred, even though they were not prepared for them, even though they had not even carried out the improvements suggested, even though nothing had been done to ensure that there would be a supply of power in the event of emergencies, and even though the Japanese made other mistakes right at the start, there were few personal injuries.
Despite the fact that approximately 500 000 hectares of EU forest are lost every year as a result of forest fires and illegal logging, the long-term trend of increasing forest coverage in the EU appears stable.
Despite the fact that the EU has opened up its markets, our companies face huge problems if they want to access public sector markets in third countries. I feel that significant political attention must be given to this issue as a matter of urgency.
Despite the fact that the position of Parliament on the revision of the Euratom Treaty is only of consultative value, MEPs have sent a clear message to the Council: the EU must provide itself with the appropriate means to develop a responsible energy policy that it can hand on to future generations.
Despite the fact that the report contains many good measures, it is unfavourable to agriculture in Europe, because it does not support the idea of full alignment of direct payments, it strengthens discrimination against the new Member States, and it also maintains the absurd situation in which, in the area of agriculture, the wealthy countries are helped more, and the poor ones less.
Despite the fact that there has been a lengthy debate as to whether the EU needs a forestry policy or not, I am very pleased to see that appreciation of the economic, social and environmental functions of forests was a common theme in the stakeholder and Council input and that this concern is again evident today in the report drafted by Kriton Arsenis.
Despite the fact that this activity is viewed in very negative terms in France, it is not entirely illegitimate for interest groups, whether commercial, social, trade unions, etc. to make their points of view and expertise known, especially to the less knowledgeable civil servants and elected representatives.
Despite the fact that work on the simplification of procedures has slowed down during the more than two years spent on this dossier, I would note that Parliament proposed extending the original scope of the regulation, in particular to include provisions concerning the country of origin of textile products, so I am glad that a balanced compromise has been reached. I would point out, however, that my group decided to approve the proposal in its initial version, which provides rapid benefits for business and consumers.
Despite the fact that, as I understand it, it was asked to cease trading by the high court in Catalonia in 2001 and was found to be guilty of misleading practices in the Belgian courts and by the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading, it continues to trade.
Despite the full integration of this new rule, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has been charged with clarifying and consolidating the content of this provision so that it is more readily understandable, particularly in the context of the ordinary legislative procedure.
Despite the improvements in this area, IAs by the European Commission and European Parliament could improve even further.
Despite the logical conclusions that you have outlined today, I am still not clear about the consequences of the forthcoming test.
Despite the many proposals that have been seen through in the last three years - I am thinking of the Late Payments Directive in particular - a lot of progress remains to be achieved to make things easier for small and medium-sized enterprises, not only in respect of the administrative burden they have to deal with, but also the difficulty in accessing funding that they experience.
Despite the obstacles to trade liberalisation that still remain and the Union's reservations regarding current practices in Canada, I hope that the necessary bases can be established for a mutually beneficial trade partnership sooner rather than later. A comprehensive economic and commercial agreement between Canada and the European Union could end up being the most ambitious and wide-ranging that we have yet concluded. I hope that will be the case.
Despite the ongoing fighting and its spread to various parts of Libya, humanitarian organisations are doing a remarkable job in preventing a major humanitarian disaster.
Despite the repeated criticisms they have received in Europe and the US, the reputation of agencies has not really suffered.
Despite the success of this vote, given the cross-border implications for the safety and health of European citizens, I regret the minor role that Parliament has been given in nuclear matters as it has only a consultative role in this matter.
Despite the understandable focus on the problems in the south, we must not forget how important our eastern neighbours are.
Despite these difficulties, I congratulate the Foundation on its intention to improve the performance of Vocational Education and Training (VET) systems in the Foundation partner countries ('Torino Process') while at the same time undertaking a thorough review of its recruitment procedures.
Despite this figure, I believe it essential that the principles of economy, efficiency and effectiveness be applied.
Despite this, I consider the clause to be backward and needlessly submissive to the populist pressure of the French and Italian premiers.
Despite this, I do think it is important for the European Union to seek the application of the International Labour Organisation's rules and agreements in international treaties with third countries, because it seems to me, as we learn more about the labour market and working conditions in Asia, Africa and other corners of the world, that we must strive to ensure that significant improvements are made in the status of workers in these regions and areas too.
Despite this, we found common ground and also achieved some specific objectives, for example, the protection of certain parts from land speculation, greater protection of forests which are prized for their biodiversity, such as the northern Boreal and Mediterranean forests, and a ban on building on land cleared by arson.
Detainees were refused the opportunity to call their witnesses and to meet in proper conditions and on a regular basis with their legal representatives.
Developing the concept of corporate social responsibility is the other interesting aspect of the report because, although it is currently a useful concept, it is still based on voluntary participation and therefore has room for improvement.
Development aid must therefore provide support for state infrastructures and increase the population's access to basic services that are organised at the moment by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and international organisations.
Development assistance implemented by the United Nations must focus especially on achieving the Millennium Development Goals, with particular attention to the Least Developed Countries.
Development cooperation is the only external action policy which defends the most marginalised and vulnerable groups of society.
Developments in the investment climate and the rule of law are essential components in Russia's forward development.
Dialogue between Russia and the EU should be extended to all sectors and we should move towards a strategic partnership for our common future. I consider that we have common interests with Russia, which we should utilise constructively in order to reach specific agreements on trade, on energy, in order to move towards a transparent and reliable energy policy, and on facilitating the movement of people between Russia and the EU, by making it easier to obtain a visa.
Dialogue is difficult, but a desire for peace has been very clearly expressed. I should like the European Parliament to continue to pay close attention to this important development, because the Basque Country is at the very heart of Europe.
Did the Pakistani authorities really not know about this? Last year, the Veneto region was also hit by extremely serious floods, which crippled many local textile companies.
Did you, or do you intend to, engage with Member States and with the Israeli authorities to discuss the development of this initiative and maybe to propose a positive contribution by the European Union that could lead to a more responsible outcome?
Different national requirements for the project partners often make cooperation and the implementation of specific, sustainable projects more difficult.
Digital services and personal data are very important in Europe as well. I am convinced that India can fulfil European conditions concerning personal data, although the EU is amending them at the moment and will probably change them as technology develops.
Digital television and wireless broadband can develop successfully in parallel and we should not forget that broadband Internet access also offers high cultural and social value.
Diplomatic consultations with the World Trade Organisation definitely require time because the concerns of the Union's trade partners must be taken into account.
Direct investment is certainly not the miracle cure claimed during the economic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe, for example.
Directive 1999/62/EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures allows Member States, if they so wish, to also charge road users for some external costs.
Directive 70/157/EEC is one of the separate directives of the EC type-approval system provided for in Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, and lays down technical prescriptions concerning the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles.
Directive 76/432/EEC is one of the separate directives of the EC type-approval system provided for in Council Directive 74/150/EEC, as replaced by Directive 2003/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on type-approval of agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units, and repealing Directive 74/150/EEC, and lays down technical prescriptions concerning braking devices.
Directive 80/720/EEC is one of the separate directives on the EC type-approval system provided for in Directive 74/150/EEC, as replaced by Directive 2003/37/EC and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on type-approval of agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units, and repealing Directive 74/150/EEC, and lays down technical prescriptions concerning the design and construction of agricultural or forestry tractors as regards the operating space, access to the driving position as well as the doors and windows.
Directive 86/415/EEC is one of the separate directives of the EC type-approval system provided for in Council Directive 74/150/EEC, as replaced by Directive 2003/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on type-approval of agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units, and repealing Directive 74/150/EEC, and lays down technical prescriptions concerning the installation, location, operation and identification of controls.
Discussions of tricky subjects like extraction from tar sands and the associated environmental impact, ILO standards, as well as the recognition of technical standards and the traceability of food products, must also continue on equal terms in order to reach a consensus.
Disselkoen has once again paid a large amount of money as bail and is back in the Netherlands, but his case shows that the European Arrest Warrant may lead to degrading situations.
Divergence of contract law at national level leads to additional transaction costs, legal uncertainty for companies and a lack of consumer confidence in the Internal Market.
Divergences in contract law in the Member States create structural problems that discourage businesses and consumers.
Do more in Syria and do not lend your support to half-baked solutions.
Do not forget that if we lose antibiotics as a weapon, we will be back to the time of our great grandmothers when what we currently think of as trivial infectious diseases, such as a small child's ear inflammation, could once again become fatal diseases.
Do not misunderstand: I know that humanitarian aid is apolitical and that humanitarian workers must not be put at risk but, in the primary objective of saving lives, sometimes it is only the military who have the equipment or people to achieve that - delivering aid at speed, putting in place the infrastructure - and that is why, should a UN request arrive, we will be ready to help.
Do not push EU culture; make Italian, German, French, Dutch, British and all the other cultures available for all who want to sample them, and the rest will follow.
Do the state of the public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and Europe's place in the world match the vision of the founding fathers of Europe? Definitely not: they have evolved and changed.
Do we not have any other message to pass on to the emerging democracies on the other side of the Mediterranean?
Do we really think that the fact that this constitution mentions the rights of the unborn child constitutes a risk for modernity? Do we really think that the fact that the Christian roots of a country are mentioned in this constitution constitutes a risk for identity?
Do we want to deliver the final blow to the European textiles sector? That is certainly not what the Lega Nord want, nor do we intend to accept it.
Do we want to have 27 of those in all kinds of countries in Africa, or do we want to have a single EU one? The latter means that more money will have to go to the EU for that EU embassy, but it also means that 27 times less money is spent in the 27 Member States.
Do you feel that the interest rate which you will have to pay under the future programme should be lowered? Would lowering these interest rates help your country?
Do you find it acceptable that the Union has Member States, for instance France, whose constitution does not contain fundamental rights? My country's new constitution not only contains fundamental rights, but it is the first in the European Union to take the European Charter of Fundamental Rights as a standard.
Do you find it acceptable that the Union has Member States, for instance the United Kingdom, that do not have a unified written constitution? My country's new constitution is a democratic, written constitution.
Do you find it compatible with the prohibition of discrimination based on birth that the European Union has Member States, such as Spain, Belgium or Sweden, where citizens are entitled to hold high-ranking state positions, for instance that of the monarch, based on their birth? My country's new constitution does not apply such discrimination.
Do you know how much money the Member States of the European Union made, just from the sale of arms to Libya in 2009? EUR 343 million.
Do you not think that this contradicts all the principles that have been expressed, including by the Treaty itself?
Do you start the negotiations and then hope that in the course of the negotiations, you can resolve the non-tariff barriers that have been in place for many years, or do you rather try to do away with the majority of the non-tariff barriers as a precondition for negotiations on the free trade agreement? I think that, to a certain extent, we need that conditionality, because the real problem with Japan is not so much tariffs.
Do you want to know what honestly annoys me? We hear a lot said about solidarity.
Documents received: see Minutes
Does he believe the very essence of being a country - having a domestic government, an independent economy and national borders - is inherently wrong? Why not have the guts to just scrap Parliament and take over Europe by force? Name calling, scaremongering and creeping bureaucracy is calculated and megalomaniac.
Does the Commission agree that payments should be reviewed if a region has been receiving structural funding for years without this resulting in it meeting the targets set?
Does the Commission apply efficiency and performance criteria to these agencies? If so, may we see the criteria? Secondly, how do the agencies perform against the criteria? Can the Commission show Parliament an analysis of the agencies' performance? Thirdly, given the considerable functional overlap, has the Commission considered merging them? We have heard about synergies; we want to see them.
Does the Commission have a view on what importance should be given to the role of farmers, in terms of carbon sinks, forests and other measures, when fighting one of the biggest challenges our environment faces today?
Does the Commission have any plans to address the tonnes of EU waste already dumped in African countries? Does the Waste Shipment Regulation need to be revised or is it just a matter of enforcement? This is an urgent problem and action needs to be taken now. I await your response.
Does the Commission intend to accept the application of the principle of reciprocity as part of the existing legal protection methods when it comes to resolving trade disputes? Does the Commission think that, in the long run, the implementation of the 'negative list' approach to deregulating services can set a precedent for other, future negotiations too?
Does the Commission think that the proposed cuts in next year's budget will have a negative impact on the amounts allocated to education, training and boosting employment in the EU in general?
Does the European Union - an important interlocutor of the G8 - support this statement? If it does, have you told the Palestinian side, which is planning to take unilateral action during the United Nations General Assembly meeting in September?
Does the same call for responsible behaviour not deserve to be addressed to all the governments in the EU? Are all the political leaders aware of the impact of the statements they have made about Greece over the last 18 months? The time has come for the European Council to put a stop, tomorrow, to the discord among its members.
Does this make us a key international player with influence to match our economic strength? The answer is a resounding 'No'. Europe is still effectively a bit player, at best a Tom Thumb in politics and geostrategy, despite the ever-increasing expectations of European public opinion.
Dolly the sheep was neither the first nor the last cloned animal.
Domestic work is economically and socially important, but it is work that is poorly paid, routine and undervalued by society.
Domestic work should be legally recognised as work, we should give all domestic workers more rights and prevent violations and abuses in order to establish a legal framework for all domestic workers and ensure that their work does not take place outside the regulatory framework.
Domestic workers are currently excluded from the Maternity Leave Directive and from any European legislation guaranteeing the right to maternity protection, and they are not even covered by the Health and Safety Framework Directive.
Domestic workers are often discriminated against and can easily be subjected to unequal, unfair or abusive treatment. I welcome the ILO initiative to adopt a convention supplemented by recommendations on decent work for domestic workers.
Domestic workers' vulnerability means they are often discriminated against and can easily be subjected to unequal, unfair or abusive treatment.
Dossiers that analyse the effectiveness with which EU legislation has been transposed within Member States are of crucial importance. I echo the conclusions of the rapporteur, especially those that concern the importance of SMEs to European economies and the need to facilitate access to finance as well as the need for greater encouragement for SMEs to enhance innovation, thus increasing competitiveness.
Doubts about the consequences of transposing this directive in the individual Member States and the deletion from the text of the amendment approved by our Member in committee induce me to abstain.
Doubts arose over the fairness and professionalism of their evaluations after the transparency of their operating mechanisms was found to be wanting, and it is therefore time we looked for ways to improve the system for the constant assessment and rating of financial products.
Downward pressure is being exerted on prices by the low production costs and low social, environmental and quality standards in third countries, which cannot be compared with the standards in the EU. When new trading relationships are established, it is essential for us to protect European production levels by including safeguard clauses.
Drawing on the lessons to be learnt from the recent crisis, this report is noteworthy for seeking to prioritise the monitoring and coordination of the economic policies adopted in the various Member States, for the sake of a strong, well-balanced economic union.
Drawing up a new MFF as set out in this report will help devise a long-term action plan which will produce definite results and offer the potential to ensure economic growth for the EU.
Driving position and the doors and windows of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors (
Due account should also be taken of the development of new modules and experience acquired in the course of pilot studies.
Due to a gradual liberalisation of special sectors (water, electricity and gas), in order to protect the enterprises that operate in these areas, we need a qualification system for clients, aimed at ensuring that the competing enterprises are selected efficiently. I am in favour of the motion for a resolution, since it is necessary, in a transparent regime, to keep the fragmentation of EU public procurement law in order to achieve the highest possible levels of competitiveness and efficiency, as set out in our targets.
Due to internal shortcomings, we are at risk of losing our credibility as upholders of respect for human rights outside the EU. This is why I urge genuine protection at EU level for the freedom of expression and press pluralism.
Due to the changes that have taken place in the meantime, particularly as a result of the 2005 World Trade Organisation (WTO) Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, the removal of the first proof of origin for products seems to be justified, and I therefore voted for the repeal of this regulation.
Due to the current crisis and the drastic public spending restrictions, Member States are finding it increasingly difficult to record economic growth. I must stress the need for the EU to respond to demographic challenges.
Due to the reasons mentioned, there will be an increase in transportation costs and the price of freight transportation.
During a period of economic decline, investments are needed to preserve jobs and foster development.
During its negotiations with the EU Council of Ministers, Parliament included new provisions in the regulation, such as those requiring the indication of animal-derived materials in textile products and conducting a study to determine whether there is a causal link between allergic reactions and the chemicals used in textile products.
During my time in Parliament, I have campaigned on many occasions for nuclear safety in the EU. Such a risky technology for generating energy with all its hazardous by-products and fatal consequences for both man and nature in the event of nuclear meltdown should not be glossed over under the pretext of climate protection.
During our debates on strengthening and improving management of the Schengen area, we must at the same time consider the European Union's new migration policy, not only in the context of the situation in North Africa, but also with regard to possible events in the countries neighbouring us to the east.
During the Bosnian war, between 1992 and 1996, Sarajevo suffered the longest siege of a capital city in modern warfare history.
During the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe in March 2011, the Ukrainian representatives explained that more time is needed to shake off the Communist past. I think, too, that achieving democracy is not easy, but requires the will to introduce change and take forceful steps.
During the Health Council yesterday, I asked Germany to reinforce surveillance, outbreak controls and measures in order to identify the source of the outbreak and halt the spread of the infection. I also asked that the causes of the contamination should be swiftly dealt with.
During the January debate on the situation in Tunisia and Egypt and the freedom of religious expression, I mentioned the tragic situation of Christians in Arab countries, particularly the Egyptian Coptic Christians, who are being persecuted. I pointed out the radicalisation of Islam, which is directing its aggression against the followers of Christ.
During the current economic and financial crisis where the unemployment rate, especially among young people, has exceeded the 20% mark at EU level and even 30% in some Member States, improving vocational education and training must become a priority for the European Union.
During the debate, it became clear that better and more systematic cooperation between the authorities in the Member States is needed and this will be incorporated into Mrs Reding's communication at the end of the year. I can assure you that we see this issue as being just as urgent as you do. This is why we want to take the next steps as quickly as possible.
During the debate, one of our fellow Members said that letting Romania and Bulgaria join Schengen would be a childish decision. I totally disagree. I believe that when we become adults, we appreciate rational arguments, and if we have been well educated, we recognise when rational arguments are fair.
During the election campaign, my party demanded mandatory registration of lobbyists on a register that is common to all EU institutions.
During the last parliamentary term, the Commission even presented proposals, for example, in respect of the Working Time Directive, which ran completely counter to ILO Convention No 1 on Hours of Work, adopted in 1919, which laid down a working week of 48 hours. I am very glad that Parliament rejected this directive.
During the last year, the Commission discussed and adopted a communication which highlights the options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 20% in line with the conclusions, in other words, a reduction of 30%. It also considers whether this target is technically and economically feasible and whether it will have an impact on costs, although we assume that the costs will be lower than previous estimates indicated.
During the negotiations on the wider 'six pack' a number of suggestions for improving this Council directive were made, many by the European Central Bank and by Members of this House.
During the negotiations with the EU Council of Ministers, the inclusion of new provisions in the regulation was very important, such as those requiring the indication of animal-derived materials in textile products and conducting a study to determine whether there is a causal link between allergic reactions and chemicals or mixtures used in textile products.
During the negotiations, the Council ignored these legitimate concerns, which is extremely regrettable.
During the past five months, and for the remaining time ahead of us, we will fight to express this, and for the Council to determine that as far as the technical standards are concerned, Romania and Bulgaria are ready to join the Schengen area.
During the previous parliamentary term, the Conference of Presidents created a Working Party on Parliamentary Reform, tasked with reviewing the functioning of Parliament and suggesting improvements.
During the previous parliamentary term, the Conference of Presidents set up a Working Party on Parliamentary Reform, tasked with reviewing the functioning of Parliament and recommending possible improvements.
During the recent financial crisis, many financial institutions around the world failed at great cost to the taxpayer. I support the Commission's initiative to take a critical look at the soundness of financial institutions and of the financial system as a whole, and at the regulation and supervision of the system, in order to prevent any repeat of the crisis in the future and to ensure that the financial sector meets the needs of the real economy and displays the greatest possible degree of social responsibility.
During the recent presentations of South Stream investment plans in Brussels, it was apparent that Russia and Gazprom want privileges and a special status.
During the trialogue, the Commission representatives admitted to us themselves that they have not used any theoretical or econometric model as a basis for making sound predictions and recommendations.
During the vote on the parliamentary report on Innovation Union, I was keen to support the amendment rejecting the idea of controlling innovation by channelling towards innovative activities the resources from the structural funds and from certain sections of the common agricultural policy funds.
During the vote on trade relations between the EU and Japan, I decided to vote for the resolution tabled by the political group which I belong to. This resolution highlighted the need to remove the non-tariff barriers which the Japanese market is subject to and to deregulate access to the Japanese public procurement market before signing a free trade agreement with this country.
During their development, in July 2009, guidelines proposed by the Commission on state aid were adopted, establishing that banks needing financial aid to tackle the crisis should also be subjected to stress tests.
During this entire period, the Schengen Evaluation Working Party has carried out systematic inspections and checks, which have now shown that both countries are sufficiently well prepared to apply the provisions of the Schengen acquis satisfactorily.
During this process, I have not disguised my own scepticism regarding the introduction of origin labelling. I am therefore also pleased that we agreed on a text that merely requires the Commission to analyse the need for origin labelling.
During this whole period, environmental factors must be closely monitored while the waste is being stored, also during its transportation and that of the products obtained from recycling spent fuel.
Dying forests throughout Europe represent both an environmental problem, in terms of natural habitats and climate change, and an economic problem.
EU cohesion policy is part of a European framework of solidarity encompassing the 27 Member States and their 271 regions, and aims to end existing economic and social disparity within the EU. The purpose of this report, drafted by Mr Vlasák, is to follow up the previous report, entitled 'The urban dimension of cohesion policy in the new programming period'. The role of cities, where 80% of the European population lives, as sources of wealth creation, and as hubs of social and economic development is indisputable.
EU cultural attachés will simply mean more highly paid non-jobs for favoured EU civil servants paid for by the contributing countries. I have to also say that it is grossly insensitive of the Commission to make this ludicrous and expensive proposal for unnecessary cultural attachés at a time of universal economic hardship.
EU governments will continue to have the option of imposing universal public service obligations on private operators and of subsidising public services as necessary.
EU legislation providing for this already exists for footwear, and it makes sense to provide our consumers with the same level of information when they buy their clothes.
EU statistics show that more than 25% of young Lithuanians are forced to take low paid work and conclude short-term contracts with insufficient social security guarantees.
EU-Mauritania Fisheries Partnership Agreement (motions for resolutions tabled): see Minutes
Each of the agencies - Eurofund, OSHA, the European Training Foundation and Cedefop - has a specific role to play.
Earlier this week I warned colleagues that heading into a direct confrontation between Parliament and the Council on an issue that I did not believe I could explain to any man on the street would not be a responsible position of this Parliament.
Earlier this week, High Representative Catherine Ashton issued a declaration on behalf of the EU reiterating the EU view that an independent process to address these extremely serious allegations should contribute to strengthening the process of reconciliation and ensuring lasting peace and security in Sri Lanka.
Earlier this year I made some enquiries to the European Commission in response to press reports about shipments of toxic waste from Italy to Romania.
Earlier, we discussed Mr Coelho's report and the need to safeguard Schengen as one of the most beautiful achievements of the European Union.
Early childhood care and education are made available in different ways throughout the European Union, with different definitions of 'quality', which depend significantly on the cultural values of each country and region, and on their interpretation of 'childhood'. Early childhood learning is the basis for successful lifelong learning, which is central to achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy. I therefore voted in favour of the report on early childhood learning which sets out common EU objectives in pursuing the aims of the Barcelona European Council: specifically, that, by 2010, the provision of childcare should be ensured for at least 90% of children between three years old and the mandatory school age, and for 33% of children under the age of three.
Early childhood education and care generally receives less attention and investment than the other education levels.
Early childhood education is fundamental. I totally support the aims previously set out to provide childcare services by 2010 to at least 90% of children between three years of age and the mandatory school age and to at least 33% of children under three years of age.
Early childhood is unquestionably of fundamental importance to the physical, mental and social development of children, and we must therefore understand that the return on investment in pre-school education is the guarantee of future growth.
Early in January 2011, the International Trade Committee made a proposal to the Council to ensure that the procedure was speeded up, but received no answer.
Early years education has far-reaching implications on children's future development and their chances of success later on. Investments made during this period reduce the costs incurred later relating to health matters, the crime rate and antisocial behaviour.
Early years learning is a very important issue that has not received the attention it is due from lawmakers.
Eastern Germany requires support.
Economic development, with the resumption of foreign investment and, above all, tourism, is unthinkable without tolerance, order and stability.
Economic governance should be built on stronger national ownership of commonly agreed rules and policies and on a more robust EU national economic policy surveillance framework.
Economic interests must never be given a higher priority than the health of workers and citizens.
Economic literature has been asking for years whether it is necessary to continue using the rate of growth of GDP as an indicator of the progress made by a geographic area over a given period of time. I believe that there is currently no other indicator that is as concise or complete.
Economic, social and territorial cohesion are fundamental principles in determining all EU policies and activities. I share the rapporteur's view that the economic crisis will force us to be more innovative and to seek a bigger impact from the available funding.
Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars of an EU that is conscious not only to promote and develop excellence by encouraging innovation, but also to create convergence and bridge the gaps of and in less developed areas compared with more advanced ones.
Economically, it is farmers who will suffer while this goes on - farmers whose food is perfectly safe.
Economists disagree on many things; however, history has taught us two things: firstly, that you cannot save a bankrupt by giving him expensive loans and, secondly, that extreme austerity can never reduce the deficit of a macro-economy in recession which is unable to depreciate its currency.
Education and training are key factors for greater prosperity and greater social cohesion in Europe.
Education is about our future, it is about having adults who are employable, who are fit, who are healthy, who are not a drain on our social services.
Education is undoubtedly a complex, long-term process, the quality and, in particular, the results of which consequently influence the future careers of young people.
Education, vocational training and also the universal idea of 'lifelong learning' are the building blocks for the future of European integration, which is coming up against ever-new challenges in respect of support for the Europe 2020 strategy.
Effective earmarking of this revenue, which increases accountability and transparency, will not only increase public acceptance but will also ensure the reduction of external costs on road transport.
Effective human resources management appears to be Eurojust's main problem.
Effective multilateralism should be the overriding strategic concern of the Union and, in this context, the EU should take a leading role in international cooperation, support international institutions, facilitate international consensus and advance global action.
Effective spectrum use must be promoted in the EU in order to satisfy the growing need for radio frequencies, and mobile broadband capacity must be increased, ensuring better opportunities for the public and commercial sector.
Efficiency of rural development policies requires close coordination with the implementation of measures under the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development and regional policy instruments alike. A single strategic framework is required for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), the Cohesion Fund, the European Social Fund (ESF), the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) and the European Fisheries Fund (EFF), to ensure a common approach and to increase the synergies between all the financing instruments mentioned.
Efficient use of resources is another aspect also related to the future quality of life in the EU. We are always talking about this, but so far in practice, we have unfortunately taken too little action for our words to be translated into reality.
Efforts must be coordinated to resolve this problem.
Efforts to encourage greater participation by SMEs must also be encouraged at the highest level and we must ensure that bureaucracy is kept to the minimum.
Eighty per cent of the European budget is, indeed, spent in Member States and managed by Member States.
Either these countries will look only to China or to Russia, or they will at least have a chance to look towards Europe. I believe that this is important.
El Khadraoui has done a great job on this report.
Elected representatives enforcing a slashing of living standards for workers should, at the very least, accept that their own privileges undergo the same treatment. I will continue to urge that public representatives be paid an average skilled worker's wage and to advocate the elimination of unnecessary costs, perks, benefits and other privileges.
Elimination of parallel structures, quicker transfer of funds, and harmonisation of FP7 with national priorities can all contribute to making the largest possible number of actors interested in research and innovation activities.
Elsewhere it is dramatic: in the Baltic States, Ireland, Greece and Slovakia, unemployment among young people stands at 30% or above.
Emergency measures therefore need to be adopted that give an immediate and suitable response to the sector's socio-economic needs, such as the creation of a guarantee fund, paid for at Union level, that ensures the stability of fuel prices and the use of all financial possibilities and margins of the EU budget to finance extraordinary support measures for the sector.
Energy accounts for a significant proportion of the fisheries sector's operating costs and the recent fuel price increase has caused the situation of the fisheries sector to deteriorate, with a direct impact on production costs in this sector.
Enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in euro area (
Enhanced cooperation and good-neighbourly relations between the European Union and Russia are of major importance for stability, security and prosperity for Europe and beyond. I hope that today's vote will lead to the adoption of decisive measures towards taking a common path based on transparency and the sharing of common missions to complete for the common good. I am referring to those measures necessary to prevent any breach of safety in Europe, including further cooperation on illegal immigration, improved controls at cross-border checkpoints and more effective exchange of information on terrorism and organised crime.
Enhanced cooperation and good-neighbourly relations between the European Union and Russia are of major importance for the stability, security and prosperity of Europe and beyond.
Enhanced coordination between the transnational dimension and the macro-regional strategies, simplified implementation by adopting a separate regulation. A better use of European groupings for territorial cooperation, which are the only purely Community-wide tool for multilevel governance.
Enhancing strategic autonomy in security affairs entails, for the EU, the capacity to agree upon common political objectives and strategic guidelines, to establish strategic partnerships with relevant international organisations, including NATO, and with other countries, to collect adequate information and generate joint analyses and assessments, to harness and, where necessary, pool financial, civilian and military resources, to plan and run effective crisis management operations across the extended range of the Petersburg-type missions, and to frame and implement a common defence policy, laying the first tangible foundations on which to build common defence.
Enhancing the attractiveness and the environment of these discriminated-against territories is to restore confidence among those living there.
Enhancing transparency entails clearly defining what the authorities' responsibilities are and providing a well-founded and coordinated system for informing the general public in order to gain and maintain their confidence in the management of radioactive waste resulting from the nuclear energy production process and from nuclear medicine.
Enlargement, support for civil rights and the establishment of the rule of law, diplomatic relations with the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the Arab-Palestinian conflict and condemnation of the bloodiest regimes are some of the subjects of the report that I am submitting to your vote.
Enough talking, now let us move on.
Ensure that they are consolidated so that you see it through together, so that you have economies of scale.
Ensuring access to suitable education and appropriate courses is absolutely essential in order to make sure that people finishing school, university or vocational training have no trouble in finding employment in their chosen field.
Ensuring all young children receive equal quality care and education, whatever their age and social condition, is a minimum.
Ensuring that animals are healthy is the best means of avoiding infection and the use of antibiotics.
Ensuring that the skills being learned are in line with the competences - including for citizenship - required for the new goals of sustainable and intelligent growth is essential, as are policies for the transition from education to the workplace and speeding up the recognition of professional qualifications, titles and academic credits.
Ensuring the recovery and future sustainable development of Pakistan is extremely important, not only for its citizens, but also for the security and stability of the region. A stable and prosperous Pakistan that is not subject to extremist or fundamentalist tendencies is obviously in the interests of the European Union.
Ensuring the survival of a doomed energy system will not help fishermen; they, too, will inevitably be doomed as a result of it. Instead, they should be given the opportunity to redeploy their fisheries resources and to refocus their factors of production on energy-saving tools.
Entirely in favour of the implementation of a common European approach for early childhood learning - while respecting the diversity of each Member State's approach - I lend my support to Mrs Honeyball's report, which recommends establishing a European framework for ECEC services, highlighting common values and objectives.
Entrepreneurship is meaningful insofar as it contributes to society as a whole, but if someone engages in pseudo-business in order to lure other, honest traders and companies to a directory purely for the sake of their own enrichment, and in doing so uses subterfuge, this is downright fraud, no matter how much they protest that they are not doing anything illegal.
Entrepreneurship, training, flexibility, smart regulation and access to credit are the key words of the Small Business Act, a framework that defines the EU policy for SMEs through targeted assistance and training activities for young people.
Environmental challenges and the fight against climate change mean that the post-2013 CAP now has a new role to play, for which I believe we need a stronger and more sustainable CAP equipped with a budget that can meet the objectives to be pursued, with particular attention to the development of quality food products and to the needs of small farmers.
Environmental concerns can never be jeopardised, but at the same time, they cannot be detached from economic issues; still less in this time of crisis that we are still experiencing, and which continues to buffet the countries of southern Europe, especially my country, Portugal.
Environmental data currently available at European level should be expanded in the medium term by adding information to facilitate policy assessment.
Environmental economic accounts should contribute to policy evaluation, particularly by making available data concerning the environmental impact of economic activities.
Environmental protection is one of the European Union's priorities.
Equal access to the European Union's waters and resources is one of the basic principles of the common fisheries policy.
Equally important among the corrective measures is the possibility for the Commission to carry out enhanced surveillance missions in the Member State concerned in order to monitor the implementation of the plan.
Equally important is transparency with regard to the financial resources from which a lobbying and consulting company draws its revenue.
Equally, if these companies move outside the EU, they also have concerns about that.
Especially important, as I personally have stated on several occasions, is the proposal to facilitate labour mobility within the framework of the Internal Market.
Especially in these times of scarcity, we cannot afford to have that kind of subsidy.
Essentially, I think that by adopting this measure, Europe has demonstrated that it is further ahead than many Member States, which will clearly have to remedy this situation in short order.
Essentially, this prevents the creation of an internal market in the European Union that is more geared towards and favourable to small business.
Establishing a common strategic framework for the next financial programming period would offer an enhanced approach and leverage the synergies better between the measures implemented in Europe's regions, intended to support EU policy objectives.
Establishing a modernised education system throughout the whole of Europe, placing strong emphasis on substantive research results and, of course, simplifying access to cross-border research programmes in Europe can raise the level of innovation in the EU. However, to ensure that human resources remain here, Europe must focus on the following aspect: making researchers attractive offers, proposals which they cannot refuse.
Euro bank notes and coins are genuinely a pan-European means of payment, as the euro area currently consists of 16 Member States.
Eurofound had a budget increase of 39% and a staff increase of 46%. This is why I am calling urgently on my fellow Members to introduce changes during the next budget debate.
Europe 2020 is the European strategy seeking to respond to the new global challenges for the EU and its various Member States, so it is important to structure the economic and financial conditions which will guide its application in the 2014-2021 period.
Europe and Europeans hold enormous potential; our task is to put in place the appropriate conditions for this potential to be exploited fully.
Europe and its big projects clash with budgetary constraints at national level, meaning that greater involvement of the private sector through project bonds or public/private partnerships is the key to raising competitiveness and growth.
Europe and the UN have a wealth of objectives and interests in common, which, in my view, justifies even closer cooperation and resource synergies. I would therefore like to see Europe accorded a stronger position within the UN, particularly at the annual General Assembly.
Europe cannot remain absent from Camp Ashraf: it is a camp where not only international policy is measured but also human rights protection.
Europe cannot, on the one hand, work with democratic movements in Libya, Syria, Tunisia and Egypt, and refuse to work with a government democratically elected by the Palestinian people.
Europe definitely needs rules and a legal framework for establishing mandatory requirements for ensuring the highest possible level of safety, which both we and Europe's citizens want so much.
Europe has almost 1 000 cities with populations of more than 50 000 and their composition is constantly evolving.
Europe has been struggling for years against an innovation brain drain - creative people who would rather head to the United States because they believe that it is easier there.
Europe has problems with the rising number of emigrants.
Europe includes a number of states that have come from the same mould and this should be taken into consideration when examining relations between the EU and Russia.
Europe is a community of freedom, responsibilities and democratic values.
Europe is definitely more different nowadays to the Europe of 20 years ago.
Europe is in need of well-educated immigrants who reach Europe in compliance with the regulations, and of a common migration policy with adequate resources.
Europe is made up of a rich and diverse mix of educational traditions.
Europe is taking a crucial step with this economic governance package so that our economy can grow soundly.
Europe manages 2.5% or one-fortieth of total budgetary expenditure in Europe.
Europe must be involved here at an earlier stage. I do not believe that we have learnt the right lessons from the crises of the 1990s.
Europe must do the same; it must defend its cultural model and its values on the international stage.
Europe must give itself the means to achieve specific major objectives.
Europe must not hide when it is needed most.
Europe must take innovation policies seriously if we want to find a way out of the crisis and build a better future for our younger generations.
Europe must take on this responsibility by proposing a concerted strategy in the areas of training and employment. I welcome the ambition of this report, which sets at 2% of GDP the investment in higher education.
Europe must welcome the latter if she wants to be true to herself.
Europe needs a robust agricultural policy consisting of transparent rules and efficient and rapid prevention tools, so that it can reduce administrative costs, manage risks and adopt effective crisis-prevention policies. 'Innovation' and a 'well-organised infrastructure network' are the basic criteria necessary to make agribusinesses competitive, competent and well prepared, and to ensure that rural areas too have access to culture and training.
Europe needs a sustainable and competitive economic model that responds to the major social challenges of today, and that ensures more and better jobs.
Europe needs an ever-growing number of its school pupils and students to come into contact with a new social, educational and cultural model. I believe that the mobility programmes aimed at young people will successfully bring about a real change in the attitude of Europe's young people and create a shared vision for them about what Europe stands for, in areas from education, science and research to culture and our common values.
Europe needs the greatest broadband capacity and the fastest speeds to keep up with rising economic powers, like China and India, in the modern economy.
Europe shall not be among the losers.
Europe should also increase its commitment to protect the Christian minorities in the north of the country, who are increasingly the targets of persecution and discrimination.
Europe still has too few programmes to restructure the transport sector for more ecological solutions with a low environmental impact, and there is also a dearth of resources to improve its efficiency and environmental performance.
Europe therefore needs to send out a strong, effective signal to guarantee less red tape, lower costs, greater transparency and shorter delays in payments, and to ensure the stability that small and medium-sized enterprises demand and need so much.
Europe wants to do organised crime an enormous favour.
Europe would fail and people's trust in the capacity of Europe to address their real problems would suffer a huge blow.
Europe's cities are its centres of economic activity, innovation and employment, but they face a number of challenges.
Europe's cities are its centres of economic activity, innovation and employment, but they must face up to a number of challenges. I agree with the rapporteur in that cohesion policy, including the European Agenda, should pursue the objective of overcoming territorial disparities by investing in smart urban development with the aim of raising cities' infrastructure and services to a higher qualitative level.
Europe's cultural industries contribute to European entrepreneurship, innovation and business, and the EU's diverse cultural landscape makes it the most attractive tourist destination in the world.
Europe's cultural practitioners, technical innovators and, above all, Europe's citizens deserve a well-functioning internal market, where creative content can flow freely and generously across our borders and where cultural practitioners are secure in the knowledge that they will receive remuneration for their work.
Europe's current market share of 25% is below expectations. EGNOS is GPS-compatible but will offer more possibilities when Galileo becomes operational in 2013. EGNOS is ten times more accurate than GPS at present.
Europe's current market share of 25% is below expectations. EGNOS will offer more possibilities (EGNOS is ten times more accurate than GPS) when Galileo becomes operational in 2013.
Europe's experience tells us that true democracy is the necessary foundation of tolerance, of peace and of prosperity.
Europe's hardworking citizens are being required to pay more and more.
Europe's large wooded areas create considerable business and employment within the EU. Taking this into account, and not forgetting the importance of these green spaces for the environment, I consider it essential that measures be taken to combat the negative effects of climate change recorded at global level in recent years.
Europe's rapidly ageing society requires innovative solutions in diverse areas which will make it possible for it to function efficiently in spite of the reduced workforce.
Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises lead the way in translating social standards into reality. I take the view that it is vital to have a clear and unambiguous definition of corporate social responsibility that will do away with the current assortment of interpretations, while also establishing ways to check that these responsibilities are met.
Europe, and Member States in particular, are facing the major challenge of improving, during this decade, vocational education and training, for example, and making it more attractive and improving its quality.
Europe, too, recognises the need to pursue projects aiming at economic and industrial growth, by focusing resources and investment on innovative policies, without abandoning the path it has followed in recent decades of playing a leading and guiding role in economic and social development.
European Investment Bank, European Commission, we are actually asking for an investigation into the activities of the European Investment Bank towards the end of September this year so that we can start the next discharge procedure with proper documentation.
European Union aid to South Sudan should be commensurate with what the new state can effectively absorb.
European Union measures are essential, in order to put an end to this situation and provide EU citizens with effective recourse should they have a claim against another citizen or company; measures that simplify and accelerate this payment process.
European agriculture faces at least three major challenges; namely, ensuring the feeding of the population, sustaining the environment and producing energy.
European and Canadian companies will be able to save millions of euro a year thanks to shorter and simpler, hence less costly, product-approval procedures and mutual acceptance of certification findings.
European citizens and taxpayers are rightly paying ever closer attention to the proper spending of EU funds. I therefore welcome the opportunity to present the views of the Council and the Hungarian Presidency during this debate.
European citizens expect and deserve the best possible safety for their nuclear power plants.
European citizens would not understand if the bulk of assistance were to go to large agricultural operators: small farmers too must be able to make a living from what they produce, work in decent conditions and be paid fairly.
European cohesion policy continues to play an important role in reducing significant social and economic disparities among the Member States.
European cohesion policy is and will remain a cornerstone of the EU's tangible action in its regions, as well as the main source of investment in the real economy, capable of helping Europe and its regions to recover from the crisis and become competitive again.
European companies have had improved access to telecommunications, car manufacturing, retail and the insurance sector in Japan, and that has not damaged the Japanese economy but has, in fact, encouraged innovation and development in Japan.
European consumers have the right to know what they are buying.
European contract law stipulates and regulates Internal Market transactions, and aims to resolve problems relating to the Single Market which have arisen for various reasons, including even differences in contract law legislation.
European cooperation to draft a single policy is needed in this sector.
European culture is, as is well known, indebted to many cultures in various parts of the world, like the people subjected to European colonialism, for example.
European environmental economic accounts (debate) 
European fishermen in particular are suffering as a result of this price rise because they cannot simply compensate for the additional costs by increasing their catch or by charging better prices.
European fishers, and especially those who live in the Member States facing the greatest financial difficulties, like Portugal, are in a difficult economic situation which has been exacerbated by the rise in fuel prices.
European forests are major contributors to climate change mitigation and the adaptation of European societies through the continuation of their economic, social and environmental functions.
European funds for promotion are available to operators to promote quality products, with more than EUR 19 million being allocated to fifteen promotion programmes between 2006 and 2010.
European industry has shown that we can count on its commitment to searching for innovative solutions which will help in the fight against climate change.
European innovation policy must be focused mainly on devising and specifically meeting objectives relating to the major challenges which the European Union is facing. I think that a reassessment is needed of the complexity of the tasks and responsibilities which local and regional government authorities have.
European integration has a positive and stimulating influence on the economy.
European interests are served when cultural aspects are strategically devised through cooperation and partnership, both through cultural programmes and when cultural aspects form an integral part of economic, foreign and security and development policies.
European interests are served when cultural aspects are strategically devised through cooperation and partnership, both through cultural programmes, and when cultural aspects are an integral part of economic, foreign and security and development policies.
European interests are served when cultural aspects are strategically devised through cooperation and partnership: both through cultural programmes and when cultural aspects are an integral part of economic, foreign and security and development policies.
European legislation allows for cross-border claims, as well as the mutual recognition of the decisions of national courts, but the current procedure for cross-border debt recovery is arduous and prohibitively expensive.
European legislation must therefore respect Member State sovereignty when looking for a common European interest in the use of these frequencies.
European manufacturers are at a marked disadvantage in the textile industry, because the dumping of cheap and poor quality products from the Far East makes it impossible for European manufacturers to make progress.
European patents currently cost 15 times more than US patents, hence the reason why we must develop the European patent more quickly and reduce its cost.
European regulation of the issue which you are rightly complaining about on the basis of practical experience was not wanted at the time.
European satellite navigation systems have been causing delays and additional costs, which should lead those responsible to give thought to the patterns currently being followed for their implementation.
European solidarity includes the need to finance the 2020 strategy, not least its social objectives, which include combating poverty.
European strategy for sustainable and inclusive growth remains high on the Union's list of concerns, and cannot fail to be present in the preparation for the 2012 EU budget.
European trade policy measures in the textiles sector can be managed without imposing the excessive burden of presenting proof of origin for all imports.
European universities will become more competitive when they pay even greater attention to the needs of the market, the economy, and when they also manage to find additional sources of funding.
European urban diversity must be supported primarily by a flexible mechanism for implementing cohesion policy and by coordinating and adapting urban development projects according to the development needs and strategic guidelines of each city individually.
European vessels entitled to fish in Seychelles' waters will take on board observers appointed by the Seychelles authorities, and during a trip each tuna seiner will take on board at least two Seychelles seamen, in agreement with the shipowner, from the names on a list submitted by the competent authority of Seychelles.
Europol points out that the full admission of Bulgaria and Romania into the Schengen cooperation will give criminal groups from the Balkans and the former Soviet Union easier access to the EU. Until these problems are resolved, full admission of Bulgaria and Romania to Schengen will bolster cross-border corruption and crime whilst, at the same time, giving certain forces the opportunity they were waiting for to demand increased monitoring and undermining of the rule of law.
Eurovignette III will allow Member States - if they so wish - to charge road users for external costs (air, noise, pollution), so that finally, the 'polluter pays' principle is introduced in road transport.
Eurozone leaders tell us that there is no Greek debt restructuring, but since when is a delay of a repayment date not a restructuring?
Evaluation is nothing if the results are not presented, discussed, questioned, and indeed either accepted or sometimes rejected, by the very stakeholders that it aims to serve, and, of course, Parliament plays a vital role in this process, not only bringing to bear a broad cross-section of experience from political and public life but, just as importantly, from the many fields of deep knowledge held by Members.
Evaluation of the implementation of the cohesion policy programmes co-financed by the structural funds in the period 2007-2013 should reflect the impact of projects selected within the cohesion policy framework on the recovery of the European economy, particularly in terms of creating new jobs, reducing socio-economic disparities, enhancing social inclusion and improving human capital.
Evaluations have concluded that most stocks in Mauritania are either fully exploited or over-exploited and, therefore, the Commission must discuss with Mauritania the development of long-term fisheries management plans that would include all fishery allocations by the Mauritanian authorities, to both their national fleets and third-country fleets, in order to ensure the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources.
Even Lady Ashton's and Commissioner Füle's review of the European Neighbourhood Policy is delayed for the third time - and delayed in her office.
Even accepting the rationality of internalising external costs as a valid starting point, it is ultimately untenable to penalise heavy goods vehicles only and not ordinary cars with the aim of mitigating traffic congestion, just as the old 'polluter pays' principle is applied in a clearly discriminatory way.
Even at the main hearing, the court does not consider the evidence but only 10 so-called legal bars to surrender.
Even better, they propose that the sums thus obtained by the EU should be allocated to the EU-IMF stability fund, the effects of which are currently being suffered by the Greek, Irish and Portuguese people.
Even if Pakistan was aware of the whereabouts of the al-Qaeda leader, who was the subject of an international arrest warrant, and therefore would have been called on to extradite him, it does not change the fact that the targeted killing was a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty.
Even if all nuclear reactors were shut down tomorrow, there would still be a legacy of waste from half a century of nuclear generation and from a variety of other activities.
Even if it did happen, it would necessarily be at the cost of governments' decision-making freedom and of what national politicians regard as priorities. I voted against the report.
Even if not all of the individual interests could be taken into account in a compromise, the report was adopted with a large majority in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.
Even if the Council were to come on board, a whole host of loopholes would still exist.
Even if the European Union adopts the tightest possible limits on greenhouse gas emissions, the outcome will be the same if China, India and other developing countries do not also adopt such limits at the same time.
Even if the de minimis threshold was increased, many Member States would not have the money to actually exploit this new opportunity to spend taxpayers' money.
Even if the real responsibilities of EU policy - and we are talking about the irrational criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact, of the policy of the strong euro, and of the ECB guidelines and statutes, which do not respect the particularities of the weaker economies - in relation to the current situation are covered up, nothing justifies applying a package to Portugal that punishes the Portuguese people in return for a loan which needs to be paid back at interest rates higher than those normally charged by the ECB.
Even if the so-called country of origin is specified, other parts of the production process can take place elsewhere.
Even in a high-tech country like Japan, the promised safety levels could not be even remotely achieved.
Even in the past, then, there were signs, but now all European citizens could end up paying the consequences.
Even more importantly, it is also crucial in order to create a momentum for higher productivity, cohesion, competitiveness, and access to one single market for the European industry as a whole.
Even now, the majority of Indian foreign investment is situated in the European Union and the Tata Group alone is a leading employer in the industrial sector in Great Britain.
Even people accused of behaviour that is not an offence in the extraditing country can be surrendered under the European Arrest Warrant if the offence is one for which there is no requirement for dual criminality.
Even since the fall of the Iron Curtain over 20 years ago, its behaviour towards some countries, particularly neighbours such as Georgia, certainly cannot be admired.
Even so, I - and they also - would be prepared to make the sacrifice if the problems were to be resolved, important problems like congestion.
Even so, I should like to draw your attention to the following, Mr Caspary: what will benefit our industry the most? A path towards zero in the very long term, or a rather drastic reduction in the first few years? I believe that we actually need to strike a balance between the two and then see where it takes us. Nevertheless, I should like to draw your attention to the two objectives: to reach zero in, say, 20 years, and to obtain a very moderate reduction in the meantime.
Even so, it is essential to continue making progress with it.
Even some of the payments that appear to be correct are actually supporting grotesque projects.
Even the Spanish Members must understand that.
Even the approach by the EU is novel in this regard as this is the first time the Parliament is co-deciding with the Council on macroeconomic developments and the Council needs the Parliament's agreement in order to reach a final consensus.
Even those young Lithuanians who manage to find work are often forced to accept unfavourable employment contracts.
Even though Directive 2006/114/EC is in place, not enough is being done by the Commission or the Member States to aid businesses affected by the fraud schemes or to eliminate the fraud schemes entirely. I support the resolution of Parliament, which draws attention to this issue, and again ask the Commission to take prompt measures to eliminate this misleading and destructive practice.
Even though I do not think the European Commission should have more powers than it had previously, I agree that the European currency union must establish a more precise mutual control mechanism for budgetary policy.
Even though all of the requirements for an inclusive, sustainable and competitive Europe are included, there is nevertheless no way in the world that we could finance everything all at once from the EU budget. I want a realistic and implementable negotiating strategy and this has not been achieved, as no clear priorities have been set in this report. I therefore abstained in the final vote.
Even though forestry policy is primarily a matter for the Member States, it is nevertheless up to the EU to coordinate and complement the Member States' initiatives and forest programmes, giving them added value, and defining a common EU strategy and action plan.
Even though only 7% of the population of the EU lives in cities with over 5 million inhabitants, compared with 25% in the United States of America, in numerous urban areas, including in Greece, the population is increasing.
Even though the European Parliament's report on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe contains many ideas that should be supported, I did not support it because I believe that it damages the European Union's image in the eyes of its residents.
Even though the directive covers business-to-business misleading advertising, its wider scope is to protect consumers' interests, to safeguard smooth functioning of the Single Market and to significantly improve citizens' lives. I have seen some improvement, but I still believe that much has to be done in order to stop unfair misleading practices.
Even though the text could be improved further and there is an important point that remains, in my view, unresolved, namely the definition of radioactive waste, I believe that we should continue to forge ahead in this area and that it is pointless to deny the need to treat waste. I also voted in favour because the possibility of exporting to third countries was rejected.
Even though there might not be full agreement on every detail, it is important to note that there exists a core common understanding on the big ticketed items, notably, the need for a comprehensive strategy to boost research and innovation in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, the need to make the programme more accessible to the wide range of possible contributors throughout Europe, and the need to further simplify procedures to allow all participants to focus on creativity rather than bureaucracy.
Even though this pathogen should not primarily be treated with antibiotics, we have the problem that it is resistant to many common antibiotics.
Even though this report has become weaker in many respects during the proceedings, and that Parliament has had to give in on several provisions, this is still a big step forward, and I feel that I must give it my full support.
Even though we have the 2006 directive, it is plain that it is not working as well as it should.
Even when the courts have delivered a judgment, in practice it is often difficult for creditors to recover debts if no information is available on the whereabouts of the debtor and his assets.
Even without this escalation of the conflict, in South Sudan, over 40% of the population are already dependent on food aid.
Ever since four MEPs were accused of having accepted money from 'bogus' lobbyists in return for tabling amendments, the institution has been seeking to clarify and reform the rules governing the activity of lobbyists in Parliament. A kind of permanent suspicion has long surrounded MEPs' relationships with interest representatives, hence the creation of a first register of lobbyists in 1996.
Ever since the 1990s, the European Union has seen an exponential increase in cultural and creative industries (CCIs), in terms of the number of jobs they have created and their contribution to gross domestic product.
Ever since the economic and financial crisis began, there has been talk of nothing but credit rating agencies (CRAs). However, what are our thoughts on their now key role? The European Parliament has addressed this issue.
Every Member State has to take responsibility for the ownership of our Union and start acting for the common good of Europe.
Every child - migrant or not - must have mastered the national language by the time they enter school to a degree that enables them to follow the teaching taking place there.
Every country aiming to join the Schengen area must meet, without exception, all of the conditions of the Schengen acquis concerning data protection, the Schengen Information System, borders in the air, on land and at sea, police cooperation and visas.
Every country should have the right to focus on the concerns of its citizens, including food security, the environment, reservations about genetic modification and the needs of rural areas, in order to support sustainable agriculture in Europe.
Every employee must be given one rest day per week, but this does not have to be in the same week.
Every link in the European innovation chain must be strengthened and innovation policy must be focused towards challenges.
Every rule of procedure of the European Parliament should seek three objectives: make the provision more readily understandable and therefore easier to use; lay down new conditions governing the application of the procedure; determine the scope of the procedure. I absolutely agree with the rapporteur.
Every single time, I have heard the EPP say that this should not be party politics and that we should not single out Member States.
Every time I have predicted that a country would need a bail-out, you have come back and said, oh no, they don't, everything is fine.
Every year since 2007, the EU has spent over EUR 6 billion funding research and development on the continent.
Every year, the European Parliament adopts a report on the European agencies to accompany the debates on budgetary discharge.
Everybody could live a richer life, allowing mutual respect for one another to manifest itself.
Everybody in this House knows that detention conditions have a direct impact on the smooth functioning of the mutual recognition of judicial decisions and are the basis for cooperation between judges in the EU. But the system is impeded if judges refuse - sometimes rightly so - to extradite accused persons because the detention conditions in the requesting country are substandard.
Everyone can now see that a default in Greece is coming, except the euro zone finance ministers who, 13 months after uselessly committing EUR 110 billion, now seem set to commit a further sum almost as large.
Everyone here must surely be aware that each political change of direction results in new laws and directives, which in turn demand investment by farms without at the same time increasing their incomes.
Everyone is aware that trade is a driver of economic development and these trade measures will revitalise the economies of the Western Balkans.
Everyone is free to react and criticise the content, because everything works out through debates and interchanges of opinions in the European Union, and it is true that many Member States have criticised the content already.
Everyone seems to agree on this point.
Everyone thought that the current institutional framework - a centralised monetary policy, a Stability and Growth Pact, and the coordination of the other economic policies - would enable the differences between Member States to be overcome, or at least reduced.
Everything needs to be on the table, from different timetables and decommissioning scenarios to qualified moratoriums - without false time pressures, polemics or ideologies.
Everything points to the fact that nuclear energy will become a significant source of energy in the near future, and therefore it is absolutely crucial to ensure that the highest feasible level of safety is achieved in the energy sector.
Evidence of this is provided by the significant cocaine seizures in Croatia, which are mostly connected with sea transport.
Evidence of this is, on the one hand, the lacklustre action deriving from its external policy and, on the other, the obstinacy of certain countries that are nostalgic for a colonial period that can no longer return and insist on believing that they protect their interests better by doing things alone and not delegating anything to European authority.
Evidently, therefore, the rules of procedure concerning parliamentary immunity and privilege cannot apply, and so waiving her immunity complies with the rules governing this House's institutional and legal affairs.
Examples such as the Copenhagen climate change summit, the United Nations General Assembly resolution on enhancement of participation rights - congratulations to Baroness Ashton - or EU participation in the International Monetary Fund show the necessity not only of addressing these issues, but also of finding a common strategy.
Exasperation over the way that some MEPs from countries which themselves have problems with illegal immigration and corruption are looking at Romania and Bulgaria today.
Exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the EU's Stabilisation and Association process (
Excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco (
Existing programmes, such as the European Neighbourhood Policy and the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, have cultural components which need to be coordinated and strategically deployed.
Expedient control of the EU border with Andorra, a principality in between two large EU countries, France and Spain, will ensure a more profitable and amiable relationship in the future. I voted for this protocol because it will encourage greater information exchanges with Andorra on security-related risk management and controls, as well as the standardisation of EU customs security measures, and will encourage the safe movement of goods between Andorra and other EU countries.
Experience from the implementation of cohesion policy programmes now clearly illustrates that the successful outcome of most regional development actions basically depends on the implementation of complementary initiatives.
Experience gained during the first decade of functioning of the economic and monetary union shows a clear need for an improved economic governance framework.
Experience proves the good cost-effective relationship and the crucial role played by port state measures, in conjunction with other instruments, in the fight against IUU fishing.
Experience shows that in many cases, project ideas emerge on the basis of available funding, instead of being based on real needs and on strategic priorities.
Explaining to Dutch taxpayers that their contributions to the European Union are being increased is not the same as explaining to Bulgarian or Polish farmers that the subsidy they are receiving is three times less and that they are obliged to compete in the same competitive market.
Exploiting the issue of counterfeiting purely for protectionist purposes is about as low as it gets.
Extending compulsory labelling should not impose a disproportionate burden on enterprises without bringing real added-value for consumers, who may even be confused by an excess of information on the label of textile products. I believe that it would be useful for the Commission to submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council regarding possible new labelling requirements to be introduced at Union level.
Extending the coverage of EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) should be a priority.
External dimension of social policy, promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility (
FP7 is a chance for the EU to make its research policy match its economic and social ambitions, in particular, by consolidating the European Research Area (ERA). Allocated a budget of around EUR 54 billion for the period 2007-2013, FP7 has, over the years, become one of the largest research support programmes in the world and represents the primary tool of EU research policy.
Faced as we are with well over 400 petitions, as stated in a paragraph of the resolution, we find ourselves discussing this issue again in this Chamber.
Faced with a situation like this, therefore, it is only natural that we have to say, regarding the history of the eight months of difficult negotiations - in which we have taken part and offered the most constructive proposals - on this regulation, that the only position we will now be able to take is, unfortunately, in support of the amendment that, ultimately, envisages the end of this proposal for a regulation as we know it. We have to do so now, not because of a lack of solidarity with Pakistan, but because we believe humanitarian aid should be given in the proper place and in the proper way.
Faced with the challenges that are an ageing population and the globalisation of our economy, we need to encourage the development of lifelong training programmes, particularly through the exchange of good practices between Member States, and improve young Europeans' early training by encouraging partnerships between universities, research centres and companies.
Faced with the challenges that we need to take up in order for our economy to pick up, I am delighted at the appointment of someone who has managed to create a consensus and who has proven capable of paving the way for a stable, strong and competitive monetary union.
Faced with the threat of the Commission imposing annual fines on Member States challenging its authority, the majority can find nothing better to do than propose extending these.
Faced with these many crises and threats, we cannot just hand over the keys to our US friends and allies or to NATO.
Faced with these requirements, it is our duty as politicians to put in place strategies that ensure the following: • Learning centred on a specific outcome; • Teaching entrepreneurship; • Providing bridges for unqualified people who wish to find a job, in particular, through tailored education; • Simplifying the procedures for recognising foreign qualifications in order to encourage workers to be mobile; • Establishing a European framework that offers quality work placements throughout the EU; • Lifelong learning so as to enable workers to adapt to market conditions and company needs. • Promoting creativity as well as information and communication technologies. • Supporting female employment by helping to reconcile work and family life.
Faced with this inevitable catastrophe, the 2020 strategy had to aim at increasing the attractiveness of vocational education and training.
Faced with this situation, it is essential that we consider new solutions.
Facts about this matter are not communicated well or in the right way.
Failure to comply with basic international social standards constitutes a form of social and environmental dumping detrimental to European enterprises and workers. I agree that it is necessary to enhance the role of the relevant international institutions such as the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the United Nations, and to seek their cooperation in the development, implementation and promotion of basic international social standards.
Failure to declare domestic care or cleaning services deprives these workers of the chance of a decent living and, especially, a decent pension.
Far from encouraging 'corporate social responsibility', which is, in practice, non-existent, these agreements only protect the profits of large companies and financial institutions, and do not give the proper attention to labour rights, to the importance of collective bargaining and workers' freedom of association, to the effective elimination of discrimination in respect of employment, to the elimination of forced labour, to insecure and poorly paid work, or to child labour.
Far too little was done during the process of rescuing the banks to respond to this predictable development.
Farmers from the 12 new Member States have now reached the end of a difficult 10-year period, which they agreed to on the understanding that it was a transitional period which would not be extended.
Fearing the danger from radiation, we stayed at home as much as possible for weeks on end, only venturing outside when absolutely necessary.
Fellow Members, Bulgaria and Romania have completed their job and they are building on these security systems in cooperation with their Schengen partners.
Fellow Members, I call on you to support Mr Coelho's report, which will allow us to give the Council a clear, strong political signal that Bulgaria's and Romania's rightful place is in the Schengen area this very year, in order to make external borders more secure and give our citizens greater peace of mind.
Fellow Members, SMEs are key to boosting economic competitiveness.
Fellow Members, the question of what is included in the constitution of a country and what is dealt with at a different legislative level by a certain Member State is something that is quite clearly a matter of national sovereignty.
Fifth, we will encourage Russia to deepen cooperation in our common neighbourhood and continue the dialogue on other topical international issues like the Middle East, for example, or North Africa.
Fifthly, on European citizenship: how often do we invoke the value of European citizenship during our speeches? Since their accession to the EU, in 2007, both Bulgaria and Romania have had a legitimate expectation that their citizens would become fully fledged EU citizens and that they would be able to enjoy the same rights as other EU citizens, including freedom of movement within the Schengen area.
Fifthly, the importance of an efficient inventory of spectrum use, which is an essential part of building an effective and forward-looking policy programme.
Finally it is also aimed at incorporating within international negotiations the rights of workers, which the International Labour Organisation is tasked with defending, as well as promoting a global economic governance that takes these parameters into account.
Finally, Commissioner, I would like to say to you that what we hope for now is consistency, so that reactors that do not pass the tests and that cannot remedy their deficiencies are closed, and transparency, so that all citizens have complete information about the test procedure and results.
Finally, Europe has to be a leader as regards both regulations and the construction of storage facilities.
Finally, I agree with Mr Schlyter on the importance of a fixed date to mark the end of the transitional period so as to safeguard the European economy's competitiveness and to provide investors with a clear picture of current and future regulatory standards.
Finally, I agree with the rapporteur's conclusions and commend the Committee of the Regions on including the follow-up given to Parliament's previous discharge decisions.
Finally, I also think that an impact study needs to be carried out, which will examine the effects of any agreement, particularly in the area of vulnerable European industries, such as the car industry, electronics and aeronautics.
Finally, I also voted for - again thinking of Portuguese textiles - the introduction of a safeguard clause, which provides for the re-establishment of common customs tariff duties on a given product at any time if it is being imported from Pakistan under conditions that cause, or threaten to cause serious problems for an EU producer of similar or directly competing products.
Finally, I am also very sensitive to the financial impact that this crisis is having on farmers, particularly vegetable producers.
Finally, I am from Alsace and therefore know the extent to which the Fessenheim nuclear power plant concerns our German and Swiss neighbours.
Finally, I am pleased that the amendments submitted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament concerning respect, in the context of public contracts, for the labour, social and environmental standards in force in the Member States, have largely been adopted.
Finally, I am proud, in the context of these explanations of vote, to say that I, all fellow Members and political groups voted unanimously, because on such a subject we obviously needed consensus and not controversy.
Finally, I am very happy to see Parliament's enthusiasm - and, in particular, that of my good friend Doris Pack - for the European capitals of culture and Sarajevo's interest in holding the title.
Finally, I believe that the labelling requirement for non-textile parts of animal origin is a sign of real progress as it is consumers who do not want the textile products they buy to contain such materials. I think that, as a whole, this regulation will help deepen the single market for textiles, a move which I fully endorse.
Finally, I believe that we need to ensure that this aid is more effective.
Finally, I condemn the lack of respect for the fundamental rights of freedom of assembly and of expression shown by the Belarusian authorities and call for the immediate and unconditional release of the remaining protestors still in custody and for all charges against them to be dropped.
Finally, I congratulate Commissioner Oettinger for finding a consensus on the criteria and the practical details of implementing the stress tests for nuclear installations, which will enable us to ensure the highest safety levels in the world.
Finally, I fully agree with Parliament's suggestion to the Commission to make the necessary adjustments to the European Social Fund, Erasmus and the Lifelong Learning Programme in order to ensure that funding can be allocated to specific education and training projects, and to projects to tackle youth unemployment and gender discrimination, with more women being encouraged to take part in those projects.
Finally, I fully agree with the idea that it is necessary to set out an action plan for the EU's outermost regions, and multisectoral principles should be established which support their harmonious development and help to reduce the territorial disparities with other European regions.
Finally, I have to point out, as a number of colleagues before me have done, just how absurd it is that the European Parliament is merely consulted and has no real say on this directive, upon which the safety of so many future generations depends.
Finally, I hope that both Eurostat and the Eurobarometer will play a major role in this innovative process.
Finally, I hope the EU recognises the importance of sport, both economically and socially, and will provide funds to boost sport at all levels, particularly as, since the Lisbon Treaty, the EU now has competence in the field of sport for the first time.
Finally, I share the many reservations that have been voiced regarding the agencies, although my reservations only relate to a small number of them.
Finally, I should like to ask if the said concessions will benefit the flood-stricken inhabitants of Pakistan. I doubt it. In order to moderate the virtuous intentions here, my counter-proposal is that concessions should be made on other industrial products.
Finally, I should like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Haglund, on his excellent work and dedication.
Finally, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work he has done in drawing up this report, despite the obstacles the Council placed in the way of accessing certain documentation considered essential to achieving this.
Finally, I should like to emphasise that the adoption of this report comes at an ideal time, for it has enriched the debate on the future of cohesion policy (2014-2020). Indeed, the European Commission will shortly publish its proposals with a view to updating and therefore improving this policy.
Finally, I should like to mention the need to recognise vocational qualifications, thereby facilitating the increased mobility of professionals and students.
Finally, I should like to point out that creating this new category will not involve any additional expenditure, thanks to the savings expected by several regions no longer being under Objective 1. It is also out of the question to reduce the aid for those regions eligible for Objectives 1, 2 and 3.
Finally, I should like to say that the Union must demonstrate flexibility towards the Indian request for protection for non-agricultural Indian geographical indications so that India, in turn, will grant protection for European geographical indications.
Finally, I should like to thank my colleague, Mrs Ford, for all her efforts and commitment towards concluding this report.
Finally, I think the central role of the urban issue in cohesion policy is decisive.
Finally, I too wish to thank both Mr Šefčovič, who has made a huge contribution to the implementation of this agreement, and the representative of the Hungarian Government, for, among other things, the assurance given about the Council joining the agreement in short order, which without doubt has its own uncertainties seeing as the Council certainly represents the second chamber in this case.
Finally, I voted for the amendment on milk, as I do not agree with the European Commission's call for the milk quotas system to be abolished, which will only exacerbate the already precarious position of national producers.
Finally, I want to encourage Parliament to continue to support us with its expert contributions and to make the appropriate demands on us. We believe that the European Union remains on the right track and we want to ensure by means of controls and transparency that we achieve the target of 20% and that nothing goes wrong in Europe.
Finally, I want to support the author of the resolution, Ms Berès, when she says that the European Union should lead the way on improving conditions for domestic workers.
Finally, I want you, Lady Ashton, also to raise the issue about a more serious implementation of the readmission commitments of safe countries with which we, the European Union, have concluded such agreements.
Finally, I welcome the guidelines for the next framework programme. I would particularly stress the recommendation to substantially increase the budget for science and innovation in the EU's next financial framework.
Finally, I would also like to congratulate the Member States on their efforts in putting together the first national strategy report, actively contributing to greater transparency, flexibility, effectiveness and accountability for cohesion policy funds.
Finally, I would also support the proposal to create better links between universities and businesses so that we can take advantage of all the research and development undertaken.
Finally, I would just like to say that we need to follow up on the measures to give small and medium-sized businesses access to China and other markets in Asia.
Finally, I would like to add that we would be very open to finding a swift solution in the second reading - and we would be very grateful if this were possible - in other words, we would suggest that, rather than following the normal procedure of the second reading, we should try to find a so-called early second-reading agreement.
Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on a successful and comprehensive report, and to thank her for her excellent cooperation.
Finally, I would like to highlight the vote on cohesion policy, where a safeguard clause was successfully added in the event that intermediate categories are introduced in order to avoid resources being withdrawn from the regions eligible for funding under the convergence, competitiveness and cooperation objective.
Finally, I would like to mention EU-NATO relations. I welcome the fact that you maintain permanent contacts with the Secretary-General of NATO and the Secretary of State of the United States.
Finally, I would like to mention that we need to reduce our enterprises' administrative burden, in connection with reporting, for example.
Finally, I would like to mention the Canadian state trading companies in the agricultural sector which, as we all know, have broad competences and can act as monopolies.
Finally, I would like to note how very important it is for the Commission's proposal to incorporate and rely even more fully on the strategy document 'GDP and beyond: measuring progress in a changing world'. A consistent, systematic approach will perhaps be more crucial than anything else in efforts to improve the way quality of life is measured.
Finally, I would like to offer my resolute support to Mrs Pack for choosing Sarajevo as European capital of culture.
Finally, I would like to put the following question to those Member States which are saying that less and less money should go to the EU, but which, at the same time, are giving all kinds of new priorities to the EU: if you want less money to go to the EU, what are the priorities that we as the EU should work on? Because if you want the EU to receive less money, you also have to make choices.
Finally, I would like to report on the issues which were given to the Hungarian Presidency as homework by the previous European Councils, and more specifically: what results and achievements will be presented at the summit starting tomorrow, because, after all, we had to make a deal about specific dossiers with you and we had to reach agreement on other issues as well.
Finally, I would like to say that I also believe it would be useful to involve the Council Presidency in such discussions. I can assure you I will follow this up with them, and I am sure I will find a common language with the Presidency on this issue as well.
Finally, I would like to say that we will make clear our absolute respect for proper court proceedings, without passing comment.
Finally, I would like to stress that the preparation of integrated strategic planning should be complemented by flexible financial engineering so that national, regional and local authorities are free to implement their priorities.
Finally, I would like to stress that, in the current circumstances, Syria's application for a seat on the UN's Human Rights Council is unacceptable.
Finally, I would like to thank everyone who has helped in the preparation of this report, namely the shadow rapporteurs, first of all in ITRE, and then the rapporteurs and their groups who have drafted their opinions. I would like to thank all the members who have participated in debates and who have tabled amendments, the Council and the European Commission - we have worked well together and exchanged positions regularly and in good time.
Finally, I would like to thank not only this House - which I have done already - but also our partners in the trio, Spain and Belgium, for their excellent cooperation and for the fact that we were able to complete the 18-month trio programme, and may I wish Poland all the best and a Parliament-friendly Presidency.
Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation and to wish the Commissioner luck with the huge task - as I know - of making the other Commissioners in the Commission College aware of the importance of culture and young people.
Finally, I would like to urge the Commission not to let this process drag on. We must ensure that we do not allow the negotiations to slow down.
Finally, I would stress the important point, directed at the Council, to pressure it not to make mere arithmetical cuts and, if it does so, to explain what the priorities established were.
Finally, I would stress the rapporteur's idea that the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) should ensure adequate levels of funding for GNSS research and development, as well as for its implementation.
Finally, Madam President, I would point out that if we in Parliament want to escape the influence of lobbyists to a greater extent in future, then we will need greater supports and more staff, enabling us to achieve more for the citizens of the European Union.
Finally, Madam President, one more question: what is the state of play when it comes to the launch of the European Asylum Support Office in Malta? I have heard that there is still a possibility of it getting off the ground.
Finally, Mrs Gyõri, thank you very much for your kind mention of Portugal and the Schengen Information System (SIS) one-for-all scheme, which has facilitated the entry of several countries, including yours, into the Schengen area.
Finally, a credible budget must be coherent and guarantee efficient expenditure by avoiding any duplication in the use of funds.
Finally, a word about Greece, because I hope Member States will also have the occasion to discuss at the highest level this situation, which is important not only for a Member State of our Union but, I believe, for the stability of the euro area and for the stability of the European Union as a whole.
Finally, an embargo on which the Commission gives assurances that there would be no impact on Inuit traditional hunting is unrealistic.
Finally, another example is the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which offers real solidarity for European workers.
Finally, as it is still too complicated to implement the territorial cooperation programmes, we asked for them to be simplified and stressed the specific nature of the programmes associated with this objective, which are, by their very nature, international programmes.
Finally, as part of the European budget, the European Development Fund is obviously subject to democratic control, but that must not lead to the total budget for development cooperation being cut.
Finally, as regards any changes in the Schengen system, such a decision should be taken at a European level and not left in the hands of any single country.
Finally, as regards, in particular, the proposal to create an intermediate support category, which both I and my political group and a large majority in Parliament have always supported, I should like to stress that I absolutely agree with the opinion expressed today by Commissioner Hahn.
Finally, cohesion policy is one of solidarity and redistribution, to enable regions to get up to speed and to catch up. It cannot replace any other strategy like, for instance, Europe 2020, which should have its own funding, separate from the cohesion funding, even if these two policies must naturally be coordinated and harmonised.
Finally, coordination among the national authorities responsible for applying what we call 'backstop' solutions, which are to be imposed on banks that fail this test, has been significantly enhanced and improved.
Finally, discharge cannot be a time for discussing detailed policy requiring broad consensus, in particular revision of the Treaties.
Finally, faced with the 'brain-drain' phenomenon, it is important to encourage the retention of researchers in Europe.
Finally, given the importance of this problem, I call on the Commission to draw up a plan for tackling it at EU level that takes into account the full extent of this problem of combating antibiotic resistance, above all, the link between animal health and antibiotic use, and the link between animal and human health.
Finally, however, I would like to give my support to the amended petition by Mr Jahr which calls for specific and effective tools to allow influence, monitoring and correction as far back as the planning and early stages of such projects.
Finally, in a context in which a significant part of the economy depends on multinational companies, there is also a need for organisations to be socially responsible.
Finally, in the context of a rise in power of a largely American global mainstream as regards cultural leisure, it is urgent to remind the European Union and Member States of the importance of providing themselves with tools enabling them to defend and promote the diversity of European cultures and of third countries.
Finally, it focuses on core themes that the Union must play a role in advancing, as is its custom: development, human rights and climate change.
Finally, it is crucial that there be regulation mechanisms to improve first-sale prices, and to promote the fair and appropriate distribution of added value along the fisheries sector value chain, in a way that acknowledges the prices paid to producers.
Finally, it is important that these European programmes receive the funding they need to be brought to fruition.
Finally, it is important to point out that research, innovation and training should be supported so that our SMEs can enjoy the full benefit from the Single Market.
Finally, it is not for Parliament but for the competent judicial authorities to decide, whilst respecting all democratic guarantees, to what extent French law on incitement to racial hatred has been broken and what the judicial consequences might be. Having considered all the arguments, the Committee on Legal Affairs recommends that the European Parliament should waive the parliamentary immunity of Bruno Gollnisch.
Finally, it is not for Parliament but for the competent judicial authorities to decide, whilst respecting all democratic guarantees, to what extent French law on incitement to racial hatred has been broken and what the judicial consequences might be. It is noted that by adopting a decision to waive the Member's immunity, the European Parliament is allowing the competent national authority to hold the person accountable (given that there is no interference with the functioning and independence of the institution) and by no means does this decision confirm the Member's guilt or express an opinion as to whether certain actions or views justify investigation.
Finally, it is unacceptable that the provision of natural resources should be used as a political instrument.
Finally, it needs to be emphasised that we are approaching a decisive stage of the legislative process, and time is becoming a major factor.
Finally, let me quote Jana Mittermaier of Transparency International: 'The new register will be a test of the commitment of all parties involved in lobbying to greater openness.' You could not say it more succinctly.
Finally, let me recall that on 10 June, we will organise the wrap-up event of the Green Paper consultation to which several Members of this Parliament have been invited, some of you as speakers. I would like to inform the Members of the House that more than 1 300 responses to the online questionnaire were received.
Finally, macroregions are very effective, and here I would like to suggest to the Commissioner that, following the example of other strategies, we create a strategy for the Carpathians, one of the largest regions of the European Union and one of the best endowed in terms of natural riches.
Finally, my other question relates to the timing, and you spoke about the difficulty with the Commission and the budgetary authority.
Finally, on resources, although we do not need resources for this particular subject of environmental economic accounts, I agree with Mr Martin that we need sufficient resources.
Finally, on the subject of youth unemployment, which is mentioned under letters F and G of the report, this is also a significant problem.
Finally, one of the most important disadvantages of the report is that it calls for the Member States to ensure 'mutual recognition of certificates and diplomas among the Member States', thereby putting pressure on them to recognise diplomas from various Greek or foreign colleges as 'equivalent' to a degree from a State university.
Finally, please believe me when I say that I will not allow a watered-down stress test to take place.
Finally, since I have a few seconds left, I would like to applaud the work done by Mr Piebalgs, which I think has been exceptional.
Finally, that is also the reason why we call on the Ukrainian authorities to avoid any perception of judicial measures being used selectively and insist that the maximum transparency of investigations, persecutions and trials be guaranteed; we also call on the Commission to assist in the reform of the judiciary in Ukraine by making use of EU capacity-building programmes and to consider creating a high-level EU advisory group for Ukraine to assist the country in its efforts to align itself with EU legislation, including on the judiciary.
Finally, the Commission and the Council should, in the context of their respective competences, keep Parliament informed at all stages of the procedures relating to the protocol and its eventual renewal.
Finally, the Commission should propose measures to ensure an adequate level of financing without diminishing the other funds allocated to transport policy.
Finally, the EU should stimulate and help Russia to come to terms with its totalitarian legacy.
Finally, the European Parliament decides whether or not to grant discharge to an agency, on the basis of the fairly brief reports by the external auditor, and depends on the goodwill of the Executive Director to be given additional information. I believe it is imperative to fill this gap in the legislation on Internal Audit Service (IAS) reports on the agencies and to propose a solution that will see Parliament granted real powers.
Finally, the Green Paper poses the question of how European Union financing would be used to support small and medium-sized enterprises as well.
Finally, the ban on excessive charges for using certain payment methods and on the use of pre-ticked boxes is excellent news from this directive for consumers.
Finally, the commonly recognised goal of joint meetings - that of exchanging arguments and opinions in advance to 'prepare the ground' for plenary when the matter at hand is of major importance - is attainable only if committees remain jointly responsible in all stages of the procedure right up to the adoption of the act.
Finally, the introduction of a trust mark system would ensure additional consumer protection.
Finally, the issue of the IMF's place within the United Nations system will also have to be raised, and if the Europeans do put forward a candidate, they must ensure that the mandate that they give to that person is structured in such a way as to enable him or her to push for a form of global governance that rises to the post-crisis challenges that we face.
Finally, the measures, which, in my view, run contrary to the spirit of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, have hit the weakest countries, including Greece, Portugal and Spain, while the stronger, wealthier countries have not yet taken on their share of the burden.
Finally, the motion calls for greater transparency and efficiency in the European Union's administration processes, urging the Commission to be accountable to Parliament for its work.
Finally, the rapporteur also covered one fundamental issue: opposition to absolute strategic autonomy as the final outcome of the CSDP.
Finally, the request for appropriate sustainability criteria for biomass produced for the use of energy is also important.
Finally, the right to self-defence has been sanctioned and weapons may be kept in the home even without a licence.
Finally, the transfer of funds unspent at European Union level to the EU budget rather than returning them to the Member States represents a source of considerable 'savings'.
Finally, the transparency of the procedure, and public participation and scrutiny thereof, are of crucial importance to ensuring, as far as possible, the transparency, quality and independence of the study.
Finally, there are some critics who believe that we should not follow the bilateral path in the negotiations and enter into bilateral agreements.
Finally, this report reminds us that the European Commission needs to ensure that promoting innovation does not endanger the progress made in basic research.
Finally, this report shows once more that there is still a long way to go with regard to management of the EDF and their proper use, which is why I agree with all the rapporteur's conclusions and congratulate him on his work.
Finally, we also need our own resources, and the sooner we have them, the less time we will have or need for debating budgets every year.
Finally, we anticipate the abolition of the requirement of prior declaration of goods on the condition that the EU and Andorra guarantee in their respective territories an equivalent level of security as set out in the relevant acquis.
Finally, we believe that in order to make the European Union budget more equitable and transparent, the existing exceptions and correction mechanisms should be progressively phased out.
Finally, we call on the Commission to transpose the Union's innovation policy into an action plan with specific objectives and measurable targets.
Finally, we do not believe it is wrong for Parliament to award cultural prizes.
Finally, we know too that the issue of Greece will be also on the agenda of the European Council.
Finally, we maintain that it is important to launch a comprehensive analysis to obtain a more precise identification of the possible scenarios and means for operation and exploitation after 2013, which includes all commercial aspects of the exploitation as well as the legal, contractual and financing structures of the different exploitation models that will ensure that a stable governance model is put into place.
Finally, we must come to the aid of innovative SMEs by facilitating their access to diverse forms of financing.
Finally, we must promote a system for protecting intellectual property rights that is balanced and respects inventors' rights while, at the same time, offering our citizens the widest possible access to knowledge: such are the challenges to be met and which innovation could contribute towards in future.
Finally, we must severely punish those involved in this system.
Finally, we should also simplify and improve the system for recognising vocational qualifications in Europe, in order to revive the Internal Market and provide our fellow citizens with the keys to enhanced professional mobility.
Finally, we should also use the summit to reconfirm our political commitment to make progress on crisis management cooperation - provided our decision-making autonomy is in no way affected.
Finally, we very often emphasise in Parliament that people are the most important.
Finally, we wish to stress the role of lifelong training in this sector, which is experiencing rapid changes. I now turn to the 'Youth on the Move' scheme.
Finally, what will the consequences be if you find errors and weak points? There is the risk that we will not be able to do anything at a European level and that it will all come to nothing.
Finally, you quite rightly hoped for a strategy to recapitalise and restructure failing banks, as Mrs Ferreira proposed in her report on crisis management.
Financial consolidation is essential for correcting the errors of the past, and for a sustained growth of Europe's economies that is not supported by public and foreign debt, but rather by the promotion of employment and competitiveness.
Financial control of the implementation of the Community budget takes place at three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control by the European Court of Auditors; and the discharge procedure of the European Parliament.
Financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control, carried out by the EU Court of Auditors; and a discharge procedure carried out by the European Parliament.
Financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control, carried out by the European Court of Auditors; and a discharge procedure carried out by Parliament.
Financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control, carried out by the European Court of Auditors; and a discharge procedure carried out by Parliament. I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of Frontex's budget for the financial year 2009 because the audits carried out by the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control showed that the Agency's transactions were all perfectly legal and regular.
Financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control, carried out by the European Court of Auditors; and a discharge procedure carried out by the European Parliament.
Financial institutions should give greater attention to the implementation of measures to raise awareness about the risks, as better information about risk at all levels of society - and among employees - is often crucial in improving risk management.
Financial markets and institutions have to take into account, as part of their corporate social responsibility, the interests of all parties involved, including clients, shareholders and employees.
Financial support and the simplification of legislative procedures for scientific development should be a priority for the EU. To stand still is to move backwards.
Financing of euro bail-outs should be left to those countries that actually wanted to join the euro in the first place.
Financing the new priorities - R&D, innovation, and energy and transportation networks - will be unrealistic while retaining the present level of resources.
Findings from the data available from 10 Member States will be published as soon as possible.
First and foremost is the idea that there should be incentives to stimulate sustainability, not just higher duties.
First and foremost, it is about building on the SME base, which is the main generator of wealth in Europe, through venture capital, guarantee facilities, assistance with loans and simplification of the legislative environment.
First let me start with our clarification concerning the asylum package, as I received very concrete questions on that.
First of all, I call on the High Representative to urgently press the Sudanese authorities to release the Christian, Hawa Abdalla Muhammad Saleh, who was arrested by the security service in a refugee camp in Darfur on religious grounds on 25 May.
First of all, I think that it should be mandatory.
First of all, I wish to congratulate Mr Feio on his excellent report. I believe that the ratio of debt to GDP should be reduced at a 'satisfactory pace'. In this sense, the differential between current government debt and the 60% reference value should be reduced by one-twentieth per year. I welcome Mr Feio's amendment to the initial Commission proposal, according to which the reduction should be calculated at an average rate of one-twentieth per year over the previous three years. I also agree that the assessment of compliance with this condition should begin three years after the closure of the excessive deficit procedures currently under way.
First of all, I would like express my sincerest gratitude to Baroness Ashton for the EU's full support to Estonia in trying to resolve the hostage crisis in Lebanon.
First of all, Italy blocked the imposition of sanctions, then France recognised the transitional council in Benghazi without any consultation and, finally, Germany abstained during the vote on the resolution in the UN Security Council.
First of all, an explicit reminder of the added value of European territorial cooperation and of its potential for increased competitiveness. A proposal to increase its funding to 7% of the next budget for cohesion policy.
First of all, despite its bulk, I cannot find anywhere in this report a single serious attempt to make proposals for structural savings, for example, the abolition of what, in my view, are totally superfluous European institutions, such as the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and a good few European agencies of all kinds.
First of all, if we are going to discuss the content of a constitution, we should not single out one constitution of one Member State.
First of all, it underlines that impact assessment can never be a substitute for political debate and the legislator's decision-making process, but should only help the technical preparation of political decisions.
First of all, the European parties are, as you know, recognised as important entities by the Treaty that was ratified unanimously by our Member States.
First of all, the report sets out the general requirements for IAs at European level.
First of all, there is only one version - at least, I have only had access to an English version - which does not give us an exact picture of what happened.
First of all, we appreciate the efforts of the Commission to improve financial management, but at the same time we regret that Member States do not draw in full the financial assets of the European Social Fund notwithstanding the financial crisis.
First of all, we are in a situation - and this report points this out - in which wireless broadband through the 800 MHz allocation for mobile communications across Europe will be a reality.
First of all, we need to ensure that funding is made easier and there need to be more subsidies and incentives for venture capital.
First of all, we need to reflect on the causes of this outbreak and the factors that have stood in the way of fighting it. Are there too many antibiotics in cattle fodder? Is it the case that the over-intensive nature of agriculture does not do us any favours? To what extent do we need better labelling and tracing? These are important questions, especially now, when the review of the common agricultural policy is on the horizon.
First of all, when it comes to the increase in oil prices, there are actually two sectors which are exempt from all energy taxes already and those are aviation and shipping - including fisheries.
First of all, while we appreciate that the final text may be improved by the votes tomorrow, it is strong enough, and we would simply underline that the role of the International Labour Organisation should be strengthened.
First, I would like to ask you to inquire from your colleagues in the Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs about the work of Minister for National Economy György Matolcsy, because the atmosphere in the hearing yesterday was slightly different from what you have talked about here today. I would also recommend that you read the responses of the Member States to the Commission's proposals concerning the European semester.
First, both the Commission and Parliament need to reflect closely, together with the Council, on how the responsibility of the various financial actors can be better defined and outlined in the legislative framework.
First, however, I would like to congratulate the Hungarian Presidency on its great work and express my thanks for it. In particular, I would like to thank Minister of State Enikő Győri, who was always present everywhere, for her work.
First, however, let me say one thing about the permanent debate on Strasbourg versus Brussels. I am a definite advocate of Strasbourg and I believe that if there is any doubt then we should move the entire parliament to Strasbourg, not to Brussels.
First, on proportionality: just to make it clear, a European Arrest Warrant can be issued to prosecute offences which are punishable by at least 12 months' imprisonment, or to execute a sentence to at least 4 months' imprisonment.
First, the Commission calls on the EU Member States to exercise a proportionality test when they call for an Arrest Warrant, and to fill the gaps where their legislation fails to fully comply with the framework decision setting up the Arrest Warrant.
First, the IMF has played a key role, in cooperation with the European Union, in overcoming the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, for which Dominique Strauss-Kahn made a major contribution as the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund.
First, the adoption of information and communication technology and the development of technologies such as online administration or cloud computing, which save money, reduce costs and effort and, therefore, improve the competitiveness of SMEs.
First, trilingualism would have a negative impact on the competitiveness of companies in the Member States not represented in the system.
First, we can see great similarities between Member States with regard to public debts and deficit ratios, while, at the same time, for the same Member States, there are substantial differences between the risk premiums paid on their sovereign debt.
First, we need to be aware that cities are an important platform for implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, for reasons that include their undeniable importance in the economic development of Europe's regions.
First: the European Union will strive to encourage Russia to resolve the last remaining outstanding multilateral issues to facilitate WTO accession before the end of 2011, building on the EU-Russia bilateral agreement reached in 2004 and last December.
Firstly I should like to thank everyone who worked on the report and to congratulate the European Food Safety Authority itself, which has respected the need to provide high-quality, independent advice in order to guarantee compliance with safety standards as well as scientific excellence and independence on all matters with a direct or indirect impact on food safety.
Firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Stavrakakis, for his excellent work. I voted in favour today of granting discharge to the European Maritime Safety Agency in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009. I would, however, like to draw attention to the fact that the Court of Auditors noted a high number of budget transfers in 2009 and add my voice to the request made to the Agency to work on improving its future budgetary planning and monitoring in order to reduce the number of budget transfers.
Firstly let me point out that the stress test is uncharted territory for us. You are well aware of this.
Firstly that Objective 1 funds, for the convergence regions, not be reduced - I would even like to see them increased - by the savings made as a result of certain regions no longer being under Objective 1. These savings must benefit the new intermediary regions of course, but also the other regions.
Firstly, European consumers must be able to know what they are eating.
Firstly, I believe that we should create the inventory proposed in Article 8; it is preferable to rely on a precise, expertly prepared inventory so as to identify new bands before explicitly mentioning harmonised frequency bands.
Firstly, I believe there is no such thing as zero risk, either in this field, or in the environmental field. I think it is very difficult to predict the future, and we know after all, Mr Zemke, that the markets move much more quickly than the age of democracy, than our age, no matter how quickly we move or how quickly and effectively we want to move.
Firstly, I should like to come back to Mr Schmidt's speech so as to discuss the process again.
Firstly, I strongly support the need to improve dialogue between the labour market and the educational system by increasing the number of traineeships available in businesses, in order to enable students to become actively involved in the business world and also to strengthen links between businesses and educational institutions with regard to vocational training. I also think it is a good idea to integrate educational systems more at international level, firstly, to ensure that people's qualifications are fully recognised, and secondly, to promote cross-border mobility projects.
Firstly, I welcome the commitment in the report to at least maintaining the CAP and cohesion funding at present levels in the next perspective.
Firstly, I would like to congratulate the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) on the important work that it has been carrying out to reduce the quantity of drugs and of related phenomena in Europe. I agree with the participation of Croatia in the EMCDDA's activities, given the fact that the country has become part of a transit route through which illicit drugs are smuggled, due to its strategic location, and I believe that the adoption of the European programme will lead to the improvement of health care and social peace, at both European and international level.
Firstly, I would like to thank you. I would like to make that clear at the outset. I would like to include my fellow Members who have worked very well together and who have supported Parliament's position very strongly.
Firstly, Japan's protectionist policy in the automotive sector concerns us, because there is an imbalance between exports and imports.
Firstly, Mrs Figueiredo, in relation to issues of global financial regulation, as you know, since the G20 was established as the principal economic forum for global governance in financial matters, it is the G20 that is given precedence on these issues.
Firstly, among these parties, I must mention former South African President and President of the African Union, Thabo Mbeki, and the mediation he performed, and I think we should also emphasise the mediation role that our own special representative to Sudan, Rosalind Marsden, has played.
Firstly, any measures taken must be based on sound scientific evidence; secondly, they must be proportionate; and, thirdly, they should not place a further burden of regulation, and thereby cost, on the agricultural and veterinary industries.
Firstly, as you wanted, the stress tests for 2011 have undergone genuine improvements, particularly in six areas that I would like to inform you about briefly.
Firstly, do all banks have to be stress-tested? Secondly, can we be assured that the stress tests from now on will reflect the true position of banks? And thirdly, what authority does the European Banking Authority have to impose its authority on errant banks, banks that are over-exposed, banks behaving recklessly, and so on?
Firstly, for demanding accountability on the relief which Member States grant to small truck manufacturers.
Firstly, if the CAP is to contribute towards the achievement of the Europe 2020 objectives, the EU agricultural budget for the next financing period should be maintained at least at the same level as the 2013 agricultural budget.
Firstly, in the event of cross-border problems, the law is often not even applied in many cases, as a result of the less than ideal cooperation between the authorities in the different Member States, and, therefore, these cases are not investigated at all.
Firstly, it is not a particularly quick solution: almost a year after the disaster, we have no positive sign of the waiver that the Union must obtain from the WTO before its proposal can enter into force, we have not finished our work as legislators, and we have still to hold negotiations in the Council.
Firstly, it is possible to circumvent the Waste Shipments Regulation by claiming that the articles being exported are second-hand goods rather than waste.
Firstly, let me mention the major elements as regards increased transparency and accountability.
Firstly, minimum rules on the right to interpretation and translation, which were adopted already in 2010.
Firstly, not with more Europe or more money for Europe, but with a better Europe, a Europe with an added value, and Europe should not interfere with matters, such as sport or tourism, which Member States can deal with perfectly well on their own.
Firstly, of having tried to block this issue, despite it being dependent on a World Trade Organisation (WTO) waiver and, in truth, of voting on an issue that can be rendered toothless by a lack of that waiver.
Firstly, on cohesion policy, which is key to regional development. I believe that we need to maintain the cohesion policy budget and create an equitable aid model for all regions with intermediary income so as to make future EU investments in the regions transparent and fair.
Firstly, on the extraction of oil sands, which damages local diversity, we insist on the EU's right to use the Fuel Quality Directive to inhibit their use. I was pleased to hear what the Commissioner had to say on that matter.
Firstly, on the subject of Syria, like Mr Verhofstadt, I would like to know what is stopping Europe from placing President Assad on the EU sanctions list? Which country or countries are currently preventing the European Union from taking the only possible decision? Please tell us. If Mr Westerwelle is the obstacle, then tell us that it is Mr Westerwelle: at least that way, we will know what is shaping different Member States' policy.
Firstly, putting education and training at the heart of our strategy.
Firstly, regarding agriculture - which I mentioned earlier - we call on the Commission to ensure that none of the agreement's provisions, either on the liberalisation of agricultural trade or on intellectual property rights, threaten small-scale farming in India. I am thinking of the provisions on seeds, for example.
Firstly, textile products comprising non-textile parts of animal origin - fur and leather - must show this information on the labels in order to allow consumers to make informed choices.
Firstly, the Commission, Member States and their organisations must provide consumers with information upstream.
Firstly, the European Court of Auditors found serious irregularities in several procurement procedures, including in one IT contract worth around EUR 30 million.
Firstly, the European Union is getting over the failure of the Lisbon strategy, which was devised by the European Council in 2000 with a view to making the European Union the world's knowledge-based economy by 2010.
Firstly, the completely new system it provides should enable us to recognise macroeconomic imbalances at an early stage; and secondly, we should then be able to act quickly.
Firstly, the creation of a category of 'intermediate regions' within cohesion policy in order to ensure that the distribution of Structural Funds matches more closely the real economic and social situation of the territories; and secondly, a renewed call for the creation of a tax on financial transactions as a new resource to safeguard European economic policies.
Firstly, the early years of childhood are critical for cognitive, sensory and motor development.
Firstly, the fact that existing regulations or directives are examined to see how well they are working in practice or how well they are achieving their objectives and are then improved or interpreted more precisely where necessary is not an argument against European policy, but rather an argument in favour of such policy.
Firstly, the idea is to link research and innovation by bringing together all the relevant European Union instruments into a common strategic framework allowing for the introduction of genuinely cross-cutting strategies that cover the entire range of innovation systems, from research to technological development, demonstration and the market.
Firstly, the link between the Cohesion Funds and the Framework Programme for research must be improved. I must stress the importance of the cohesion policy as it has become a major source of support in Europe for research and innovation.
Firstly, the over one thousand agreements already in existence must be retained.
Firstly, the question of the operation of European Union missions.
Firstly, the review has made clear that the distribution of research funds continues to be too concentrated, and we cannot afford to lose sight of this.
Firstly, their intrinsic value in the recreation of cultural templates and in contributing to the construction of a common European identity.
Firstly, there are the tariff negotiations where we have made some good progress quickly over the last few months and I am confident that India will significantly improve its offer, but a few sectors remain very difficult; notably, cars, and wine and spirits.
Firstly, there is no mention in the text of the effects of illegal trade on small businesses.
Firstly, there is the decline in fish stocks; secondly, the general fall in prices in precisely the area where fish stocks are healthy and supply is too high; and thirdly - and this is what we are concerned about today - operating costs are higher as a result of rising crude oil prices.
Firstly, there is the view that goes: we now have an agreement which is the most extensive in the world.
Firstly, to achieve our goals of a more sustainable green transport system and thus implement the 'polluter pays' principle.
Firstly, to come back immediately to the issue raised just now by Mrs Gáll-Pelcz, who talked about the responsibility of the Commission - I am used to facing up to my responsibilities - I would point out that these stress tests that are being performed today have been designed by, and are the responsibility of, the new authority that we have created together, the European Banking Authority.
Firstly, uneven geographical participation and poor participation in projects by researchers from certain parts of the Union, especially those from the less developed regions and from the countries which joined the EU in 2004 or later.
Firstly, we have the economic governance package. I would like to thank this Parliament very sincerely for the extremely hard work and commitment it has shown in maintaining a high level of ambition on this issue.
Firstly, we need a vision for Europe and we need to decide what added value the European budget brings to that vision for Europe? Secondly, yes, Mr Ashworth, the budget should be renewed and made greener, it should be a forward-looking budget.
Firstly, we need to encourage the mobility and attractiveness of cultural factors, such as the mobility of artists, cultural workers and works of art and, secondly, we need to ensure that specific funding and economic support policies are put in place in the cultural sector, such as access to funds via the European Investment Bank.
Firstly, we need to have a much sounder basis for the requirement for a proportionality check, so that minor offences are not covered.
Firstly, we need to have better access to credit and financial support; we need more investment in scientific research and development; clear rules offering long-term prospects in terms of innovation; simplified procedures for accessing European and national support programmes; and cheap, simple European patents.
Firstly, we should note the need to maintain the institutional balance enshrined in the Treaty, within which framework the European Commission proposes laws and Parliament and the Council adopt them.
Firstly, will these tests have to be carried out by German nuclear plants which have been shut down? Secondly, what will be the consequences of the closure of German nuclear power plants for the internal European energy market?
Firstly, with regard to carbon leakage, the Commission would like to stress that in the latest amendment of the ETS Directive the European Parliament and the Council have decided to tackle this issue by allocating a higher share of free allowances for sectors and subsectors deemed to be at a significant risk of carbon leakage.
Firstly, with regard to points 24 and 25 in the report concerning children staying at school and increasing their attendance at school, I would like to ask the following question.
Fisheries partnership agreements have the aim of conserving and safeguarding activities in the EU's fisheries and developing relations with third countries with a view to reinforcing sustainable exploitation of resources outside Union waters. I have voted in favour of the Council's recommendation for Parliament to support the conclusion of the agreement in question.
Fishermen's incomes are also dependent on the price of oil.
Fishing is a particularly important part of the economy, but it should also be stressed that fishing has a cultural value, which is passed on from generation to generation.
Fishing is an important economic sector for the European Union and needs to receive support at a time when the average price of a barrel of oil will remain at USD 80-100.
Fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for by the EU-Seychelles Fisheries Partnership Agreement (
Five men were arrested under the Terrorism Act outside the Sellafield nuclear plant on 2 May, and the Irish Government has not yet stated whether the British Government shared all the security information about the incident with it.
Flexibility is important because the situation varies in the different Member States. I also welcome the measures proposed in the report supporting young people in the agricultural sector. I believe that this offers an effective method of combating depopulation in rural areas.
Flexible rules for sanctions, complaints and compensation mechanisms are necessary in order to adapt to the changing market conditions and new market practices.
Focusing the funds' joint action at regional or local level enhances their added value and permits stakeholders to fine-tune specific actions to the real economic and social needs and, therefore, to the employment situation in each specific region.
Following Member States and waiting for permission from Foreign Ministers to go ahead has become Lady Ashton's doctrine and she treats it as virtue.
Following a credible referendum at the beginning of this year, we commended Sudanese parties on the remarkable job they did in organising the referendum.
Following an internal notification OLAF decided to open an investigation, and therefore, in order to be in possession of all the necessary facts, we would like to await the result of this investigation before we grant discharge.
Following careful examination, the EU committee responsible recognised that these countries have fulfilled all the criteria for membership of the Schengen area: they offer sufficient assurances as regards the protection of national borders on land, at sea and in the air and they have mastered the Schengen Information System for data exchange and reliably ensure data protection.
Following efforts and actions made by some Member States in the HRC, today Syria has stated that it is withdrawing its candidacy to become a member of the UNHRC.
Following long negotiations between the various institutions, this new legal framework will ensure clear and common conditions for citizens and businesses in the EU. Cross-border commercial transactions and online transactions are now harmonised, so ensuring greater security and transparency for EU consumers and businesses.
Following recent events which have highlighted the potential abuses of lobbying, it has appeared all the more necessary to increase transparency regarding the work of interest groups at the European institutions.
Following the Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Applications, published by the Commission on 14 June 2010 with a view to increasing the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), efforts should be made to extend the navigation system to cover the entire EU. Indeed, the expansion of this system can offer huge advantages for the economy and security.
Following the New Deal policy model from the United States, the solution to the current economic and financial crisis will involve restoring economic growth based on investments and creating new jobs.
Following the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union, both countries' marine areas are part of the pan-European waters and the regulations are directly applicable in their national legislations.
Following the adoption of a motion this week, I am delighted that the Parliament calls on the Commission to introduce emergency measures, including raising the current ceiling for State aid from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per company for a transitional period of three years.
Following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament's powers have been strengthened, making it colegislator in almost all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure.
Following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union's diplomatic activities have been beefed up with a view to raising Europe's profile on the international stage. I welcome the adoption of this report, which calls for better representation for the Community institutions in international organisations.
Following the agreement last December of an overall EUR 85 billion assistance programme for Ireland, the Irish authorities have undertaken a great deal of work to implement the adjustment programme to which the financial support was attached.
Following the debate, the resolution adopted criticised the idea put forward by certain Member States of freezing the EU budget at 2013 levels, given the financial difficulties that many EU countries have faced in recent times.
Following the disastrous euro rescue package, which simply involved the net contributors taking a hit for the mismanagement and corruption in a few southern states, the plan is now to ask the already overburdened citizens of the net contributor countries to cough up even more money.
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament has strengthened its role in the conclusion of international air agreements.
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, agreements covering a field to which the ordinary legislative procedure applies require Parliament's consent. I voted in favour of this report aimed at setting out some general principles regarding how air agreements should be evaluated, both in terms of substance and the procedures the European Parliament Committee on Transport and Tourism might adopt to ensure that it is well informed throughout the course of negotiations and has an opportunity to express its priorities well before being confronted with the yes/no choice of consent.
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, both institutions need a formal agreement on reviews of expenditure to replace the 30-year-old 'gentlemen's agreement'. Citizens have the right to demand transparency as far as the Council's and Parliament's finances are concerned.
Following the failure of Europe's market share in the growing satellite navigation systems market to live up to expectations, in June last year, the Commission brought forward an action plan on global navigation satellite system (GNSS) applications.
Following the floods that devastated a vast portion of Pakistan's territory last summer, the Commission tabled a proposal to grant the country extensive autonomous trade preferences in the form of exemption from customs duties, affecting 75 product lines of interest to Pakistan: essentially textiles and clothing.
Following the increase in Parliament's powers under the Treaty of Lisbon, it has become essential, in the interests of transparency, to establish a common register between Parliament and the Commission for the registration and monitoring of organisations and individuals participating in the development and implementation of EU policy.
Following the positive results of the evaluations and follow-up visits by teams of experts, it can be concluded that although some issues remain outstanding and regular reports and future follow-up visits are being demanded, these do not constitute an obstacle to the full accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area.
Following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament is a colegislator in almost all areas.
Following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament's powers have been strengthened and it is now colegislator in many areas under the ordinary legislative procedure.
Following the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, the powers of the European Parliament have been enhanced and this is attracting increasing numbers of representatives asking for intervention.
Following the relevant expert evaluations, and in spite of the fact that there are still some problems to be resolved, both countries have shown they are prepared to implement the provisions of the Schengen acquis and can therefore fully accede to it.
Following the visits made on the ground and the technical evaluations which were carried out, not only the rapporteur appointed by the European Parliament but the group of experts, too, concluded that Romania fulfils all the criteria for joining the Schengen area, which were provisions assumed through the Treaty of Accession in 2005.
Following this act, the Union must use this new ambition in the service of effective multilateralism, with the full strength of its values at the core.
Following this, the Commission will present its proposals on the reform of the common agricultural policy in the second half of 2011, in order to ensure that we can coordinate the submission of legislative proposals at budget level while taking into account our ambitions for the future common agricultural policy.
Following those negotiations, we now have three new elements, which require us to turn our attention to the evaluation of the programme.
Following today's vote on labelling, consumers will no longer face the risk of mistakenly buying textiles containing real leather or fur. I believe that consumers have the right to know what the products they buy are made from, and this report ensures that any animal-derived materials will be indicated on textile product labels.
Following various reports and in-depth debates, Parliament launched its register for representatives of interest groups in 1996.
Following very fruitful cooperation between the three institutions, I believe we have reached our common objective, namely, the establishment of this framework regulation on European environmental economic accounts with its first set of three modules, which cover air emissions accounts, environmentally-related taxes or levies and material flow accounts.
Food security at EU and global level and globalisation necessitate a new and strong common agricultural policy, which will firstly improve our competitiveness on the international market, secondly ensure a fair income for farmers, thirdly ensure that consumers can buy high-quality products at fair prices, fourthly ensure the sustainable development of rural areas and fifthly help to improve the state of the environment.
Food security, food safety, biodiversity, climate change, new technologies and creating a viable, competitive market-led industry have to be the focus.
For Croatian to be an official language, the Treaty has to be modified.
For Greece to start to grow out of the fiscal crisis, part of the debt burden should be forgiven and absorbed by creditors, public and private alike.
For Lithuanians, it is crucial that the sums earmarked for cohesion policy in the next MFF are not smaller than those in this financial period.
For Russia, European scientific and technical progress has been emulated since the time of Peter the Great, but it has simultaneously been feared as something that could potentially destroy the Russian soul and way of being, and viewed as a threat to its territorial integrity.
For a long time, antibiotics were seen as a wonder drug that cured infectious diseases.
For a moment, allow me to deviate from the protocol for the sake of a historic reference.
For a second time, through the use of red tape, it is refusing to allow the registration of an initiative regarding a public referendum on the issue of nuclear power plant construction.
For a year now, the essence of the economic governance package has been applied to my country with disastrous consequences: the recession is getting worse, inflation has gone through the roof, investments have completely dried up, labour rights and collective agreements have basically been repealed, the biggest drop in the cost of labour has been in Europe, unemployment has reached 20% and debt has increased, fuelling a dangerous vicious circle of recession, debt and more borrowing.
For all that, I have no intention of hiding the fact that my group had major problems with the original Commission proposal and also with the rapporteur's position at first reading.
For all their diversity, Europeans share a great number of strong values, such as respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law, which must be extended to the international stage.
For all these reasons, I shall be voting in favour of this motion for a resolution.
For all these reasons, even though I am under no illusions about its realisation, I voted for Mrs Niebler's report.
For all these reasons, we consider this report a long way from what is needed for a better, fairer future for Europe and its citizens.
For businessmen and women, it is important to have the chance to explore new markets, to sell their goods and services, and they are in the gift of our Member States, some of whom have long relationships with the countries concerned, but who now need to step up and provide those opportunities.
For companies within EU countries, there would be gains if we could tackle barriers to public procurement, to the medical devices market - where there is insufficient recognition of international standards, to services - including financial services and postal services, and access for SMEs.
For effective use to be made of all funds, this is a priority. I also appeal to the Commission to simplify the concept of cohesion policy and focus it on results, and not on complicated monitoring procedures.
For example, EUR 34 billion left the six Irish domestic banks in the last three months of 2010, forcing them to rely on what is supposedly short-term funding from the ECB to the tune of EUR 160 billion.
For example, I cannot agree that registration is de facto mandatory when only registered lobbyists have access to Parliament.
For example, I met a school secretary who paid over EUR 2 000 because the school could not afford to pay it as she felt responsible because she had signed the form.
For example, Parliament refused to come together in good time prior to this historic Council meeting to adopt a resolution to address the problems relating precisely to this historic crisis. I found it very regrettable that even those Members on the left who sit here to my right were not able to gather themselves together in good time to make a statement on behalf of Parliament with regard to Greece.
For example, a literary work, or even a work of art or music is, first and foremost, an essential manifestation of the talent of the artist and a social response.
For example, cohesion policy and structural funds are key to encouraging growth in our regions.
For example, direct aid will no longer simply be based on a premium per hectare, but the size of the farm, employment arrangements, labour productivity and legal form will also be taken into consideration at long last. I am also very pleased that these payments will only be awarded to farmers who are truly active in the sector, so that the aid goes to those who genuinely need it and who use it to benefit agriculture.
For example, does the selection process manage cross-border business and shareholder relations, as well as different business models? Another question is whether it can be stated with absolute certainty that such a series of stress tests will not ignore any bank whose operation might present a risk to the European economy.
For example, doubts still remain about possible conflicts of interest in relation to the assessment of the appetite suppressant benfluorex.
For example, in 2009, the Chinese authorities adopted a system of accreditation of innovative local products, which restricted yet further access on the part of international businesses to the Chinese market.
For example, in order to deal with the problem of the ageing population, we need so-called classic innovations, on the one hand, such as new drugs, and, on the other, we should be thinking about innovative models for society, pensions and healthcare systems.
For example, in the case of Greece, the Memorandum stipulates the following: 'The government shall ensure that company-level agreements take precedence over sectoral agreements, which, in turn, take precedence over occupational agreements.
For example, in the case of the two largest EU projects, which are the global satellite navigation system and the European joint undertaking for ITER and the development of nuclear fusion, I consider it unacceptable that such important projects are literally 'drowning' in deficiencies which any decent manager would know how to resolve.
For example, it calls on the Member States to support doctoral and post-doctoral programmes that will underpin competitiveness and to facilitate 'labour mobility', commonly known as job insecurity.
For example, it hopes for greater integration and common management in crisis situations: recent events in Libya have shown that Europe acts dispersedly, with some Member States directly engaged, others that have wriggled out, and practically only one country - Italy - to manage the direct consequences of the Libyan crisis and the North African crises in general, in other words, a flood of migrants.
For example, it is very strange to propose binding sustainability criteria for a renewable resource like forests, but to not have similar criteria for fossil fuels like coal.
For example, it proposes replacing markings on labels with language-independent symbols to avoid translation of fibre names into several EU languages.
For example, let us create a real Common Foreign and Security Policy to give Europe more influence on the world stage, but also in order to make the best use of public money.
For example, the European Training Foundation and Cedefop, although both working on vocational education and training, have different geographical scope.
For example, the Irish State is on track to owe EUR 750 billion by 2014, and we have a government debt that is more than EUR 120 000 per worker.
For example, the Kremlin has prevented a number of political parties from registering for the State Duma elections on procedural grounds, and the list is likely to be extended to include the People's Freedom Party led by Mikhail Kasyanov, Vladimir Milov, Boris Nemtsov and Vladimir Ryzhkov.
For example, the problem of unemployment requires training for the unemployed, but also needs promotion of enterprise and support for structural infrastructure. A variety of funds come into play, here.
For example, the report fails to recognise that the commercial banks' ability to make money from speculative financial investments was a very important factor in the crisis.
For example, the report presented stresses that, due to complicated rules, there is slow uptake of European Union funds earmarked for TEN and TNI projects and other cohesion policy priorities. I feel that in this area there is an urgent need to ensure the simplification, effectiveness and transparency of procedures.
For example, the report proposes increasing the programme's financing but, at the same time, it proposes identifying common research areas among those which appear most promising in terms of concrete applications, enabling the highest extent of sharing in an ethical context, so that tangible results are achieved when implementing this programme.
For example, the report states that the purpose of development policy should not be to defend the EU's interests, but rather those of the most vulnerable populations on the planet.
For example, there is no right to legal representation, prison conditions are, in some cases, disgraceful and very often the investigations take an extremely long time.
For example, there was a British citizen who, when arrested on the battlefield in Afghanistan carrying weapons and wearing the black turban of the Taliban, gave the explanation that he was in Afghanistan in order to take a computer course.
For example, we feel that this means banning wage dumping and tax dumping, or setting minimum standards to stop competition being distorted on the labour market.
For example, we have left room for manoeuvre with regard to the type of public participation, the education and training of employees and managers and the details of the financial models - not the quality of the financing - and we are deliberately leaving open the regulation of the final storage facilities built and/or operated jointly by several Member States.
For example, we need a clear definition of whistleblowing, we need whistleblowers to have a right to be heard, we need independent points of contact that can provide information on rights, obligations and options, and not least we also need precise handling deadlines for the competent EU institutions.
For example, we should mention that some of the Baltic States have managed to overcome the crisis and that, with European support, Ireland will succeed in returning to the bond markets next year.
For example, we should strengthen the independence of the Impact Assessment Board, which is currently under the authority of the President of the Commission.
For example, when India received a complaint from the World Trade Organisation about the 500% tariffs that it was applying to European wines, it got round it unfairly by having the individual Indian states impose the same tariffs.
For generations, the owners of European forests have complied with the strictest legislation on forests and nature conservation.
For her to say that an MEP's immunity should be waived because the comments for which he or she is being criticised did not come within the scope of his or her parliamentary activities is absolute nonsense from a legal point of view.
For if - and this brings me to my second group of points - in revising the Stability and Growth Pact our only objective is the kind of governance that will satisfy the rating agencies, then we will be missing an important opportunity in the history of our economic and monetary union.
For if we do not assume our responsibility and take a clear line, then we can forget what was said earlier by Ms Toia: we need to be aware that in 2020 - and we set this out in the Digital Agenda - every European should be able to pursue his or her interests via what are ultimately spectrum opportunities.
For instance, American platforms have been enjoying a moratorium since 1998, which has led to their extraordinary boom.
For instance, Lithuania's GDP per capita remains low (when we joined the EU, it was 48% of the Union average). However, it is believed that by 2020, Lithuania's GDP will be at least 50% greater than it was without cohesion policy assistance.
For instance, even a 30% haircut would mean that a large part of the banking system would end up under-capitalised, while a 50% haircut, which many have advocated, would imply that a large part of the Greek banking system would simply become insolvent.
For instance, in the Maghreb countries - as you probably know - the reality is that trade among themselves is almost insignificant.
For instance, it is estimated that in the near future, it will be possible to achieve geographic locations accurate to 45 centimetres.
For instance, some are saying that with the Romanian-Bulgarian accession, the Roma population will begin to move from these two countries. I would like to be very clear: freedom of movement is a basic principle of the European Union, it is effective and valid, it is what our policies are built upon; this freedom is currently enjoyed by the Romanian and Bulgarian Roma population, just as by everyone else in every corner of the European Union.
For instance, the Fatah-Hamas reconciliation would have been inconceivable without the Arab revolution in Egypt and also without the recent bloody repression in Syria.
For instance, the present Commission made the very first legislative proposal on 10 February 2010 - the day after you had voted in favour of setting up the present Commission - when we adopted a regulation on audit powers for Eurostat, which gives Eurostat the possibility of checking and verifying the quality of statistics at the source, which is very important.
For instance, the reciprocity principle should be applied in the context of the legal remedies available in the event of commercial disputes, and there is a need to improve the protection of intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents and geographical indications.
For instance, tourism and recreation can be important drivers of rural economies.
For instance: more open access and dissemination of research results, wider calls in the field of socio-economic sciences, more collaborative research, efforts to improve the mobility of researchers, more actions for innovative SMEs, better coordination with the Member States.
For it is possible to create synergy between Union programmes for the support of culture, such as Culture 2007-2013, for example, with existing Union research programmes (such as the Eighth Framework Programme, which supports the EU's technological development), or to extend the possibilities for spending money from existing funds (such as the European Social Fund, for example). We also recommend supporting the development of new and innovative financial instruments (compilations of bank guarantees, returnable deposits and intelligent loans), thanks to which it would be easier for creators or small and medium-sized businesses from the creative sector to start their enterprises.
For its part, the Commission should ensure adequate levels of funding. I should also note that, of the 15 actions included in the Commission's action plan, nine should have an immediate application.
For its part, the EMCDDA will treat the Republic of Croatia as an existing Member State, through equal treatment in terms of linkage to the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction (REITOX) and staffing provisions.
For its part, the European Parliament has been consulted.
For many people, they mark the beginning of a European spirit, the first time they came into contact with colleagues and people their own age, really helping to strengthen the Union, and even more so given the new responsibilities for sport that the Union has assumed following the Treaty of Lisbon.
For many youngsters and professionals, programmes such as Comenius, Lifelong Learning, Youth in Action, etc. have represented the true coming-together of the European Union, inspiring truly European sentiments.
For me, and the majority of Lithuanians, it is therefore important for the new rules on the labelling of textile products mentioned in this report to help protect the reputation of our textile sector.
For me, education must be a political priority.
For me, the European Arrest Warrant symbolises the concept of a European state and citizenship of the European Union at the expense of the sovereignty of the Member States and at the expense of citizens' rights.
For me, the discussion about the various proposals in this report is about the choice of whether Europe is to be number one or number three.
For me, there is a whiff of superiority here, with Europe saying: 'We have got rid of child labour, but you Indians are still using it'. That is not the relationship we should have with a very important trading partner.
For millions of Europeans, programmes such as Erasmus, Lifelong Learning, Comenius, Leonardo, Youth in Action, and many others besides, are not just labels but a symbol of the European Union's existence.
For more than 10 years now, Parliament has been calling for tighter controls, including legislation on European inspections: for minimum criteria for inspections in Mr Jackson's report in 1999, for legislative reform for shipments of waste in Mr Blokland's report in 2003, and for minimum criteria for inspections in the 2008 resolution.
For my group, it was important to call for a coherent strategy that more effectively coordinates existing EU external policy programmes with cultural components, thereby taking account of cultural diversity in the EU. Mrs Pack has already made reference to this, saying that the existing structures in the Member States and between them, such as the EUNIC network of national institutes for culture, must be incorporated and that civil society must be seen as part of European external cultural policy.
For my part, I am in agreement with proceeding with the debate, but I should like to avoid arguments.
For my part, I believe that we should not only introduce the concept of a legislative footprint as soon as possible, but also a legislative fingerprint, in other words we should go public on all lobbyists with whom we come in contact and what our business is with them. I would invite you to take a look at my website, where I have set up a lobby ticker that registers every lobbyist contact, irrespective of whether or not I am currently working on a legislative initiative.
For my part, I do not see this as political grandstanding but rather the search for ownership, to enable ownership by the people.
For my part, I had the honour of working on the future of European territorial cooperation - Objective 3 of cohesion policy - and I should like to thank the shadow rapporteur and the European Commission for their fruitful collaboration.
For my part, I think this has been a useful and important debate, which shows how united Parliament is and how ready it is to offer its support for consistent and effective external action by Europe.
For my political group here in Parliament, national sovereignty over decisions on economic policy is a fundamental principle.
For next year that means mobilising additionally almost EUR 500 million for the southern Mediterranean and generally for that neighbourhood, consuming the margin of Heading 4, but that is also at the expense of flexibility instruments up to EUR 150-153 million.
For our own part, we wish here to reaffirm the necessity of respecting the ability of the Malagasy people to choose and determine their own future.
For our part, too, we welcome the six-party agreement which Mr Bütikofer mentioned, and we are also grateful that several speakers acknowledged the Hungarian Presidency's endeavours and that the Hungarian Presidency is handling this issue truly as a priority.
For our part, we declare ourselves willing to discuss agricultural products and to open up our market, but with a few conditions attached: obviously, we must say 'no' to GMOs and do everything we can to protect geographical indications.
For our part, we will continue to advocate making full use of these funds and making them complement each other, in order to defend and promote production in each country, making use of their potential for combating unemployment and promoting jobs with rights, to create wealth and distribute it better, to advocate quality public services, to combat poverty, and to defend small-scale coastal fishing, family-run farms and small and medium-sized farmers.
For our part, we will continue to advocate making full use of these funds and making them complement each other, in order to defend and promote production in each country, to combat unemployment and promote jobs with rights, to create wealth and distribute it better, to advocate quality public services, to combat poverty, and to defend small-scale coastal fishing, family-run farms and small and medium-sized farmers.
For our small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and entrepreneurs, Innovation Union is working to create conditions on intellectual property rights (IPR), standard setting and access to finance that will be much more conducive to innovation.
For pity's sake, we urgently need to adopt a clear position on cloning to prevent cloned meat and the offspring of cloned animals being placed on the European market, which is what European consumers and European citizens want!
For reasons of European animal welfare policy alone, we should be taking measures against cloning, Mr Dalli, and we hope that you will draw up a regulation as quickly as possible.
For regions like the one where we are now, here in Strasbourg and in Alsace generally, living on a frontier no longer equates with being restricted by borders, and the benefits extend far beyond these border regions.
For several months, the whole of Europe has been looking at the situation in the countries of North Africa, watching events which are taking place in our immediate neighbourhood with unconcealed anxiety.
For some time, the Commission has already been carrying out impact assessments of legislation before submitting legislative proposals to the European Parliament and the Council, but the report states that these impact assessment procedures still need to be greatly improved.
For that matter, one measure which can be taken in the public sector in particular is to impose strict rules for people to retire who have reached retirement age so as to free up jobs for young people.
For that reason (and in the light of the allocation of competences laid down in Article 9(1) of the Framework Directive), I oppose the establishment of an overarching spectrum planning and management system at European level.
For that reason as well, I think we should find a balanced solution to the matter of interparliamentary cooperation.
For that reason, I find the blocking tactics of a number of Member States - including my home country of Germany - totally incomprehensible.
For that reason, although an agreement has to be asymmetrical, at the end of the day, the tariffs must be zero.
For that reason, barriers that are still in place need to be removed and procedures simplified, while existing programmes need to be expanded and promoted.
For that reason, it gives me great pleasure to hear Commissioner Reding say that Member States will be required to exercise a proportionality test and to take care not to issue arrest warrants for minor offences.
For that reason, the ALDE Group strongly supports the Commissioner's position and insists on maintaining the status quo.
For that reason, we are still demanding that Member States submit their national declarations of assurance.
For that reason, we have also supported the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, from the start in his view that the same standards must apply to all Member States, including when it comes to Schengen.
For that to happen, as pointed out by the text of this resolution, which I endorse, it is important that the question of simplification and clarification of the rules for awarding public contracts finds answers quickly.
For that we will do the prudent work and then come to our authorising environment, to the Council and to Parliament, for your approval of the approach we are proposing to fill gaps.
For the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) to be fully effective from a transport perspective, its range has to be the whole of the Union, and indeed beyond, to cover our closest neighbours.
For the Japanese, there would be gains in the automotive and ICT sectors.
For the above reasons, I voted for this report and I support a European Commission proposal on this matter, which should, in future, involve the European Parliament itself, as well as economic and civil-society stakeholders.
For the above reasons, and in order to be able to develop a clear and comprehensive set of indicators that are, at the same time, consistent, relevant and objectively measurable, I voted for the motion being discussed.
For the dominant credit rating agencies (CRAs) in particular, the payment model is a problem, while the regulatory system's key problem is over-reliance on external credit ratings.
For the duration of the procedure, the joint committees thus become responsible within the meaning of the Rules of Procedure.
For the first time we are going to have a responsibility, a say, and be part of the final decision-making process.
For the first time, the 'polluter pays' principle will be applied to road transport, and it will be possible to charge heavy goods vehicles for noise and air pollution when they use the EU's motorways.
For the first time, there is a new European supervisory framework with experience of the two previous tests, enabling the promotion of transparency, the promotion of reliability and, clearly, the promotion of effectiveness, which is the key aspect of these third tests.
For the forthcoming period, we will certainly consider whether the level of the current upper limit is justified and whether any adjustments are necessary in order to better design or secure the absorption capacity.
For the future programming period I think that a single strategic approach, supported by a set of common implementation regulations for the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund, will produce added value.
For the future, we need a detailed report in this regard in order to significantly increase the speed of the GSM first generation network.
For the immediate future, the EU and the Member States should focus their resources on finding the source of the contamination in order to end the outbreak and the deaths that it has caused, and to restore consumer confidence in the food chain, as without this, it is impossible to put an end to our farmers' desperation.
For the majority of countries, debt reduction is a crucial issue, given the negative effects that it has on economic incentives, and on the growth of the economy thanks to increased taxes and risk premiums.
For the majority of people, the origin of the products plays a very important role in their decisions about what they want to spend their money on. In the textile sector, there is a need for a great deal more information in this area so that consumers know where the jumpers, jackets and trousers, etc. that they are buying come from and which materials they are made of. As things currently stand, the labelling requirements are highly inadequate.
For the most part, therefore, the collection of the relevant data will not impose any additional burden on respondents, as the Member States concerned should be able to compile the data by using existing data sources.
For the official signing, I should like to welcome Minister Győri and Maroš Šefčovič, Vice-President of the European Commission, and our colleagues Diana Wallis, Vice-President of the European Parliament, who was in the negotiator's team, Vice-President Isabelle Durant, Vice-President Rainer Wieland and Carlo Casini, Chair of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also the rapporteur.
For the producers affected, this gave rise to dramatic losses of income that threatened their very survival.
For the reasons given above, and in order to further improve cooperation with non-EU countries, I have voted in favour.
For the reasons mentioned, I support the position of the rapporteur.
For the sake of fairness, cohesion policy must also tackle sub-regional development inequalities to restore meaning to the word 'cohesion', that is to say this solidarity which is the added value of the European Union.
For the sake of fairness, we should also provide appropriate support to regions that do not qualify for Objective 1 but are nonetheless faced with structural difficulties. I am therefore glad that the European Commission has proposed creating an intermediate category for regions where GDP per capita is between 75 and 90% of the EU average. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Hahn for this work.
For the sake of stability, the EU budget's system of resources needs to be rethought so as to replace current national contributions with European resources.
For the sake of sustainable development, it is vital to make the right decisions on matters of environmental policy, namely, those based on reliable data. I therefore support and welcome the proposal for a regulation of Parliament and of the Council on European environmental economic accounts, as I believe that this will contribute to policy evaluation, particularly by making data available concerning the environmental impact of economic activities.
For the same reasons, I believe that a multicultural, multilingual and practical education is essential for shaping the citizens of the future, especially if this is achieved by means of mobility schemes such as Youth on the Move.
For the time being, the Commission has no plans to amend the framework directive on occupational safety and health.
For the vast majority of European citizens, the right to move freely is the embodiment of the European project and one of the most tangible results of the European Union, and I am pleased to say that most Europeans use their right to the full - people make around 1.25 billion journeys as tourists within the European Union countries every year.
For their part, entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to offer new quality services, which will stimulate the development of the common European economy.
For there is one thing that must be clear to us, which is that for the 16th time in succession the European Court of Auditors has not given a positive statement.
For these reasons Parliament has today voted to grant budgetary discharge for 2009.
For these reasons, I am voting in favour of the report.
For these reasons, I voted against this report.
For these reasons, I voted in favour of this European Parliament resolution on equal access to public sector markets in the EU and in third countries, and on the revision of the public procurement legal framework, including concessions.
For these reasons, I voted in favour of this resolution.
For these reasons, amongst others, I have decided to vote in favour of this dossier.
For these reasons, and for the sake of a better road system in Europe, I voted in favour.
For these reasons, and in order that the cooperation between the EU and the Republic of Seychelles may be strengthened for development, responsible exploitation and responsible fishing, I hereby express my vote in favour.
For these reasons, as a matter of national interest and as a member of Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism, I voted against the document tabled in plenary.
For these reasons, on 2 February 2010 these three countries signed the Agreement on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Prespa Park Area, with the participation of the EU, which also requires the consent of the European Parliament.
For these reasons, the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left refuses to back this report.
For these reasons, the European Commission's efforts to go beyond GDP and create a series of data and indicators that will improve its ability to interpret phenomena and help to better define policies and financial allocations should be commended.
For these reasons, the three countries concerned signed the Agreement on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Prespa Park Area on 2 February 2010, with the participation of the EU. The purpose of the agreement is to establish cooperation so as to ensure the integrated protection of the ecosystem and the sustainable development of the Prespa Park area, including the drawing up of integrated river basin management plans, in accordance with international and EU standards.
For these reasons, we should make schools and businesses more aware of the need to create networks, improving young people's practical knowledge by means of apprenticeships.
For this reason I am voting in favour of the proposal to increase the funds earmarked for urban development. I also agree with the idea that new investments should not be made exclusively in the economy and in specific sectors; instead, I would argue for the necessary implementation of projects which are to a large extent aimed at social cohesion and integration of the parts.
For this reason I would ask you, Mr Oettinger, not to try to pull the wool over our eyes.
For this reason it is important that Parliament should propose to enhance the European Urban Agenda within the framework of EU policies, reinforcing the contribution of cohesion policy to urban development and encouraging greater involvement on the part of local political stakeholders.
For this reason we have requested the agency, with the cooperation of the Internal Audit Service, to conduct an audit and present us with the results by the end of June.
For this reason, I am grateful that our invitation was accepted on a working level and that Ukraine, Russia, Switzerland, Armenia, Croatia and Turkey agreed to take the next step of a joint European stress test, which will allow a safety investigation to be carried out beyond the borders of the European Union.
For this reason, I am very grateful to my fellow Members - Mr Schlyter, as well as Mr Zalewski, Mr Sturdy and Mr Rinaldi - because they have tried and succeeded in finding a broad consensus. I think it would be a good thing if the other groups would reconsider this issue and recognise that the compromise on the table is actually a very good solution that tries to cater to all needs.
For this reason, I have decided to abstain on this own-initiative report, pending the Commission's proposal for a regulation on this matter.
For this reason, I hope that tomorrow's vote will show that the compromise that has been sought is supported by Parliament.
For this reason, I think we should actually be pressing ahead with an EU-Japan free trade agreement. I recognise that there are concerns over the natural disasters that have befallen Japan, but I have spoken to many Japanese colleagues, friends and others who believe that, if we tread sensitively, an EU-Japan agreement would send a signal that Japan is back on its way and is on the road to recovery.
For this reason, I voted for a text that tries to integrate development in the European Union with new social indicators, seeks a clearly defined measurement system that goes beyond GDP, and complements it in the context of decision making.
For this reason, I voted in favour of Parliament's proposal, which adopts the Commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
For this reason, I voted in favour of Parliament's proposal, which takes over the Commission proposal as adapted to the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission.
For this reason, I was keen to stress, through my vote, the need for the European Union to ensure that social standards and workers' rights are adhered to when signing agreements with these countries.
For this reason, I welcome the support the EU has pledged in order to help build this new state.
For this reason, Member States should ensure that vocational education and training is better adjusted to the needs of the labour market, and that vocational education provides employees with the skills needed to take up new, sustainable jobs that will be created in the future sustainable economy. I consider the role of local governments, entrepreneurial partnerships and educational institutions important in the development of the labour market demands of vocational education and training.
For this reason, a speech by a Member who belongs to the party which is in government in Spain is also not very helpful.
For this reason, all the studies say that investing in the first years of life produces much better results than doing it later. I believe that it is time, beyond focusing on university studies or on professional training, as we have been doing, for us to concentrate on early childhood learning.
For this reason, during the first stage, every operator of a nuclear power plant has been asked since 1 June to submit a report to the national authorities using the agreed European inspection criteria, our inspection catalogue, which is public and transparent.
For this reason, ensuring prudent fiscal policy-making is key. I am in favour of a strong European Economic Governance Package and have thus decided to vote in favour of the six dossiers as amended.
For this reason, it is crucial that cities be able to have their say, and that they receive due attention at EU level.
For this reason, it was particularly important to us that the requirements of the telecoms package for safeguarding media pluralism and cultural diversity were not thrown out by the back door.
For this reason, the Commission proposal includes important requirements concerning financing which aim to ensure that we do not impose an excessive burden on future generations.
For this reason, the Commission undertook in June 2010 to analyse the topics in depth. A public consultation was carried out, the Commission services have evaluated the responses and are working on an impact assessment with a view to issuing legislative proposals in the course of this year.
For this reason, the European Council decided last week to extend the measures imposed under the terms of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement by another six months.
For this reason, the European Parliament, as a codecision-making authority, as well as the public at large, must also be consulted.
For this reason, the Spanish socialists voted against a number of articles today: Article 9, in relation to the full harmonisation of information requirements for distance contracts; Article 17(2), the possibility of the consumer being liable for normal use of the goods during the withdrawal period; and Article 22(2), the introduction of an additional deadline for delivery of the goods when the trader fails to deliver the goods within the time period envisaged in the contract.
For this reason, the conditions are 20% for Europe alone and 30% if we have partners, in other words, the US or China. I believe that this is a serious, far-reaching and fair offer.
For this reason, the full implementation of the policy for small and medium-sized enterprises and, in particular, the Small Business Act, is a high priority task for the Hungarian Presidency.
For this reason, the partnership agreement provides for 'the possibility of applying a pro rata temporis payment' to compensate for losses suffered by the shipowners if they are forced to leave the Indian Ocean should they feel their safety to be severely threatened.
For this reason, the rapporteur recommends examining the idea of setting up a genuinely independent European credit rating agency, stating that the new European Credit Rating Foundation must be self-sustaining.
For this reason, the statements made by Prime Minister Netanyahu that the authorities in Ramallah should choose between Israel and Hamas are of no benefit either to peace or to the finding of a solution, or to the realisation of the project whereby the two states would live side by side in a spirit of mutual respect.
For this reason, this agreement is extremely important to Mauritania because the European Union is paying for this access, thereby providing additional income separate from financial aid.
For this reason, we can only assess European environmental policies and the related strategies adopted within the EU in a serious and rigorous way if reliable data are provided.
For this reason, we in the Commission are prepared to adopt every possible restrictive solution, including export bans and export restrictions.
For this reason, we should provide appropriate financial backing for cohesion policy. I would like to thank the rapporteur for including the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development in his report and I would ask for support for the amendment for once again improving the intermediate categories.
For this very reason, I welcome the initiatives demonstrated by the European institutions to guarantee the quality and reliability of impact studies, which will involve guaranteeing their independence and transparency.
For this very reason, although there is a long tradition of EU legislation on such contracts, it will never be going too far to call for better, more effective laws that guarantee the total transparency of procedures; that prevent all forms of corruption or manipulation of proposals to benefit one candidate; that put a ceiling in terms of numbers and of value on the number of awards without a call for proposals or without negotiation; and that guarantee proper competition on the Internal Market between candidate companies, irrespective of their country of origin.
For this very reason, we are very happy in the Union and want to help it become progressively stronger.
For those countries that repeatedly have problems managing money, payments should be suspended.
For too long we have operated under the 'gentleman's agreement' originating from 1970, according to which both Parliament and the Council have refrained from examining each other's administrative expenditure.
For too long, companies, especially in my region of the South East of England, have been targeted by this unscrupulous practice. I have been told by constituents that they have been invited to advertise their business for no costs only to receive a large invoice with legal threats not long after.
For transparency in EU agencies to be improved, all 21 Agencies and the Commission must publish a list of all contracts awarded over the last three years as well as a report of the staff members changing jobs from one agency to another, and they must enact stricter rules regarding conflicts of interest as soon as possible.
For us on the Committee on Culture and Education, it has been an idea and project that we have all shared, as 2014 will mark the hundredth anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War, which began with an incident in that very city.
For us, for Parliament, this is a vital part of the partnership. I see the modernisation pact as a complementary issue, in the same way that the common areas are.
For us, if the European Union is to progress, it needs to develop a policy based on principles of peace, detached from military means and interventions, and to promote the demilitarisation of international relations.
For us, it is not about making transport more expensive, as has just been claimed.
For us, this is about having a proper balance, so that those resources that are partly earned in relation to mobility are also invested in that area.
For years since I have been an MEP, I have been receiving letters and e-mails from constituents who have inadvertently been misled into signing up for a business directory, then being invoiced for a rather large amount of money.
For young people in particular, there were grave consequences of the global economic crisis, namely, serious rises in the youth unemployment and school drop-out rates.
Foreign operators pay nothing to use our roads but UK diesel duty is as much as 23 pence a litre higher, giving competitors a 15% advantage.
Foreign policy is one of them.
Forest-based industries, with a turnover of more than EUR 300 billion, provide more than 2 million, mostly rural, jobs, contributing to economic growth, jobs and prosperity through the provision of timber and opportunities for tourism. EU forests face major threats due to climate change, new pests, increasing risk of fire (particularly in the Mediterranean region), and human activity (growing energy sector demand for woody biomass), which is causing deforestation. I agree that the Commission and the Member States must intensify efforts to achieve the environment and quality-of-life goals of the Forest Action Plan, the implementation of which is currently lagging behind.
Forestry is a natural part of an integrated rural and regional policy, and this must be taken into account in the discussions on the future of the common agricultural policy after 2013.
Forests and wooded land cover 42% of the European Union's surface.
Forests and wooded land currently cover more than 42% of the EU's area and constitute an important source of revenue, generating more than EUR 300 billion a year and providing more than 2 million jobs.
Forests and wooded land currently cover more than 42% of the EU's surface and are an industry which provides approximately 2 million jobs, with an annual turnover of EUR 300 billion.
Forests are a part of our identity.
Forests are also an important provider of public services which go unrewarded by the market.
Forests are the main repository of carbon and have a vital role to play in the fight against climate change.
Forests provide 2 million jobs, many in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and represent an annual turnover of EUR 300 billion.
Forests provide us with many essential eco-services, ranging from regulating the water cycle to preventing soil erosion and sequestering carbon.
Forgoing origin marking is, sadly, only the latest terrible idea.
Formerly, internal border checks were obviously carried out, but the reason for these at the time was the holding of certain events, like sporting events, the European Football Championship, world championships, or certain summit conferences.
Fortunately, Amendment 64, which was approved, underlines that these transitional measures must not in any case be established at the expense of the current convergence, competitiveness and cooperation (Objectives 1, 2 and 3) regions.
Fortunately, however, by working on the proposal here in the European Parliament, we succeeded in incorporating elements that make this legislation beneficial for consumers, too. I believe that this is absolutely crucial.
Fortunately, last year in this House, the Løkkegaard report on journalism and new media, approved in September, supported the introduction of this subject in paragraph 13. I myself submitted an amendment in this regard.
Fortunately, the rapporteur took some major steps in our direction and we should certainly also thank the Council and the Hungarian Presidency, who succeeded, ultimately, not only in achieving a solid majority in the Council, but also in getting Parliament to support this position, too.
Forty-two per cent of the people working in agriculture are women, but only one holding in five is managed by a woman.
Four main objectives have been identified and correspond to four specific programmes that must structure the European research effort: the Cooperation Programme, the Ideas Programme, the People Programme and the Capacity Programme.
Four proposals relate to fiscal matters, including a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, while the two new regulations try to identify and resolve macroeconomic imbalances emerging within the EU and the euro area.
Four things are needed in order to prevent the Greek crisis from having a much-feared domino effect across the entire euro area: firstly, a united Greece with an economic and budgetary recovery plan; secondly, a European Union and a Euro Group which are united by the same objective; thirdly, a little more time than initially planned, particularly for privatisations; and fourthly, solidarity which is properly understood and which comprises not only new loans, but also, and above all, technical assistance from its partners, and in particular from the Commission.
Four years have passed since the introduction of the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development.
Fourthly and finally, let us not forget the farmers who have been treated badly: they have been wrongly suspected without having done anything! And there will be many more of them yet who suffer from the lack of trust among consumers.
Fourthly, Mrs Bowles and other speakers asked us about the differences in coverage of the banking sector within the Union.
Fourthly, in addition to all the cultural, social, religious and foreign policy concerns, the accession of Turkey would place a massive burden on the Cohesion Fund.
Fourthly, on transparency: we need to ensure greater transparency, in the interests of both freedom and security. I regret that, once again, the Council has not acted as it should in relation to Parliament, denying Members of this House access to the evaluation reports.
Fourthly, the coverage of other important Union policies beyond electronic communications: here, I am talking about the environment, transport or research and the need to make a substantial amount of spectrum available.
Fourthly, there is a need to also contribute to development in North Sudan, which we must not forget, and which is preparing to draw up a new constitution.
Fourthly, we cannot accept a deal that does not address the different standards and preferences from local SMEs and state monopolies in Canada.
Fourthly, we must monitor the training of nuclear engineers and speed up scientific research programmes, and on that note I would like to express my satisfaction that the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) has been extended into 2012 and 2013.
Fourthly: what budget is required by the United States of Europe?
France felt under pressure and it re-erected national borders.
France is an independent and sovereign country.
Free movement is also a great boost and a benefit for the Internal Market, so safeguarding this achievement is key to the Commission and an absolute priority for me personally.
Free trade is one of the pillars of neoliberalism which emerged in the 1970s under the so-called Washington Consensus, as one of the key elements of the capitalist system's response to the structural crisis that was making itself known at that time, just like today.
Freedom of expression for this Parliament's elected representatives should not be a movable goalpost and should not depend on whether or not a person's face fits.
Freedom of movement for European citizens unimpeded by internal borders following the creation of the Schengen area is one of the basic principles of the EU and the cornerstone of European integration.
Freedom of movement is one of the most important European Union values for all EU citizens and the Schengen area is characterised by the absence of controls at shared borders between participating countries and the introduction of freedom of movement within this area.
Freedom, the free movement of people and goods, and solidarity with everyone who is in need of solidarity, must remain priorities of the EU. I am opposed to internal borders, and I therefore expect a strengthening of the Schengen control mechanisms, so as to prevent the populist tendencies of some states, to prevent radicalisation and intolerance, and to consolidate the Schengen system, which is one of the greatest achievements of today's Europe.
Freight transportation and hard working lorry drivers have become synonymous with our country.
Frequency allocation comes under national jurisdiction but the regulations governing the sharing of the spectrum between users and operators is under the control of the European Union.
From 2020, it proposes five-year periods (or five-plus-five-year periods) which are more in tune with the mandate of the institutions.
From Korea to Australia, Bulgaria to Sweden, film makers head to Sarajevo; co-productions take place.
From a foreign policy perspective, I think that our good neighbourhood policy must be linked to the relevant governments fulfilling readmission commitments to their citizens.
From a systemic point of view, the Systemic Risk Board itself believes that this is important, and I believe that if the quality of the work done by the EBA, with your support and under the supervision of the Systemic Risk Board, means that we can happily shelve those absolutely ridiculous safeguard clauses that the Member States sought to include in the supervision package, then we will have taken a step forward. I therefore hope that the Commission and the Board will be very keen to ensure that concrete measures are taken by the Member States, large or small.
From an Irish perspective, the FP7 is helping to develop research that is, in turn, creating jobs and delivering new goods and services for our people. EUR 270 million has already been drawn down by Irish organisations in the agriculture, food, fisheries, health, energy, transport and ICT sectors.
From an Irish perspective, this FP7 programme is helping to develop research, research that is creating jobs and making goods and services available that are necessary and in demand.
From its beginnings until now, the CAP has undergone a number of reforms that testify to its support for agriculture that is constantly evolving in order to better respond to the numerous challenges that we have had to face. I welcome this vote, which is an achievement for the European Parliament.
From last year's bank stress test exercise, we know that the Greek banks hold EUR 48 billion of government securities, Greek Government bonds.
From now on, European citizens, as both the engines and the beneficiaries of innovation, must be able to participate fully in this 'Innovation Union' in order to ensure that it is successful, as we emphasised in this report.
From now on, consumers will have to be properly informed when they purchase digital content online and will have a right of withdrawal under certain conditions.
From now on, the members of the national parliaments will be governed by guidelines from the European Union on their countries' budgets.
From our point of view, an urban agenda should prioritise better distribution of the population in the territory of certain countries, particularly in Portugal, relieving the cities by valuing rural areas and properly remunerated farming; spreading productive activity across the country; valuing quality public services in rural and urban areas; combating unemployment; defending jobs with rights; valuing salaries and pensions; and combating poverty.
From that time, we have probably had the longest period of peace and prosperity globally. I have put a little bit of modest money away so that I can hand something down to my family when I pass on - largely because I have never spent more money than I have earned. I have been prudent and I have worked moderately hard.
From the Lithuanian border, it will be possible to see the chimneys of one of these power plants just as clearly as we can we the tower of Strasbourg Cathedral from Parliament.
From the first meeting in committee onwards, I have always emphasised that the stress test is voluntary.
From the outset of this textile report, I have been of the opinion that Parliament should keep to the scope of the proposal as it was originally designated and that the extension of this scope was not compatible with the aim of simplification for putting a new fibre on the market.
From the outset, parents are thus seen as incapable, irresponsible and childish.
From the perspective of providing protection in the event of a nuclear disaster, it is therefore very important to ensure that information is provided very quickly and efficiently, both to the public and to the experts, and that it is accurate.
From the perspective of the cost-benefit factor, this form of company could, in future, be more important than the European company. I am thinking in this respect of subsidiaries and transfers of registered offices throughout Europe.
From the point of view of climate change, ensuring the safety of forests is extremely important, as they are threatened more and more by natural disasters, especially such as fires or wide-ranging tree diseases.
From the point of view of the European Parliament, the most important issue should be the non-tariff barriers, which has been emphasised many times at meetings of the Trade Policy Committee.
From the realisation that the Stability Fund facilities had to be larger, to recognising the fact that punitive interest rates do not give sustainability and the chance to return to the markets, this House has not been afraid to lead and the Council has followed.
From this House, we must insist that those responsible for public procurement within the various administrative bodies incorporate terms into their tender specifications that facilitate positive discrimination in favour of SMEs and remove contractual provisions that hinder their participation.
From this perspective, it is important to pursue the objectives set out in the forestry strategies.
From this point of view, the Commission must ensure the compatibility and interoperability of Galileo with other satellite navigation systems.
From this report, I would also stress the respect for the preservation/promotion of linguistic/cultural richness in every Member State; the importance of disseminating European cultural values as a means of promoting fundamental rights, democracy and good governance; and, finally, the importance of there being a cultural 'attaché' in each of the EU's representations abroad.
From this stems my support for a report that is necessary in order to evaluate advances made in the common security and defence policy following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and to identify what scope there is for improvement.
From what is happening today in Syria, it is very clear that there is only one way to describe Bashar al-Assad, and that is as the most brutal dictator in the world at the moment.
Frontex is also supporting the Italian authorities in second-line border control activities by the briefing and screening of migrants.
Frontex, for example, should send back ships carrying bogus refugees to their countries of origin instead of playing the role of a sort of benevolent welcome committee.
Fuel prices have trebled, which has naturally raised the question whether EU legislation is adequate and suitable for the economic reality and meets European fishermen's needs.
Fukushima will now have a positive effect on the Japanese gross domestic product because a lot of investments are being made in this regard.
Full application in these Member States is also a question of equality and non-discrimination within Europe because excluding those two countries would send an extremely negative signal to their populations, which are very keen to join the area of freedom of movement.
Fundamentally, however, Portugal is capable of participating in the European project; of participating and of helping to resolve whatever challenges there will be in the future.
Funding cancer research can save people's lives and cut treatment costs. I applaud the political will in support of funding that has already been earmarked for cancer research under the programme.
Funding for programmes such as Lifelong Learning (Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Comenius, Grundtvig), Marie Curie, Erasmus Mundus and Youth in Action must increase.
Funding of projects where irregularities have occurred or funding to regions where citizens' rights are being disregarded should simply be stopped.
Funds must be used and I believe that we need to overcome the biggest enemy stalling projects of this kind or making them grind to a halt: excessive European red tape.
Further discussions relating to the previous procedure and implementation and its future administration, use and funding are required in this context.
Further expansion in this respect is therefore unavoidable, as proven by the plans to construct further plants in Poland, Lithuania and Slovakia, and I therefore support the introduction of stress tests and safety assessments for nuclear power stations.
Further expenditure is expected in a few years' time, in addition to that initially planned by the programme, and I believe it is likely that additional sums will be needed to complete the project. I therefore abstained from the final vote on the own-initiative report.
Further negotiations with the Council are needed so we can get a final agreement before summer in order to have a strong foundation for the euro.
Further steps and measures will still need to be taken before this crisis is overcome. I believe that what has been said here is right.
Further there will be a prohibition of so called pre-ticked boxes causing problems especially in the passenger travel sector.
Further to this idea, I find countless concerns in the report that deserve to be worked on and studied. I consider placing the MFF at the service of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, and the concern for at least maintaining the common agricultural policy (CAP) budget and keeping the two-pillar system, to be positive.
Further to this, the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) should award grants to fishers, in particular, in order to make fishing techniques more selective and to replace engines, for reasons of safety, of environmental protection and/or of fuel efficiency.
Further to this, the proposal to create a European and Community Patents Court is 'incompatible with European Union law' according to the Court of Justice of the European Union.
Furthermore I wish to emphasise here what is, in my view, the most important aspect of the agreement reached with the Council, namely, the commitment by the European Commission to present, by 30 September 2013, after it has carried out a suitable impact assessment, a report accompanied by legislative proposals regarding indication of origin labelling, traceability and the use of new technologies.
Furthermore, EGNOS is used on a daily basis by 80 000 European farmers and has recently been certified for civil aviation, and should shortly be certified for maritime transport.
Furthermore, European companies, too, should be required to be more open with respect to their accounts and subcontracting chains, so that the European Union's strong socio-political values do not remain merely illusory.
Furthermore, I believe in the principle that the polluter pays, and I also voted in favour of the amendment calling for an assessment of the costs, monitoring, the sending of regular reports to the European Commission and the participation of national governments.
Furthermore, I share the anger of some of my fellow Members regarding the Syrian exception and now the exception for Bashar al-Assad, who has avoided sanctions.
Furthermore, I should not like to forget the events of the last few weeks in the fruit and vegetable sector, which are proof that the new CAP must also provide crisis-response instruments for all the sectors concerned, instruments that are efficient, expeditious and adapted to the needs of each individual sector.
Furthermore, I support the Court of Auditors' comments regarding the need for improvements in the programming and monitoring of activities with a view to using the available appropriations as efficiently as possible.
Furthermore, I support the creation of a European Private Company Statute, which would help our SMEs to take full advantage of the single European market by enabling them to carry on their cross-border activities without having to fulfil often onerous and discouraging obligations. I therefore call on the Council to take a swift decision on this initiative.
Furthermore, I think that it is of paramount importance that this consolidation of economic governance takes place, while also boosting its democratic credentials.
Furthermore, I would like to highlight the close link between socio-economic disadvantage and opportunities to educate and teach children from an early age, because families on low incomes are much less likely to use ECEC services.
Furthermore, I would urge that workers involved in the management of radioactive waste, from its production to its disposal, receive adequate protection and training.
Furthermore, India is the largest beneficiary in the generalised system of preferences (GSP), and European Union imports from India by means of preferential tariffs or a zero rate of duty were valued at EUR 19.9 billion and constituted 83% of all EU imports from India.
Furthermore, Parliament intends to improve the Commission proposals in order to establish a robust and coherent legislative framework guaranteeing economic growth and employment for the next decades.
Furthermore, a knowledge-based economy will help to protect European cultural diversity and to carry us towards social cohesion and employment.
Furthermore, a set of measures is required to support SMEs in implementing the new energy efficiency plan.
Furthermore, additional support is required for transnational and cross-border cooperation, which is needed from the point of view of development and European convergence, and for the accomplishment of joint regional projects in the area of infrastructure and the environment.
Furthermore, adopting a systematic and synergic approach between the various European regional funds will contribute to the adoption of cohesion policy objectives and hence the reduction of disparities in development between European regions, and will facilitate social inclusion.
Furthermore, agriculture needs support in order to innovate and focus effort on a more efficient use of energy, water and soil.
Furthermore, and I quote: 'Illegal immigration from Turkey will spread to the coasts of Bulgaria and the trafficking of drugs and humans by Turkish and Albanian criminal gangs will increase'. Moreover, regarding human trafficking, 'Romania and Bulgaria's entry into the Schengen area could give Bulgarian criminal groups and Roma communities new opportunities to increase their already significant trafficking to the rest of Europe'. In the final analysis, increased illegal immigration from Turkey and more drug and human trafficking mean less security for European citizens.
Furthermore, as a result of the brutal austerity, in many countries, it is virtually impossible for young people to get a decent job after finishing education. A quarter of young people in Ireland are now unemployed and 1 000 people emigrate every week, so for many Irish families, the very notion of Youth on the Move has a very different meaning.
Furthermore, attention is drawn to the recent nuclear disaster, which is still not fully under control.
Furthermore, better use of resources, sustainable economic development and nature conservation can and must go hand-in-hand, and should likewise reinforce cooperation with neighbouring countries for their integration into Europe.
Furthermore, clear reference criteria need to be introduced regarding Russia's respect for democratic standards, which will help deepen relations with the EU. Lastly, we must not forget either the support which needs to be given in developing civil society, as the guarantor of a democracy which will not only stick to procedures but be truly inclusive as well.
Furthermore, collaboration between the public and private sectors, through the implementation of partnerships, is an important way of encouraging a more innovative economy.
Furthermore, crops which grow in the vicinity of heavily used roads would be much less exposed to pollution from exhaust fumes. I think the increased charges for driving at peak hours are another positive feature.
Furthermore, due to the constant technological changes, employers have ever-increasing expectations with regard to employees' qualifications.
Furthermore, entrepreneurs, managers of small and medium-sized enterprises in the creative sector, need better access to financing opportunities, because we currently have too little know-how and too little access to bank finance.
Furthermore, false declarations are often used to export waste as second-hand goods, which complicates the work of the authorities responsible for monitoring and enforcing the rules.
Furthermore, forest-based industries provide more than 2 million jobs, contributing to economic growth and employment. I voted for this report as I think that the European Union must strengthen its strategy for improving the sustainable management and conservation of forests.
Furthermore, great strides have been made in the fight against corruption, a topic which often has been associated wrongfully and, to an exaggerated extent, with accession to the Schengen area.
Furthermore, high standards in terms of air safety and security will be applied and these are vitally important to passengers, crew and the whole aviation sector in general.
Furthermore, if the free trade agreement is to reflect each party's level of development, it cannot overlook such fundamental standards as the prohibition of child labour, for example.
Furthermore, if you think, Mr Farage and Mrs Swinburne, that you are going to defend the so-called sovereignty of the United Kingdom - and that applies to all the Member States, be they small States like my own, or large States such as Germany, France and the United Kingdom - if you think that, alone, you will still be able to exert some influence in the world, then I think you are sadly mistaken.
Furthermore, illegal shipments of waste to third countries obviously have an adverse effect on trade and competition since, economically speaking, businesses that comply with the legislation evidently face competition and are put at a disadvantage.
Furthermore, in many of the documents it has adopted recently, setting out its development goals and guidelines for the next decade, the European Union stresses the importance of research and innovation for strengthening the EU economy and helping it remain one of the most competitive in the world.
Furthermore, in order to avoid scenarios whereby funds remain unused because of excessively complicated regulations and procedures, it is essential that management and implementation of cohesion policy be simplified.
Furthermore, in order to enable people at different times of life and specific groups to have access to vocational education and training, financing opportunities should be broadened, simplified and made more readily available under the Lifelong Learning Programme and by implementing Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs.
Furthermore, in the event of commercial disputes, the reciprocity principle should be applied, the protection of intellectual property rights should be improved and there should be reciprocal access to the services and public procurement markets.
Furthermore, increasing mobility at European Union level through expanding programmes such as Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci or Youth on the Move can also help improve the EU's ability to respond better to the demand of the European labour market and to have greater potential for development in this area.
Furthermore, it can be misleading in the sense that remedial measures following certain incidents such as accidents and natural disasters are treated as a benefit instead of a cost.
Furthermore, it can be misleading in the sense that remedial measures following certain incidents such as accidents and natural disasters are treated as a benefit instead of a cost. I therefore welcome the provision set out in the resolution that we need to develop additional indicators for measuring medium and long-term economic and social progress, and to establish clear and measurable indicators that provide information on climate change, biodiversity, resource efficiency and social inclusion.
Furthermore, it institutionalises the European Semester through the need for the involvement of all the European institutions, where national reform programmes should incorporate EU objectives. I should also like to stress that it seeks to expand the mechanism of reversed qualified majority voting in the Council to all stages of the process of assessing, examining and monitoring the Stability and Growth Pact and national convergence programmes. I am voting for this report because I believe the EU needs to send a message of stability to the markets, using a short- and long-term economic governance strategy.
Furthermore, it is a pro-investment policy and a pro-development policy.
Furthermore, it is advisable to ensure that procedural rights are actually respected: that is, that individuals wanted under the auspices of an EAW have a genuine right to legal aid at their disposal, both in the Member State that issues the warrant and in the Member State where it is implemented.
Furthermore, it is also proving to be effective because it has given the Republic of Seychelles the necessary instruments to develop responsible fishing, increasing its stock management and fisheries monitoring capacity. I therefore believe it is right to proceed on the road of partnership agreements in this sector which is vital to the European economy.
Furthermore, it is important that citizens have confidence in the principles governing the safety of repositories and in waste management programmes.
Furthermore, it is not stating the obvious to say that payments based on the two pillars of the CAP are not mere public resources, but actually buy a public good that may not be sufficiently rewarded by the market.
Furthermore, it is probably a very realistic approach, considering the capacity that the Member States have, to start a system of accounts in these areas.
Furthermore, it is very important for the governments themselves not to retreat from their responsibility to maintain the European social model because then, there is the threat of the privatisation of employment law and social security systems and services.
Furthermore, it is very important to create a favourable business environment for companies that cooperate in developing and implementing vocational training programmes.
Furthermore, it leaves States just one right, that of 'regulating' public services, an action that a liberalisation of this nature nonetheless condemns.
Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that negotiations with third countries and with the World Trade Organisation pose a serious threat to the future of agricultural and livestock production in the European Union.
Furthermore, it touches on important issues, such as strengthening the role of the International Criminal Court and the international criminal justice system, promoting accountability, putting an end to impunity, and strengthening the crisis-prevention structures and their effectiveness within the United Nations Development Programme, with a view to transforming this organisation into a global leader in crisis prevention and recovery.
Furthermore, it would reflect the ability of the European institutions to cooperate responsibly and without delay when Europe is in huge need of this.
Furthermore, more work needs to be done to ensure the compliance of environmental standards in Canada with those in force in the EU. In connection with the above, I believe that it is necessary to carry out a detailed analysis and evaluation of the abovementioned standards.
Furthermore, new competences, like those relating to the area of freedom, security and justice, require the reinforcement of its resources and capacity for action.
Furthermore, owing to the European Union's high degree of dependency on imports from third countries (60%), producers have very little or even no influence on the price levels of fisheries products. I agree that the ceiling on de minimis aid should be raised from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per firm for a transitional period of three years, while ensuring that environmental and social sustainability are not undermined and that competition between Member States is not distorted.
Furthermore, satellite navigation systems must provide interoperability with different systems, including traditional systems.
Furthermore, that is true in both rural and urban areas.
Furthermore, the Agreement constitutes a net benefit for the EU given that it will establish mutual acceptance of certification findings in all areas of airworthiness for all Member States.
Furthermore, the Commission recognises the progress made during conciliation.
Furthermore, the Commission's proposed measures would be very much in the spirit of Schengen, since controls would be reinstated as a last resort and the decision would be taken at European level rather than at intergovernmental level.
Furthermore, the EU's diverse cultural landscape gives us the distinction of being the most attractive tourist destination in the world. I welcome the concrete suggestions presented in this report for the involvement of civil society, artists, educators, students and entrepreneurs in shaping the content of external cultural relations.
Furthermore, the German authorities, in view of their reckless accusations, should definitely support this financial solution from the very beginning, and use funds of their own to conduct communication campaigns aimed at restoring consumer confidence in horticultural products, which is now in shatters.
Furthermore, the Greens feared that the measures might pave the way for the inclusion of Pakistan in the GSP+ scheme without the country having signed and implemented the corresponding labour and environmental conventions (let alone the Geneva Conventions). Finally, the Greens wished to exclude ethanol from the list of duty-free products, as it would be made out of sugar cane, which would replace food crops, constitutes a GHG-intensive crop and does not create a significant number of jobs.
Furthermore, the Member States will be able to specify the use to be made of revenue generated from tolls collected, but at least 15% will have to be used for financial support for TEN-T projects, in order to increase transport sustainability.
Furthermore, the adoption of innovative solutions is closely bound up with pre-commercial procurement, which resolves issues which the market cannot cover or where the solutions proposed are uneconomic.
Furthermore, the agreement reached with the European Parliament also provides incentives in respect of the least polluting vehicles in the Euro 5 and 6 categories, in order to promote the renewal of the vehicle fleet.
Furthermore, the binding state-to-state dispute settlement mechanism only serves to empower foreign investors to initiate legal proceedings at an international level against the governments of the EU and India, while domestic investors only have recourse to national courts.
Furthermore, the common agricultural policy (CAP), which is essential for the food security and independence of our continent, and EU regional policy, strengthened by creating an intermediate category of regions to enable additional financial support to be channelled to those regions where per capita GDP is between 75% and 90% of the European average, such as Auvergne and Limousin, find within it all the space that they deserve.
Furthermore, the constitution invests the Budget Council, a body that is not elected directly, with the power of veto over the decisions of Parliament concerning the budget, which, in turn, may result in the dissolution of Parliament and a call for new elections, thereby threatening stable governance.
Furthermore, the data could be monitored more easily if high quality information were available regarding the interaction between environmental and economic factors: environmental economic accounts could contribute to policy evaluation by making available data concerning the environmental impact of economic activities.
Furthermore, the document we approved today also encourages the introduction of origin marking, which would facilitate consumer choice and contribute to reducing fraudulent or misleading claims of origin.
Furthermore, the establishment of European alliances for territorial cooperation is to be made easier, because this new instrument will make it easier for local administrations and citizens to access greater cooperation, benefiting many regions, in particular border regions.
Furthermore, the greatest challenges in terms of the efficient management of infrastructure and transport are also found in urban areas, and these have a direct impact on environmental and energy policy.
Furthermore, the idea of joint and sustainable European policies has lost out on more than one occasion to the interests of the largest countries of the 'old' EU. A perfect example of this is the lack of a rule ensuring geographical balance when filling posts in the European External Action Service.
Furthermore, the instrument would not replace Member States' contract laws, but would merely help ensure a better choice of contract model between the parties, thanks to examples based on general principles, definitions and model regulations for both commercial and consumer contracts, without going against the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.
Furthermore, the introduction of a trilingual system does not seem to conform to administrative requirements and does not even seem to reflect the demographic weighting of the Member States, because in that case, Italy should also be represented.
Furthermore, the newly-created European Asylum Support Office, although still in the process of becoming fully operational, is also available to help.
Furthermore, the nuclear stress tests, as your colleague Mr Oettinger acknowledged this afternoon, are also a big joke - they have been so far anyway - since the possibility of an aeroplane crashing into a power station has not been taken into account. I would therefore like to say that, in a case such as that, where an aeroplane crashes into a nuclear power station, there is clearly a default risk.
Furthermore, the problems detected during the work of the committee are not connected to the year following the year for which discharge is granted.
Furthermore, the proposal also sets out the conditions under which Member States will be able to negotiate and conclude new bilateral investment agreements with third countries, regarded as an exceptional transitional measure.
Furthermore, the report proposes a three-year period in which to bring down the total debt, which I consider reasonable and sufficient.
Furthermore, the report recommends a set of criteria for assessing the content of the agreements, including balanced access to markets and investment opportunities, and fair competition with regard to state, environmental and social subsidies. I voted in favour so that a constant flow of information is maintained and the strengths and weaknesses of these agreements are analysed better.
Furthermore, the said concessions have no conditionality clause attached, as would apply if Pakistan were granted GSP+ status.
Furthermore, the statement of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on Yulia Tymoshenko was exceptionally cautious.
Furthermore, the way in which this approach penalises the geographically more peripheral Member States, countries of origin, departure or destination of goods, for the benefit of 'central' and transit countries, is unacceptable.
Furthermore, there is a lack of adequate progress on government procurement and services, principles for the protection of intellectual property, including geographical indications, conditions for sustainable development, and particularly in following production standards when creating equal conditions for competition. I believe that it is essential to carry out an assessment of the specific character of individual sectors to flag possible negative influences of a free trade agreement on vulnerable sectors of the economy of the European Union.
Furthermore, there is the call for the Commission to make a proposal on euro securities. I would like to publicly support this as a proposal that takes into account the feature of fiscal discipline.
Furthermore, they have to establish a system which determines the competence and responsibility of national authorities in respect of nuclear waste management.
Furthermore, this ban would have come into effect immediately after the regulation entered into force.
Furthermore, this report should have elaborated on opening up deprived neighbourhoods, the role of medium-sized towns in the urban agenda, as well as the battle for climate and social mixing in our towns.
Furthermore, this resolution refers to the potential death penalty being imposed on some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world, who thought nothing of conspiring to murder thousands of innocent people.
Furthermore, this surveillance should be broadened to prevent harmful macroeconomic imbalances, with a guarantee that, in future, it will go beyond fiscal policy and that its remit will be extended to early detection and prevention of potentially harmful economic imbalances, too.
Furthermore, to reduce them now would have serious consequences for the future of all the Member States.
Furthermore, we also have a major problem in the fight against abuse and discrimination against immigrants, many of whom work in European families.
Furthermore, we are not satisfied because we believe that stress tests, which, in fact, are going to be carried out by the operators themselves, should be subjected to a second opinion in order to ensure greater objectivity.
Furthermore, we cannot forget the environmental consequences of this waste, which is harmful to biodiversity. I therefore voted for this proposal, which aims to implement the polluter-pays principle - respect for which has been very gradual - and introduces measures restricting the shipping of these goods to third countries.
Furthermore, we have been stressing the importance of promoting investment in public services, of supporting production, of creating jobs with rights, of eradicating poverty, and of combating social inequality.
Furthermore, we need reliable chemical tests to confirm that textiles created meet hygiene and environmental criteria.
Furthermore, we need to make the new register operational as quickly as possible and, as soon as the register is operational, all persons and organisations falling into its scope should provide correct, up-to-date information so we can see who is influencing what.
Furthermore, we want to support the development of government systems, democracy, human rights and also economic and institutional reforms, and to prevent conflicts and weakening of the state.
Furthermore, we would now say that if the CFCA is allocated a budget of EUR 10 100 000 (financial year 2009), the Member States are already being denied the possibility that the EU contribution to financing control activities could increase, in line with the proposal we tabled recently in Parliament, which was, unfortunately, rejected by the majority.
Furthermore, with the aim of helping SMEs expand their cross-border activities, the process of recovering cross-border debts will need to be facilitated and the European Private Company Statute adopted without delay.
Fusion is designed to provide the world's population with energy that is clean, permanent and safe.
Future cohesion policy must have an appropriate budget, so that it can effectively meet the new challenges, support all the regions of the European Union, with particular emphasis as always on the regions with the most development problems, include thematic objectives and, at the same time, a degree of flexibility, rely on simplified rules which have been unified to the maximum possible extent between its funds and ensure that all citizens of the Union will be able to enjoy its benefits, even if they are living in the most remote parts of the European Union, on islands and in mountain areas.
Future cohesion policy, the pillar of solidarity of the European project and of social justice, must take into account the following priorities: firstly, reinforcing social cohesion and incorporating the challenges posed by the Europe 2020 Strategy; secondly, providing for the needs and geographical characteristics of the regions, especially the most disadvantaged regions; thirdly, maintaining a gradual approach to the collection of funds so that the regions do not abandon the objective of convergence, avoiding sudden changes in the receipt of aid; and fourthly promoting an equitable system.
Future spectrum policy must also guarantee a suitable, simple and non-discriminatory authorisation system, which would create a level playing field throughout the EU and would promote competition.
GDP (gross domestic product) is the aggregated added value of all money-based economic activities.
GDP is an indicator of market economic activity that has become the standard point of reference at the service of the world's decision makers. GDP is a measure of production that does not measure environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion and social progress in general. I therefore agree that in the future, other types of instruments should be studied that allow for a greater number of reliable data for measuring a world that is changing.
Galileo, Europe's own global navigation satellite system, is of great importance to Europe and, in particular, the UK. This project, which I fully support, has not only received significant public funding but private industry throughout the EU is also investing money, time and expertise into developing this system.
Galileo, together with EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service, an augmentation system that improves the accuracy and the reliability of the US Global Positioning System (GPS) information), is the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) developed by the EU. When completed, it is expected to consist of 27 satellites plus a suitable number of spare satellites in orbit at an altitude of approximately 23 000 km above the surface of the earth, and a worldwide network of approximately 40 ground stations.
Generally Croatia's anti-drug legislation is similar to that of the EU Member States.
Generally speaking, Mrs Hirsch's report is a good starting point for what must become one of the priority policies of Parliament and the entire European Union.
Generally, these reports fail to meet Conservative concerns regarding the EU's management of Cohesion policy in any meaningful way.
Georgia has de facto the right of veto.
Georgia has practically eliminated the cancer of corruption in state institutions and the civil service by means of a series of public sector reforms (concerning the public prosecutor's office, the judiciary and the police) and political reforms.
Georgia's economy has recovered after Russia's military invasion of 2008, and has done extremely well in comparison to other countries of a similar size in the difficult times of the global financial crisis.
Germany has already announced that it is going to halt operations at a number of power stations.
Germany's recent decision to phase out nuclear power by 2022 marks a new stage in the fundamental rethinking currently taking place in Europe concerning its energy independence and the possible alternatives to nuclear power.
Gesine Meissner and I, as Liberal Members of the European Parliament, are sponsoring an electric car in the race in order to promote sustainable transportation.
Getting back to what we need to do: we need to establish a reporting obligation throughout Europe, define central laboratories and set up a central body within the European Union with the decision-making power in the event of an outbreak of such a disease. I think that would be the appropriate thing to do.
Give Mr Potočnik the few weeks he needs to draft this legislation. I can say on his behalf that it will be before the end of this year, 2011, that the Commission, taking into consideration the very important debate that you have held, despite the late hour, presents its legislative proposals to step up the fight against these illegal shipments and all their consequences.
Given all these inexplicable factors and the fact that various countries - including Britain, the USA, Iraq and Israel - have, in the past, been reported as experimenting with genetically manipulated E coli as a biological weapon, should there not be an urgent inquiry into the possibility that this outbreak is, in fact, an instance of, and perhaps a test run for, biological terrorism?
Given his experience in this area, I believe I can safely endorse his evaluation, and his demands for external border security.
Given our position on the accession of these countries, we have maintained our position of abstention, reinforced by the pressure that continues to be exerted on these countries.
Given that Commissioner Dalli has committed himself on numerous occasions before this House to presenting this proposal, I trust that the Commission will send it to us as soon as possible.
Given that EU cohesion policy is part of a framework of solidarity encompassing the 27 Member States and their 271 regions, and that it aims to end the economic and social disparities that exist therein, it is crucial that the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) increase the funding allocated to this objective, as these are regions with serious competitiveness problems, but are essential to the EU's sustainability. I therefore agree with the rapporteur's proposal to strengthen the 'Territorial Cooperation' objective by increasing the overall budget from 2.5% to 7%, adopting measures to simplify the implementation of programmes and creating European Groupings of Territorial Cooperation (EGTCs), which are essential to the functioning of cross-border governance systems.
Given that I have already tabled a parliamentary question on this issue, I take the opportunity in this Chamber to stress the need for the Union to commit itself to supporting European producers in this sector with instruments appropriate to the seriousness of the crisis. I also draw the Commission's attention to the fact that it should consider introducing measures to improve the preservation of fruit and vegetables and increase controls on their packaging.
Given that Parliament is the only European institution that is democratically elected and that represents European citizens and taxpayers directly, I believe we have the right to know exactly how all the appropriations are managed.
Given that Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis in 2007; that the documents show both Bulgaria and Romania are ready for EU accession from a technical point of view; that all the accession headings were met in March 2011; and that the delay in the adoption of the new Schengen evaluation system to minimise existing problems - I fear that insecurity will increase - cannot prevent the entry of these countries into the EU, I am voting in favour.
Given that a role as important as the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund is at stake, I think that, compared to the energy that is at times put into recruiting third-level managers in companies, the way in which this process is being handled shows a lack of professionalism.
Given that a well-functioning legal regulation mechanism is already in force in this area in the European Union, I do not endorse this resolution on policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses, which proposes adopting a new regulation, which would set up a new optional instrument, to be applied in business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions.
Given that demographic changes are fuelling the need for training and adding to the necessity to participate in lifelong learning, workers must be provided with a means of determining and planning their own training needs.
Given that domestic work accounts for between 5% and 9% of all employment; that the vast majority of the people employed in that sector are women; that such work is undervalued, underpaid and informal; and that domestic workers' vulnerability means they are often discriminated against and can easily be subjected to unequal, unfair or abusive treatment, solutions must be found to eliminate this type of situation. I therefore welcome this International Labour Organisation convention, which warns of problems involving domestic work.
Given that it is actually the job of the Commission President to represent the Commission, we are anxious for Mr Barroso to be present at 15:00 on Tuesday afternoon. I apologise for having mixed up Tuesday and Wednesday.
Given that public procurement contracts account for 17% of the European Union's GDP, we think that SMEs need to increase their involvement in the public procurement market.
Given that relations between the EU and the Principality of Andorra are extended but fragmented, we recommend that an analysis of the possibilities and modalities of its possible progressive integration into the internal market be undertaken at the earliest opportunity.
Given that situation, I would say that the very best result has been achieved.
Given that the EU budget is potentially a major instrument for growth and given that it has not yet undergone substantial restructuring in response to the new developments resulting from the generalised economic and debt crisis:
Given that the EU countries and Japan face common challenges, I think it is important that we look at some of these issues and address them through trade agreements.
Given that the Internet is the main instrument for creating better conditions and development and knowledge for citizens in cultural terms, particularly through the broadcasting of audiovisual content, I welcome the adoption of this report and hope that the EU will play a leading role in the radio spectrum and in the creation of development and innovation software.
Given that the agreed text is acknowledged as better than the Council general approach, this does not make sense.
Given that the application fulfils the eligibility criteria, I agree with the rapporteur's recommendations and am voting in favour of this proposal for a decision.
Given that the interim agreements/stabilisation and association agreements (SAAs) grant trade concessions to Bosnia and Herzegovina on the products identified in the autonomous trade preferences, these concessions have to be withdrawn from Council Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009.
Given that the introduction of the Schengen area has shifted responsibility for EU external border controls onto a limited number of Member States, how will the Commission persuade Member States as a whole to show greater and more effective solidarity in the face of a mass influx of migrants and overcome their manifest reluctance to assume their responsibilities in this respect, so as to ensure that the burden is fairly shared?
Given that the main economic activities in Seychelles are fishing and tourism, and that this agreement benefits both the EU and the Republic of Seychelles, in view of the creation of 3 000 jobs in Seychelles and 760 in Europe and the monitoring of catches through a multiannual sectoral programme which provides for scientific cooperation and the promotion of responsible and sustainable fisheries, I am voting in favour of this proposal for a recommendation.
Given that the proposals tabled - following ten years of studies - will contribute to solving the detected failings, which are essentially to do with contracts, and that there is a need to promote the Internal Market by removing barriers, I am voting for this report, which introduces an optional instrument (OI) that could be complemented with 'a toolbox' aimed at resolving the problem of contracts.
Given that the purpose of this directive is the codification of previously disparate pieces of legislation, with benefits in terms of the accessibility and comprehensibility of the legislation, without any changes in their substance, I voted in favour of this report.
Given that the safeguarding of border security has always constituted a key aspect of the Lega Nord's political ideology, I can only express my approval of this measure.
Given that the workers in these sectors are mainly women who are generally responsible for their own family, both in terms of raising children and looking after elderly relatives, I would like to ask the Commission whether any statistics are available on domestic workers at EU level and the level of each Member State. I would also like to ask what measures the Commission is intending to take to ensure not only the necessary flexibility but also the respect for the rights of these workers.
Given that this protocol serves the interests of both parties and that it promotes responsible and sustainable fisheries, I am voting in favour of this proposal for a recommendation.
Given that you state that we currently need more resources for Frontex, I would be interested to hear whether you are not also of the opinion that the Member States have hitherto been too unwilling to provide the resources to make Frontex strong.
Given that, in the already extensive relations between the EU and the Principality of Andorra, this is another positive step towards possible integration into the internal market and that, as well as including rules to ensure that the agreement and the EU acquis remain in alignment, it aims to ensure customs security and normal relations between both parties, I welcome the adoption of this recommendation, for which I voted.
Given the 25% fall in its turnover compared with the pre-crisis period, this sector, an important and well-developed one in our regions, needs our support, not more constraints.
Given the added value of Commission aid, and the Commission's new role in coordinating the Union's and the Member States' development policy (Article 210 TFEU), the share of ODA channelled through the EU budget should remain at least stable.
Given the consequences that credit ratings for sovereign debt can have for the market, budgetary balances and the general welfare of the people, it is imperative that these be based on trustworthy facts and figures.
Given the critical role played by parents as 'main educators', the report seeks to improve parental leave - which should be long enough to enable parents to play their leading role in educating their children in the early stages of their life - and encourages the Member States to invest in parental education programmes as well as provide other forms of assistance to parents who require additional help.
Given the current crisis in the sector, we believe that it is important that the fees payable by owners should not be changed in relation to the previous agreement, but should remain at EUR 35, despite the fact that there has been a significant increase in catches per tonne: 25 tonnes for tuna seiners and 10 tonnes for long-liners.
Given the current globalisation, international labour standards are the basis which guarantees that the growth of the global economy will benefit all.
Given the economic and financial crisis that we are currently experiencing, it is necessary to extend these conditions to 31 December 2015 so that the cessation of these special conditions does not lead to stagnation in the economies of these regions, as good economic conditions are needed to maintain stability and peace in this troubled Balkan region.
Given the economic crises the EU is facing, it is essential we identify which areas of our activities lend themselves to helping us overcome our difficulties.
Given the fact that they murdered nine activists on the flotilla last year, these threats have to be taken extremely seriously.
Given the financial, technical, institutional and administrative efforts made by Romania to join the Schengen area, I think that the positive assessment of this dossier must be shown in the period ahead by setting a definite deadline for joining this area.
Given the high value of the global market in this sector, which will continue to grow over the coming years, I would also like to highlight the importance of creating the conditions for European industry to be competitive.
Given the huge importance of the livestock sector for the European agricultural economy, it is essential to address this issue properly. I agree that the Member States should perform regular systematic surveillance and monitoring of AMR in food producing animals, without creating additional financial or administrative burdens for farmers or other animal owners or veterinarians.
Given the importance of knowledge-based industries to Europe and our thriving R&D sector, we cannot afford to wait until FP8 to take action.
Given the importance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the appropriate financial resources must be put towards improving their operating conditions. I do not agree with the proposal to reduce the financing allocated to the common agricultural policy in the future because agriculture is a particularly sensitive sector.
Given the importance of such agreements, especially in terms of guaranteeing better services for passengers and new opportunities for operators, it is a good idea for Parliament to inform the Commission of its concerns and its assessment criteria at the outset, without waiting until the negotiations have been concluded.
Given the importance of the European telecommunications industry and information technologies for higher productivity and competitiveness in our market, I am voting for the radio spectrum policy programme. I believe in the ability of this programme to create the conditions necessary for successful competition with the new technology markets of China and the US, as well as maintaining European leadership in the telecommunications industry.
Given the increase in political and humanitarian crises in the world, the EU needs to make the best possible use of its foreign policy instruments so as to ensure better use of its leverage in multilateral organisations and its ability to take the lead in addressing current and future international crises.
Given the internal political situation in Georgia and issues of legality and transparency in that country, we have no assurances that it will be well spent.
Given the major internal challenges faced by the Union and its citizens and bearing in mind its enhanced international character, we realise that the main objective of its policy must be to reduce the existing social, economic and territorial inequalities. A planned and successful cohesion policy constitutes per se European added value and will surely prove to be to the benefit of all the Member States of the Union.
Given the nature of the Sri Lankan Government, it is obvious that it will not allow any international investigation.
Given the positions of the main protagonists in this process, we will all have to show some level of flexibility.
Given the profound injustice today existing between countries, producers and products, the advocated redistribution of CAP funds cannot be dissociated from the guarantee of minimising losses by the major beneficiaries...
Given the results of the referendum, the will of the people of South Sudan is now unequivocally in favour of independence, as has been repeatedly reiterated for many years now.
Given the scale of the threats and the total area of forests in the EU, the financing should increase, eligibility to receive assistance should be extended to public bodies and producer groups, and contributions should be paid on an area basis and should cover protective measures.
Given the scope of the threats and total EU forest area, common agricultural policy (CAP) financing through pillar 2 for forests should increase, subject to the existence of national forest programmes (NFPs) and operational management plans, which incorporate the EU biodiversity strategy and long timeframes for forestry projects in sustainable forest management (SFM). Eligibility should be extended to public actors and producer groups, shifting to area-based remuneration and including in situ and ex situ conservation measures.
Given the serious developments in parts of the Union's southern neighbourhood, the European Council is also expected to adopt a declaration on recent events in the region.
Given the significant impact of contract law on financial transactions and, therefore, on the Internal Market, I welcome all the efforts made by the Commission and the European Parliament towards harmonising their parameters within the EU and adapting them to the Single Market. I am voting for the report tabled on this issue.
Given the significant profits that both parties will be able to make, I hope that the negotiations between the EU and India will be able to continue, with a view to quickly establishing a free trade agreement (FTA) which is ambitious, balanced and comprehensive.
Given the size of India's market (more than 1 billion inhabitants) and its impressive growth rates (averaging over 7% a year since 2000), coupled with high levels of protection, India is one of the EU's obvious partners for concluding one of the new generation of EU FTAs launched as part of the Global Europe strategy in 2006.
Given the still fragile economic situation resulting from the financial crisis that has rocked Europe, in his mid-term review, the rapporteur mentions important aspects that should be improved so as to use the available public funding as efficiently as possible. I agree with the emphasis given by the rapporteur to two issues that are very important for future European research: increased simplification of payments between the European Commission and other entities, and increased participation by small and medium-sized enterprises, and industry in general, in responding to the great social challenges.
Given the tragedy that has struck the region of Murcia and specifically, the town of Lorca, I should like to express, on behalf of the Presidency, our solidarity with that community and with all the victims, several of whom have been killed.
Given the widespread dependence on imports, the Member States feel a common need to seek methods for the smart and sustainable use of those resources and raw materials needed to produce energy, as well as for industry or food production.
Given this and the importance of the office of President of the European Central Bank, I believe that Mr Draghi fulfils all the conditions to perform the mandate for which he has now been nominated with skill and dedication.
Given what is at stake, however, I am confident those hurdles will be taken successfully.
Glances exchanged between Europe and Russia have always been characterised by mutual admiration and, simultaneously, by mutual fear.
Global challenges, such as financial markets, energy security, combating poverty, climate change and human rights violations require joint and coordinated action.
Global demand and greater realisation of the need for food security means agriculture will be a growth area for the EU going forward and particularly important for less developed economies.
Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) can have important and extremely useful applications for all modes of transport.
Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) currently have implications for all EU policies, and their development and application will have a catalytic effect on implementing the Europe 2020 strategy and on creating a strategic and competitive European sector.
Globalisation implies, among other things, the dispersion of centres of power and the collective management of common problems and interests.
Globalisation is, in fact, only serving to pit the workers of all countries against each other in unfair competition, whether through relocations, the immigration of job-seekers or the infamous General Agreement on Trade in Services Mode 4. The problem is that the European Union produces lots of fine talk on the subject but never puts it into practice.
Go on then, I dare you! We need more Europe and more integration where Member States are tempted to protect only their individual interests.
Going back to the Arsenis report, on Amendment 25, one of my colleagues over there requested a roll-call vote because he felt it was important.
Good progress is being made in the negotiations on a free trade agreement between the EU and India.
Governance for innovation must mean establishing new partnerships enabling efficient innovation systems that mobilise intellectual and entrepreneurial capacities, detecting also sleeping innovators - of which we have many in Europe - through a business environment that is conducive to innovation, and particularly for SMEs, covering all sectors of the economy.
Governmental authorities representing the North signed the comprehensive peace treaty with the stipulation that the question of self-determination for South Sudan was to be resolved during the referendum.
Governments are elected, unlike Baroness Ashton, the European Commission and the European Central Bank, yet this text seeks to make the latter our sole representatives. I voted against this attempt to give the kiss of death to State sovereignty on the international arena.
Governments still refuse to let the Commission easily send a warning and impose financial sanctions.
Grants the Registrar of the Court of Justice discharge in respect of the implementation of the Court of Justice budget for the financial year 2009.
Great emphasis is placed on strengthening the European Urban Agenda, on developing basic physical infrastructure and its contribution to the economic fabric, and on energy and environmental sustainability through investment based on technological progress, but people are sidelined.
Greater cohesion should be fostered both within the UN system and between the positions of EU Member States and candidate and potential candidate countries, so as to maximise the potential offered by the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the EU's impact through the coordinated and strategic use of its various and distinct (EU and Member State) entry points.
Greater competition is required in the sector and we must break up this historic oligopoly and try to bring in new, independent and possibly European organisations, which would therefore have a proper awareness of the economic context and reality of our continent, which is entirely different from the way of thinking in the United States.
Greater consistency is needed in EU development aid and cooperation policy, particularly with regard to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries.
Greater controls are therefore to be welcomed and I hope that the new European authority will manage to operate at optimum capacity, with real powers to intervene and even to issue penalties where necessary. I also believe that it is a fine idea to introduce the principle of civil liability in situations of obvious negligence.
Greater flexibility of the funds, the simplification of their administration and strategic coordination between instruments, policies and actors is a long-standing demand and a necessary tool for the social inclusion of marginalized groups within a complex policy framework of integrated policies, making use of all the EU financial resources available under the EU funds, and in particular under the ERDF, ESF and EAFRD.
Greater freedom in defining countries' priorities will offer genuine opportunities for agricultural regions to develop.
Greater mobility for young people, a greater capacity to develop opportunities for work, and a labour market that must take into consideration not only young people working in a given context, but all the sectors that provide opportunities for young people to grow.
Greater simplification and reduction of administrative costs to European and Canadian companies will bring greater economic competitiveness and safety for passengers.
Greece and other states are heavily in debt, although billions from the structural funds have been poured into these countries for many years.
Greece has received a package of coordinated bilateral loans from Member States as well as a loan from the IMF.
Greece has the potential to access a significant amount of European funds under the cohesion policy. I believe we should increase their rate of absorption and accelerate those funds, aiming for a significant impact on improving competitiveness and employment.
Greece is still living beyond its means, and the key is that Greece has to start earning more than it consumes and also be able to pay the interest rates on its debt burden.
Greece, Italy and Malta are obviously not in a position to secure their external borders and newcomers to the Schengen Group often relax their efforts after accession.
Greening events dealing with the environment in Pillar 1 must be clear, properly designed and easy to measure, and funding for Pillar 2 must be strong and fair.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world and is best known as a measure of macro-economic activity. GDP does not reflect current environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion or social progress in general. I agree with the Commission's proposal to develop additional indicators for measuring medium and long-term economic and social progress, and to establish clear and measurable indicators that provide information on climate change, biodiversity, resource efficiency and social inclusion.
Gross domestic product (GDP) is the standard macro-economic indicator, used, as a rule, to measure the economies of various states.
Gross domestic product is an outdated indicator based on economic principles that, by reducing quality to quantity, overlook the meaning of things and individual and collective well-being, undervalue work in itself compared to the object of production, and consider only the production of new objects, not maintenance.
Gross domestic product is the best known measure of macro-economic activity and is used in political analysis and discussions worldwide to indicate social development.
Gross domestic product no longer seems able to meet growing economic and political requirements. I think it is necessary to find a complementary system which could contribute to improved policy analysis and debate through the use of clear supplementary indicators for measuring medium- and long-term economic and social progress.
Gross domestic product, or GDP, is an instrument designed to indicate the aggregated added value of all money-based economic activities.
Grouping together and simplifying all the existing legislation on indications or marks will facilitate controls and the identification of any illegal practice.
Growth is the answer, and we will work with the Greek authorities and the Greek people to achieve that objective.
Guantánamo: imminent death penalty decision (debate) 
Guidelines on the prudent use of these substances have already been issued in numerous Member States, which has led to a reduction in their usage.
Guillermo Fariñas, last year's winner of the Sakharov Human Rights Prize, has accused the Cuban regime and, in particular, the First Secretary of the Communist Party, Raúl Castro, of Juan Soto's death.
Had Mr Gollnisch made the same statement in a part-session of the European Parliament or in one of his committees, would the same argument be being made? The content of the press release serving as a basis for extradition is moreover 100% covered by freedom of expression.
Had these powers been limited to euro zone countries alone, I would not have objected, but instead we see the Commission and many Members in this Parliament - including Ms Wortmann-Kool, for whom I have the utmost respect - using the crisis in the euro zone as an excuse to extend the power of the EU into the economic governance of the United Kingdom and other countries who do not use the euro. I was not elected to grant the EU more powers over the way the United Kingdom governs its affairs and I shall therefore vote against these proposals.
Had they done so, they would have learnt that Mr Gollnisch was only indirectly responsible in this affair and that it related to his freedom of political expression.
Had we accepted the compromise, we would have found it empty.
Happily, many regions have succeeded in exceeding the threshold for the maximum funding of 75%. However, if there is less poverty in the various regions of Europe, then European solidarity may also recede.
Harassment of the opposition and of independent human rights groups have now become a chronic problem in the country.
Has a plan already been outlined enabling the Commission to resolve the issues relating to market access? Can the existing differences in terms of economic structures and regulatory systems be overcome in the near future?
Has a reform in your criminal justice system been considered so that prosecutors have some discretion as to whether to issue an arrest warrant and do not have to pursue every single complaint? In that way, the famous small offences like the stolen piglet would not be so much of a problem.
Has the Commission included processed canned fish products as part of food aid packages sent by the European Union to countries suffering from a humanitarian crisis? Would the Commission not agree that processed canned fish products are ideally suited for food aid as the product is high in protein, has a long shelf life and can be supplied at short notice?
Has the fact actually ever been discussed - and this is another issue - that always right on time just prior to an Ecofin meeting, just before a European Council, one, two or three credit rating agencies assess whatever is on the table as a solution to the problems as being inappropriate? Who in actual fact are the people who are wielding the real power over economic development in Europe? Who is behind them?
Has the suggestion of a permanent body to coordinate both civilian and military disaster response from the EU and Member States made any headway?
Have we begun to learn from these events? I would like to think so. What is worse is that the waves of migrants coming to our shores in flimsy vessels, who are dying at sea - and let me point out that we have inadequate information on the number of deaths - are all too often met by division, quarrelling, closed borders, with some countries even calling into question the Schengen Area, an essential instrument for freedom of movement.
Have you campaigned against Syria chairing the UN Human Rights Council? Have you pushed for an international inquiry into the massacres? Even if you do not manage to persuade the Heads of State - and I agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit here - say so, do not leave us guessing! It is this ambiguity that weighs us down.
Having Syria on the Human Rights Council would be an insult to the victims and their families, and an encouragement for that regime to use brute force against its own people, with complete disregard for the values that the Human Rights Council is supposed to uphold.
Having a common, stronger voice in our foreign policy is certainly a good thing, but it cannot diminish the importance of the foreign policy of the Member States themselves, or its flexibility or independence.
Having a homogenous formula for a social clause that could be inserted in all bilateral trade agreements is what is proposed in the report that we have just adopted on the external dimension of social policy and the promotion of social standards.
Having complained that no quotes have been used during this debate, I would now like to quote from the new Hungarian constitution: 'We are proud of the fact that our country has been part of Christian Europe for 1 000 years and we are aware of the role of Christianity in sustaining our nation'. I am pleased to find such sentiments in a constitution.
Having considered all the arguments, the Committee on Legal Affairs recommends that the European Parliament should waive the parliamentary immunity of Bruno Gollnisch.
Having considered the reasons in fact and in law for and against waiving the Member's immunity, the Committee on Legal Affairs recommends that Parliament waive Mr Severin's parliamentary immunity, but also believes that, until a final sentence is passed, the Member should be immune from any form of detention or remand or any other measure which prevents that Member from performing the duties proper to his mandate.
Having consulted with the political groups, I would like to submit to the House the following proposed amendments to the final version of the draft agenda:
Having had recourse to the bailout mechanism, Greece, Spain and Portugal have come under heavy pressure from the Commission and the IMF to make major changes to industrial relations and collective bargaining procedures under the terms of the respective 'Memorandums', thereby overturning national guarantees for workers.
Having made these additional comments, let me conclude by reiterating my confidence about tomorrow's vote and in the quality of the Dess report. I can promise you that in October, when the Commission presents its legislative proposals, you will recognise all the key elements. I would like to thank you once again for this work, which has brought real added value to the legislative package that the Commission will be tabling.
Having noted, and I quote and now utter the following euphemism - 'a lack of values and ethics in the behaviour of certain actors in the financial markets and institutions' - this Parliament has set off on a pathetic crusade to inject some ethics into the sector.
Having purchased a huge amount of Greek Government bonds, and also having accepted much as collateral, the ECB is now trapped.
Having said that, I think it was a useful discussion because, when there is corruption, someone is corrupted but there is also someone doing the corrupting, so in a way, the G8 members were also scrutinised when we discussed the issue of Africa.
Having said that, I think the new factor of the analysis of macroeconomic imbalances can be useful. I apologise, Commissioner, not only for detecting problems of bubbles in the property or financial markets, but also for pointing out the importance of Europe's major problem: the tensions generated by the completely divergent ways in which the economies that make up the euro area evolve.
Having said that, it should also be mentioned that some of these investments will come back in, for instance, saved oil expenditure.
Having said that, what needs to happen before ex-ante controls are improved? How can we ensure improvement of the management of implementing organisations? What will the Commission do in order to increase further the capacity of beneficiary countries and regional organisations and what is necessary for that to happen? In the future, the EU development policy should spend more on funds which offer access to financial services, that is microfinancing funds.
Having said this, I have voted in favour of Amendment 1 because I am completely against using common agricultural policy funds to provide the resources needed for the programmes.
Having said this, I stated in my explanation of vote that I voted in favour. I continue to believe in Europe, just as I continue to believe in the effectiveness of the presence of a High Commissioner.
Having said this, it is fair to say that we concur with the Commission's aim of improving Schengen governance by reviewing the evaluation mechanism on the basis of a Community approach.
Having said this, the European Central Bank's credibility relies on the absolute determination of the euro area governments to do whatever it takes to ensure the financial stability of the euro area, so I have no doubts about the system's ability, of the efforts in the euro area and the credibility of the European Central Bank. I have no doubts about the capacity of the European Central Bank to defend European interests, nor about the commitment of the Member States of the euro area to provide all the guarantees the European Central Bank needs to fulfil its independent role as our central bank.
Having weighed up the issues, I abstained from voting.
He allegedly claims to have met David Cameron and persuaded the Department of Health to consider his proposal for an NHS voucher scheme.
He asked you from whom you actually take your orders and which of the 27 nations you can actually speak about - and I think those questions have resonated in the Chamber today.
He certainly proved during the time that negotiations were going on that he had a very big back indeed, because there were a lot of people throwing knives at him during that period.
He got loans, services, advisers and the breadth of things that could make a difference, so I think that it is a good model.
He has all the requisites for being an excellent President of the European Central Bank.
He has also worked in the area of defence, has handled finances and budgets at a high level and was also a supporter of Swedish membership of the EU.
He has served as director general of the Swedish Companies Registration Office, an independent government agency, and as state secretary on several occasions.
He is a Dutch national who was extradited to Poland on the basis of a European Arrest Warrant for an affair dating back to the mid-1990s.
He is not only emblematic because of Guantánamo and the death penalty, but also because he is one of the only two named victims of secret detentions in Europe.
He is usually a man, although his female equivalent can increasingly be found stalking our corridors in her sharp trouser suit.
He said he wanted to have a meeting with Callaghan - I think it was - the British Prime Minister, on some issues and Callaghan said why not combine this with a good game of golf? So Ford said, well, the Canadian Prime Minister, Trudeau, is a good player, we should invite him, and then Trudeau - welcoming the invitation - said he had some issues to solve with the French, so why not invite the French Prime Minister.
He said it is necessary for this mechanism to be able to provide countries with flexible credit lines.
He said that, when Henry Kissinger was criticised for the United States' isolationist stance, particularly in relation to the European Union, he replied 'There is no fellow foreign minister nor a phone number I can call to speak to Europe'.
He spent two months in prison for this, in appalling conditions.
He spoke very clearly; we may not like what he said, but at least he was clear in what he said and we are grateful for that. I consider it only right that you are here. I do not think there is particular cause to mention it. Nonetheless, it is good that you are here.
He would have noticed that economies are stagnating, jobs are being lost and industries struggling to compete in a fast-changing world.
He, too, is currently under arrest, and he, too, is being persecuted simply because the Lukashenko regime is afraid of free speech - it is afraid of free speech, which is the foundation of every democracy. I think that we Europeans, assembled in this Chamber today, have no option other than to say very loudly: 'yes' for a free Belarus, 'yes' for democracy in Belarus and 'yes' for the Belarusian nation in Europe.
Helping other countries to construct stable democratic societies in countries governed by the rule of law, where human rights are observed and freedom of speech is guaranteed, with a solid judicial system, territorial defence and armed forces, is a commendable plan. I hope that we will succeed in putting it into effect on a wider scale, making even more efficient use of funds.
Hence I am particularly delighted that the proposals contained in my 2008 report on port State control have become key principles underpinning EMSA's work.
Hence my pressing question: how, in this new situation, will the European Union apply its own Quartet principles? Conducting business as usual with Ramallah implies at any event letting go of these fundamental principles of peace.
Hence my question to the Commissioner: what are the most important changes that have been made to ensure that, this year, there is no repeat of the failure of last year's stress test?
Hence, I am calling for the de minimis aid threshold to be increased from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per firm.
Hence, I support the report.
Hence, it is vital to ensure that agricultural products can be traced from farm to fork at European level.
Hence, the importance of this resolution which insists on the need for the European Union to adopt other indicators in addition to GDP in order to take better account of, among other things, climate change, biodiversity or even social integration, these being major political challenges that are close to my heart. I voted for this report because defining and implementing a new range of indicators is an important challenge for measuring the quality of life of European citizens more accurately, and improving the political answers that cannot be drawn up solely on the basis of GDP. I think that this initiative is the first encouraging step towards greater account being taken of social and environmental issues in European public policies.
Hence, the proposal to establish a common European contract law, which would benefit consumers and help ensure increased cross-border trade within the Internal Market.
Hence, we have a duty to ensure that they all have access to vocational education and training.
Hence, we need to establish rules and standards governing their ratings and their impartiality. I voted in favour of the report by Mr Klinz because I think it is essential for the European Union to have adequate rules to manage the impact of ratings on the overall financial and economic system.
Her Majesty's Government is nevertheless a government that wants to take decisions, that wants to reform not only the UK but also the European Union.
Her skills, political experience, moral authority and perfect command of English, coupled with her experience of working across the globe, make her the ideal candidate for the post of Managing Director of the IMF.
Here I cannot accept the Commissioner's point of view that we should keep the two matters separate. I think they are linked in the eyes of the voters, and they are linked in my eyes. I would certainly not vote for an agreement unless this dispute is settled before we reach the final stages of this deal.
Here I should like to emphasise - as has been mentioned a couple of times today already - that there have been departures from my original report on some matters. I have been in the political game too long, and I know exactly why I drafted the report as I did.
Here again, there is an agreement among the Members and groups of the European Parliament that discharge should be postponed.
Here in the Chamber today we have again mentioned research, development, social cohesion and energy, all priorities for which the budget is the most important indicator of the seriousness of our intentions.
Here is a country that has not really moved forward in terms of political rights since the break-up of the Soviet Union.
Here we have the proposal. I would like the strongest possible support from Parliament because then, we can discuss this with the Member States and raise with them the issue of whether they all want to be number one or whether they are happy to be number three. I think that choice is simple and I am looking forward to this debate and to the vote on Wednesday.
Here we have young people - who organised themselves via social networks like Facebook - arrested and sentenced to up to two and a half years imprisonment because they peacefully demonstrated under the slogan 'drug abuse'. Others are threatened with a similar fate.
Here, I should stress that it is crucial that national authorities do not rush to give information on any source of infection which is not proven by bacteriological analysis, as this spreads unjustified fears in the population all over Europe and creates problems for our food producers selling products in the EU and outside the EU.
Here, I think we are talking about Guantánamo Bay. I think we are talking about secret prisons. I think we are talking about gross abuses of human rights and I think they are taking place in the biggest imperialist power in the world - the United States - and they should be condemned here.
Here, I would like to pay tribute to Ms Wallis, our President for today, Mr Casini, our rapporteur, and also to Mr Leinen and Ms Durant.
Here, I would specially mention the case of Mr Hajiyev. I think the authorities should understand that peaceful demonstrations are a natural part of political life in any democratic country and that the pluralism of opinions and political beliefs is a fundamental part of a democratic society.
Here, there is obviously the risk of conflicts of interest as well as of this being an invitation to freeloaders.
Here, too, it must be ensured that the willingness of both employers and workers exists and increases when it comes to taking advantage of further training and continuing to gain education by means of lifelong learning.
Here, too, the task is to achieve better coordination between the various funds, which is a general objective for the joint strategic framework.
Here, too, we are faced with problems that we are actually already aware of. However, because we shy away from entering into a debate with the medical sector, the pharmaceuticals industry and the intensive livestock farming sector - there is a great deal to be addressed here - we are also not being as consistent as we need to be in the way we deal with the matter of antibiotics resistance. EHEC and antibiotics resistance are both major problems.
Here, we can still achieve a great deal for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Herr Kommissar Oettinger, ich bitte Ihnen ... Commissioner Oettinger, please answer this: if Russia agrees to carry out stress tests on their nuclear plants with reference to the criteria that I am now pushing for, do you believe that it will actually improve our safety, given that there are several Chernobyl-type reactors close to the EU's borders?
Hiding behind words without resolving the matter directly can no longer be an option when admission to the Schengen area has never been a political problem, but a technical one.
High unemployment among young people is one of the Commission's top priorities and is one of my foremost personal concerns.
High-quality vocational education and training must both respond to the demands of the labour market and create the conditions for workforce mobility.
Highlighting the synergies between the different agents involved, developing young people's independence, taking action to stop young people leaving education early, reasserting the importance of vocational training and apprenticeships, adopting a binding European quality framework for training schemes: these are the kinds of good ideas that it is important for us to air now at national level.
Highly qualified and well-educated people represent a competitive advantage for the EU, and support for vocational education should take this into account.
His candidature is an important political signal for Italy, after his brilliant experience as Director-General of the Treasury and Governor of the Bank of Italy from 2006, during which time he successfully promoted Italy on the European and international scene.
His experiences within the European Financial Stability Board and at the head of the Bank of Italy are sizeable assets for the visibility of the institution at international level and hence for the European Union's place as the world's largest economic power.
His prestigious career, ranging from his academic appointments to his position at the highest levels of the economic and financial world as chairman of the Financial Stability Board, makes him a top-drawer candidate for the office of President.
His purpose in doing so was to analyse and contribute to the social 'question' which - today as in 1991 - can only be resolved by referring to Christian doctrine and, hence, by recognising the absolutely indiscriminate dignity of the human being and the worker.
His stage was the ruins of the devastated national library in Sarajevo; his audience consisted of a small group of people who had remained, despite the siege of the city, and who were listening to his music.
Historical criteria are to be removed and objective criteria are required.
History has taught us that caution is necessary, but delays or hesitation in the face of unsatisfactory results can be devastating.
Hitherto a key reference, despite leading to possible errors of appreciation (for instance, the rebuilding that follows natural disasters is recorded as economic progress), GDP on its own will no longer do. I voted for Mrs Rosbach's report since it calls on the Commission to continue its research in this area by challenging the reluctance of the Conservatives who believe that only GDP is reliable and the illusions of a section of the left who would like us to measure precisely ... happiness! The Commission's work will have to be closely monitored because it could lead to an important development: a new, more appropriate method of calculating how European funding is allocated to the regions (regional policy). Until now, funding has been granted on the basis of GDP per person in the regions concerned.
Hitherto at EU level, key policy initiatives for environmental accounts include the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, the EU sustainable development strategy and various sectoral policy initiatives related to the Cardiff process, covering areas such as climate change, sustainable transport, nature and biodiversity, health and the environment, natural resource use and waste management and the international dimension of sustainable development.
Hitherto, however, this procedure has rarely been applied. I agree with the position set out in the resolution that the European Parliament should make greater use of the powers it has been given in this field.
Hitherto, this policy has been fragmented and more oriented towards academic and scientific research, rather than transforming innovative ideas into real or adapted products or services that would stimulate growth and job creation.
Honourable Member, what you said reflects my own thoughts precisely. I agree with you completely.
Honourable Members, I hope that the avenues and initiatives I have indicated will be followed up with effective action within the Member States.
Honourable Members, we are in a situation where the financial industry is slowly recovering from this crisis, an unprecedented struggle - even though, for some banks, the crisis already seems to be over.
Honourable Members, we have to do as much as we can to support countries across the world.
Hopefully, that is a first step towards further earmarking of this money.
Hopefully, the revision of the Small Business Act will help us to understand and evaluate where we should increase our efforts so that we can establish an environment that works better for small business.
How and to what extent should ITER be financed? The subject has now become a recurrent item on the agenda of the European Parliament.
How are we going to follow up on this report? We are asking the European Commission to draw up a White Paper, following on from its Green Paper, so as to perform a review leading to a genuine strategy for the creative and cultural industries.
How can an EU which, in alliance with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and the United States, is promoting a war, and violating international law and the UN Charter in Libya, contribute to making the UN more democratic, or to humanity's peace and progress? How can the EU contribute to non-intervention in states' internal affairs, and respect their sovereignty and independence, and their right to development - rights enshrined in the UN Charter and in international law - when, in partnership with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it is imposing an unprecedented programme of aggression against the workers and people of Portugal, and of the usurping of their resources? It cannot.
How can it in fact be the case that in this Union - in which one of our greatest achievements as regards fundamental freedoms is the freedom of movement of our citizens - suddenly two heads of government can simply arbitrarily render ineffective one of our really great achievements - that was an excellent phrase you used in your speech - because of a marginal problem that can easily be managed? How can that be possible? All that is needed for these people to win is for us not to fight sufficiently against it. I would therefore have liked to see you fight it.
How can they get out of this situation? Through a neutral, inclusive and consensual transition process.
How can we be? The answer is as researchers, scientists, policy makers, workers on the shop floor, consumers and citizens.
How can we get an overall picture at European Union level, when only 19 countries have provided the basic indicators needed for the purposes of comparison? Although we have asked the Commission to improve the consistency and quality of the information obtained, there is a transparency vacuum, a lack of available data.
How can we possibly know what human society and Planet Earth will look like ten thousand years from now?
How can we talk about a trade war if, at the same time, we want to label cloned meat and the meat from descendants of cloned animals? We should have made more effort in this area and not said immediately, as soon as the Americans expressed their doubts, that we could not do this. I am calling on the Commission to see this as an argument for producing a new proposal.
How can you justify this distinction?
How can you talk about regional cooperation programmes with third countries when the democrats of Tunisia and Libya are seeing us closing our countries' borders? Is it possible to talk about that? We cannot say ambiguous things.
How cautious we have been in the way we have talked about condemning the human rights violations perpetrated by a country which claims to be the greatest democracy in the world, which still has the death penalty, and for which Guantánamo is an illustration to the world of human rights and international law violations committed in the name of combating terrorism.
How could I remain indifferent about a text on pluralism and the concentration of power in regulatory authorities such as those set out in the still fresh Hungarian media law? We should all worry about democracy when a ruling party passes laws that cement its power well beyond the end of its term and limits the relevance of future elections, and about political leaders going as far as writing or amending fundamental laws that fit only their political credo or economic policies.
How did we try to achieve this? On the one hand, we were engaged in continuous dialogue with both countries, watching their efforts and attempting to help them find ways to get a better recognition of their efforts.
How do you propose to ensure that this support for the CAP is maintained in the new EU multiannual financial framework?
How do you think that we can incorporate these ambitions within the framework of the Innovation Union into all the work that we do in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, into all the other documents that are still to come, into the common strategy framework, into all the research funding and into future programmes? How can the Commission ensure that, ultimately, a single thread runs through all these policy elements so that we actually attain the objectives set in this Innovation Union?
How does Mrs Ashton intend to establish a uniform voice for the EU at the United Nations, and how does she intend to build a good image for the EU in this organisation?
How does the Commission intend to develop the next programme, from 2014 on? I believe that this subject is of particular interest to many people active in European Union affairs and many of the youngsters in our countries.
How does the Commission intend to promote closer participation by the regions, what means will be used, and what funding will be provided?
How does the Commission propose to combat the use of the Internet by criminal gangs across Europe?
How has it been able to continue for so long? I think that either the British Government should not be entitled to any rebate at all or that other countries which find themselves in a similar situation to that which Great Britain was in in 1984 should be treated the same. I hope that the Commission proposals will, in fact, move in this direction.
How is it more in the public interest and more democratic for us to know what Mr De Magistris thinks of a fellow Member than for us to know what the Front National thinks about the riots in Romans or the dangers of mass immigration? It is precisely because the opponents of Bruno Gollnisch did not like the press release in question, even though it is of greater public interest, that he is losing his immunity.
How is it supposed to work if, on the one hand, a protectorate is de facto established - Greece - and on the other the taxpayers in better-off nations have their bonds plundered via the European Central Bank and the bad banks? How can you explain to people who were adamant that they should not give up the schilling and the mark that we now suddenly need Eurobonds simply because the banks cannot be kept in check - by the way, Mr Hughes, it is very nice that the social democrats have now realised this.
How is it to be financed? By a new European tax, of course! Who are they trying to kid? Europe already costs a great deal.
How often is this not synonymous with policies and practices that cancel out or disrespect each country's identity and cultures?
How should we classify the middle-class protests in the Arab countries? The underlying causes are both political and economic.
How the accountability of members of boards of directors is organised must be clearly defined, and must be put into practice in a reasonable way, so as not to jeopardise financial institutions' willingness to seize business opportunities, which is a desirable aspect of their work, or the quality of the human resources at their disposal.
How the bacteria were actually created is a different case; research and findings are needed urgently.
How will you now conduct the dialogue? It says in your communication that, at the end of 2011, you will hold a convention and take some other action. I have already had the opportunity to speak with you a couple of times, including in the form of a dialogue, at the knowledge for innovation summits in this House.
How will you organise that from here on in? We want to see more of you.
How would the national parliaments react to such a suggestion? If you would not dare to try it nationally, please do not attempt it at European level.
How would you explain this? What did you really and factually commit to the southern Mediterranean neighbourhood policy within the context of the only amount of money that has been mentioned by you?
How, and with what provision in the draft budget will the Commission attempt to achieve by next year the objective of an average 1% increase in employment in the EU?
How, though, can we be better prepared than we were four years ago when faced with the crisis that originated in the United States and nearly swept everything away? By creating tools, frameworks for governance, supervision, responsibility, transparency, everything that was lacking, everything that had been part of the very powerful tide of ultraliberalism that first swept through the world in the 1990s, everything that was partially dismantled, too, with the foolish idea that the markets could regulate themselves.
However - and the Socialists have been saying this for a long time - Europe will not emerge from this crisis by sacrificing its future and selling tomorrow's growth on the cheap.
However I would once again ask that we should remember the problem of bureaucracy when implementing this law.
However the EU cannot do everything on its own: it must cooperate more with the relevant international organisations (ILO, WTO, OECD), in particular, for combating the phenomenon of free zones, as these go against any social legislation.
However the repayment will come from the ordinary taxpayer: in other words, Ireland, Portugal and Greece are being sent the bill for propping up the entire European banking system.
However the titles held by the banks until final maturity are listed in the banking book.
However through this vote, I call upon Parliament's President and the Members who are negotiating the Union budget on behalf of Parliament to suggest to the Council that it take steps to ensure that the Union can make these savings.
However we must be careful about where we do so: one proposal would be to reduce military spending; another would be to reduce the two European Parliament sites to a single one.
However, Article 51 of the Charter states that its provisions are addressed to the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the EU, with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, and to the Member States only when they are implementing EU law.
However, EU 'assistance' has demonstrated that it has little to do with solidarity.
However, Europe's framework programme has a reputation for being the most bureaucratic in the world.
However, I abstained in the vote because this own-initiative report contained a point which I thought was particularly weak, which made it impossible for me to vote in favour.
However, I accept that it should improve transparency regarding estimates and who has responsibility for projects, procurement procedures, and follow-up of potential irregularities.
However, I agree - as the report says - that the carryover of appropriations needs to be better managed because they are in breach of the budgetary principle of annuality. I also agree with the observations by the Court of Auditors about delays in procurement procedures. I have a positive take on the effort made to bring in a centralised system for registration of incoming invoices, which is necessary to improve their management.
However, I agree with the rapporteur that the EU needs to demand that Japan, inter alia, remove tariff barriers and obstacles to public tenders before negotiations can begin. I also believe Parliament must send a positive signal in the wake of the tsunami which devastated part of the Japanese coast with enormous loss of life and property, not to mention the Fukushima nuclear plant.
However, I also believe that nuclear power should be part of our future energy mix.
However, I also challenge you to give your full attention to Union legislation to guarantee labour, salary, maternity and illness protection, and social security rights for domestic workers, both male and female.
However, I also think that we need to look at exploring areas within Europe that have not been explored before because it was not economically viable to do so. Now that is changing. I think if we could increase the supply within Europe, that would automatically bring down world prices and also, of course, make us less dependent on non-democratic regimes for our supply.
However, I also think that we need to utilise this momentum that we have created together, Commissioner Šemeta - and I would ask you to pass on our thanks to President Barroso - and this dynamism for the other discharge reports.
However, I am bound by law and legislation.
However, I am concerned, Commissioner. I am concerned about the silence of the Presidency of the Council at the start of this debate concerning this mechanism, and I am also concerned about the Council's year-long silence concerning the mechanism for resettling refugees, as already mentioned by Mr Tavares.
However, I am highly critical of Parliament's Prize for Journalism, and I do not believe that it is appropriate for Parliament to award prizes to journalists whose task it is to critically examine the European Parliament. I therefore believe that this prize should be abolished.
However, I am not here to discuss what should be agreed among competent Members of the Commission and the International Monetary Fund with the participation of the Greek authorities.
However, I am pleased that in recent years, we have succeeded in implementing almost all the provisions of the Small Business Act in the European Union.
However, I am sure that there are also other options.
However, I am very proud of the fact that a Roma strategy was devised during the Hungarian Presidency which determines clearly the obligations of every Member State in connection with the community of this difficult fate.
However, I believe that it is vital to increase Cedefop's involvement in structural measures aimed at vocational training, including the introduction of a system for assessing the effectiveness of training. I also believe that the agency has superb potential to draft an attractive proposal in this respect.
However, I believe that recognition of their usefulness should always depend on respect for certain fundamental principles, such as transparency and independence. I therefore agree with the rapporteur when she underlines the fact that the Commission has recently raised the quality of its impact assessments, while pointing out that further improvements are still needed.
However, I believe that the agreement should be balanced and encourage fair trade.
However, I believe that we have to go beyond this 'Youth on the Move' programme and, above all, avoid the trap of wanting every young person to go to university.
However, I believe this is also simply about realising what we can achieve in this highly sensitive area in the Eighth Framework Programme for Research.
However, I call on both the Commission and the Member States to actually do something with the data that these accounts will provide.
However, I call on the Centre to take more effective measures to remedy its constant rise in surplus; I note, in fact, that for several years the Centre has had an accumulated budget surplus contrary to Regulation (EC) No 2965/94, and that in 2009 the surplus amounted to EUR 24 000 000, whereas it had been EUR 26 700 000 in 2008, EUR 16 900 000 in 2006, EUR 10 500 000 in 2005 and EUR 3 500 000 in 2004; I observe that this surplus is mainly linked to the lack of precision in the forecasts for translation requests received from its clients. I welcome, nevertheless, the Centre's initiative to refund EUR 11 000 000 to its clients in 2009; and I stress that similarly, in 2007, the Centre had already refunded EUR 9 300 000 to its clients
However, I continue to believe that the Member States believe in it much less than we ourselves do. Therefore perhaps it should be pointed out - as was reiterated to Baroness Ashton this morning and on other occasions, too - that, unless Europe stops being partly economic and becomes more political instead, our role probably cannot be carried out as well as it could be, either.
However, I dare to say that a pragmatic sense of crisis-awareness has prevailed and helped us to cooperate in order to contain the sovereign debt crisis and protect economic recovery.
However, I do have doubts over the qualitative assessment of work which has been done.
However, I do hope that after the good quality work they have done on a professional level, they will have enough political weight and agility to reach important goals in other areas, such as the Croatian accession, migration and the very pressing issue of economic governance.
However, I do not agree with the part which condemns the Russians for blocking the gay pride march in Moscow and not giving same-sex couples the right to marry or adopt children. I think that in respect of our approach to homosexual and lesbian movements, every country is fully entitled to pursue its own independent policy.
However, I do not attach any hypocrisy to this because we need a common European position.
However, I do not believe that the register's primary aim is solely to combat corruption as the instances of corruption have, however, been very few and far between.
However, I do regret that with regard to implementing the urban dimension, there is not a clearer signal in favour of a more widespread use of general subsidies for direct management by towns.
However, I feel it is important to highlight the presence of some errors and anomalies that the Court of Auditors revealed in its evaluation of one open procurement procedure, which affected its quality. I therefore add my voice to the call for the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions to take steps to improve its evaluation and review procedure.
However, I feel that the proposal made by the Commission is inappropriate for several reasons.
However, I have doubts that tweaks to the Stability and Growth Pact, that failed so miserably in assuring both stability and growth, are the right solution to Europe's economic woes. I also have grave concerns about reverse qualified majority voting in Council decisions linked to these reports.
However, I have the impression that we care too much about the situation outside the Union and care too little about standards inside the Union, for example, in Poland, because it is in Poland that after the current governing coalition gained control of the public media, it began to dismiss large numbers of journalists and close down their programmes, all of which had one thing in common - criticism of the current situation.
However, I maintain that the challenge of intermediate categories and the safeguard clause is one that we must take on in order to begin a new phase in Europe's cohesion policy and also to realise, within the cohesion policy, the more balanced and sustainable development that we want to assure for Europe over the coming years.
However, I must agree with the report where it states that due to a number of inconsistencies, procedures lacking transparency and carryovers revealed in the budget, the Agency should improve its financial management.
However, I must also mention that, in spite of sustained economic growth, enormous inequalities persist. I would like to highlight the need to ensure the free trade agreement (FTA) does not limit the powers that the Indian Government needs to resolve problems of poverty and inequality.
However, I must say that the proponents of sovereign debt restructuring seem to ignore the potentially devastating implications for financial stability in the country itself and in the euro area as a whole, and the consequences and ramifications for economic growth and employment.
However, I must stress that the success of Europe's economic policy must also depend on other, complementary measures to support investment and growth in the Member States.
However, I put it to the House that the cause of individual liberty under the law in the world would be better served if Parliament took more interest in the operations of the European Arrest Warrant.
However, I regard the issue of European farmers getting preferential treatment or being put at a disadvantage on the basis of additional criteria, for example the size of holdings, as problematic in view of the historically determined nature of the situation in the individual Member States.
However, I regret the shortcomings in the management of the fixed assets' inventory identified by the Court of Auditors but note the Agency's assurance that this will be remedied in the 2010 accounts; considers that uncertainty about the location of fixed assets is another illustration of the problems and additional costs arising from using two sites.
However, I share the rapporteur's concerns about the 27% overstatement of the pre-financing costs to border authorities highlighted by the Court of Auditors and the advances made in excess.
However, I should add that I believe those with political responsibilities in general, including Members, should always tell the truth and use language respectful of their interlocutors, which does not always happen.
However, I should like to ask you whether you seriously expect the European Parliament to negotiate on something that is our right under the treaties.
However, I still believe that the instruments we are discussing today, which will be adopted in the near future, are not exactly adequate and are only economically beneficial for central transit European Union Member States, and are not entirely favourable, or significantly less favourable, for a large number of European Union Member States situated on the EU's external borders.
However, I still believe that these instruments are only economically beneficial and favourable for a few central transit European Union Member States, and therefore completely unfavourable or much less favourable for a large number of European Union Member States, situated near the European Union's borders, both in the east, the south, the west and the north. I therefore believe that it would be worth us fully evaluating this aspect, weighing it up again, and only then adopting it.
However, I think further audits ought to be carried out on the use of some funds and budgetary management ought to be improved in order to reduce the high number of carryovers.
However, I think it is equally important, and perhaps even more important, for there to be specific and real involvement from the European Union in building civil society, providing financial support for non-governmental organisations and free media, and also in imposing economic sanctions.
However, I think it needs to answer a number of questions publicly.
However, I think that as part of future cooperation between the Union and Ukraine, instruments should be created which, in the longer term, would contribute to a strengthening of the rule of law in Ukraine. I have in mind, here, the idea of creating, for example, an advisory group to help bring Ukrainian law closer to European standards, and assistance in various areas of law, including the training of judges, for example. I think Ukraine's European aspirations, which, on the one hand, are hedged around with conditions, should, on the other, show a willingness to help in this. I hope the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union will adopt such a stance.
However, I think that greater responsibility could translate into greater objectivity and more thorough work, which would protect not just the affairs of the few but help reduce information imbalances, which amounts to safeguarding the functioning of the markets and also the general interest.
However, I think that it ought to be limited to rapporteurs who are responsible for drafting a law on behalf of Parliament.
However, I think that this can only benefit European consumers. I agree that we need more time to evaluate the impact of some additional labelling requirements, especially regarding origin, the care treatment method and the introduction of a harmonised size labelling system.
However, I think that this optional instrument deserves a try as it may get rid of some of the administrative burden which is currently preventing SMEs from expanding their businesses in Member States other than their own.
However, I think that, in order to avoid the same mistakes being made in future procedures, SESAR should complete and implement internal control systems and a financial information system which would allow for the most reliable and accurate assessment possible of the budgetary transactions for each financial year.
However, I think the lack of transparency in recruitment procedures and the inquiry opened by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) are worrying. I hope that the Foundation will take the appropriate action on this issue in order to improve its performance.
However, I think these additional measures and the solutions given to the shortcomings mentioned are important, not least as regards the illegal immigration phenomena recorded in Bulgaria because of its peripheral geographical location.
However, I trust that he recognises the mandate which he has been given by MEPs, and accordingly entertains their views as Governor of the ECB.
However, I voted in favour of the tabled amendments, which substantially mitigate the negative impact of the proposal: safeguard clause, limit of one year and the human rights clause.
However, I will give you one example.
However, I will mention it here because we need the help of the members of the European Parliament to go back to their constituencies and explain that the European semester is over and national semesters are starting. I think we know what to do; we have country-specific recommendations which are very fair, very honest and very detailed for each Member State, but now we need the cooperation of the national authorities and of the national governments to actually deliver and to carry out the reforms in the Member States.
However, I wish to point out that members of the Commission are not there to represent countries.
However, I would also ask you to pass on our thanks to your colleagues, because we had a very intense exchange with many individuals - I should particularly like to mention Mr Cioloş and Mr Hahn - and both were very cooperative.
However, I would also like to make a special point about the way current events have been communicated to the general public by German and European authorities, with the serious consequences we know for the fruit and vegetable sector, not only in Spain, but in all our Union.
However, I would also say here that it is perhaps time to have a general European response by accepting Eurobonds and accepting the possibility of selling them on the primary market, to respond to the international markets.
However, I would expressly like to see all these exclusions expire on a particular day. I would like the exclusions to be provided either with a clear time limit or with definite benchmarks, however they are structured - perhaps the Commission could consider what proposals it intends to bring to the table to go some way towards meeting India's demands. I would therefore like very clear limits for all exclusions, whether in the form of time limits or benchmarks.
However, I would have to add that I do not want to see the support for greening in Pillar One imposing further burdens and costs on our farmers.
However, I would like to emphasise once again that our concern has always been to produce a proposal to help those areas of regions which were not among the very poorest but which were still well below the average level and to provide support for the catching-up process.
However, I would like to point out that 13 EU Member States are already functioning without nuclear energy, including countries with successful economies such as Austria and Denmark, so we must be able to accept this possibility in Germany. I would also like to say that Chancellor Merkel gave a government policy statement today in the German parliament and highlighted once again that we must at least make joint progress in the areas we agree on in Europe.
However, I would like to remind you that the coin has another side.
However, I would like us to establish more precisely what overall cost savings the Union will achieve as a result of environmental improvements and to present these figures.
However, I would point out that the compromise reached with the insertion of the review clause and the joint statement by Parliament and the Council on origin marking - the political significance of which is not lost on me - could set a precedent and compromise the outcome of the difficult negotiations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council on the complex issue of origin marking for non-EU products, which Parliament approved at first reading last October and which concerns non-textile products also.
However, I would point out that these are lofty aims that will be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve in reality.
However, I would remind the House - this is something that we faced in Greece recently in important cases - that, even now, there are people being prosecuted for serious crimes of fraud and corruption in a Member State of the Union who disappear or manage to get off and escape arrest by making use of the different procedural provisions and different regulations in the various national laws.
However, I would state, once again, that the call for the introduction of a financial transaction tax has once again appeared in a report which is not directly related to setting out financial policy, and which I do not consider transparent practice.
However, IAs can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator's democratic and legitimate decision-making process. IAs merely contribute to the preparation of the specific content of a political decision.
However, Mr Barroso, it will also be difficult to explain it to citizens if we only concentrate on austerity.
However, Russia does not seem to be budging at all.
However, SMEs continue to face serious problems expanding their activities and innovative capacities and it is difficult for them to access markets, above all, due to difficulties obtaining financing and administrative obstacles, which should also be reduced further.
However, Ukraine must implement the necessary far-reaching reforms, in particular, of the judicial system, the electoral system and the constitution, in order to be able to enjoy the opportunities which this agreement can offer with regard to association and economic integration with the EU. In addition, the country must make more decisive efforts to combat corruption.
However, a change in this system does not give the EU a direct right of taxation, as the Treaty does not provide for any such competence for the Union.
However, a great number of external challenges, particularly in our Mediterranean neighbourhood, mean we cannot afford to wait.
However, a sticking point for me is Commissioner Rehn's statement, which is related to this legislative package.
However, additional measures should be taken by Bulgaria, in cooperation with Greece and Turkey, to address the problem of illegal immigration.
However, after submitting the form, victims receive a letter demanding payment of EUR 1 000 per year for three consecutive years.
However, all options should be kept open and examined at present.
However, all this is an attempt to dress up the product in order to hide its real dangers from the electorate.
However, although this same goal was not achieved by the deadline, it remains the true purpose of common action.
However, ambitious trade measures are essential for the sustained economic recovery of Pakistan's economy and should be part of our medium-term response to those unprecedented natural disasters. I therefore hope that Parliament will support the proposal.
However, and this concerns Mr Stavrakakis, there is also a need for improved cooperation with the other funds in this area and, in particular, the fund for rural development.
However, any reform made to the approach of European Union policies to forests must not simply be reduced to the challenges posed by climate change, but take into account all the aspects relating to forests' contribution to the sustainable development of the environment, the rural economy, etc. at regional, European and global level.
However, any refusal to execute a European Arrest Warrant does not invalidate it. It remains a valid title for the arrest of the person concerned in the issuing Member State and indeed in any other Member State.
However, are there also controls in place in the other direction? We only need to think of the latest move from the music industry association to the copyright department.
However, arguing that it could cause difficulties for business and producers, representatives of the Member States did not endorse the requirement for labelling or traceability, in other words, the minimum requirements for being able to ensure consumer awareness.
However, as Baroness Ashton said last month after the Khodorkovsky/Lebedev judgment, and as the European Court on Human Rights has concluded on many occasions, real progress requires respect for democracy and human rights and a stable and fair legal framework for business, which are too often absent in Russia. A structured civil society dialogue would help; common action to fight climate change would help to build trust.
However, as Mr Klinz rightly points out, this business model risks drawing attention away from protecting investors and towards protecting debt issuers, unless suitable corrective measures are taken. I do not think that competition can be improved, since the proliferation of agencies could undermine the credibility of ratings.
However, as far as Mr Rapkay is concerned it only applies to Mr De Magistris, who is being prosecuted for libel, and not to Bruno Gollnisch, who is being prosecuted for expressing political opinions.
However, as is the case in many other areas of this sector, the crisis has demonstrated three key problems: lack of competition, over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for CRA ratings.
However, as is well-known, they are currently the ones suffering most from the crisis, not least with unemployment reaching extremely high levels: unemployment rates amongst young people are double those for all the other unemployed.
However, as part of the package, the Commission was requested by the European Council and Parliament to assess modalities for their inclusion in the EU reduction commitment by mid-2011, and to make a legislative proposal as appropriate.
However, as regards trade relations between the European Union and third countries, there remain profound differences in terms of social protection systems, as well as of working conditions.
However, as the recent events remind us, it is clear that we need a stable, prosperous Pakistan, which will not go down the slippery slope of extremism and will be able to act as a partner in the anti-terror effort.
However, as there are certain points in the report which are typical of the Bologna policy on education, to which I am opposed, in that it refers to the need to formulate programmes in keeping with the 'needs of the market', which I consider may jeopardise the nature of the programme, I abstained.
However, as various studies have shown, instead of providing business with loans, the national banks in some Member States have tightened lending conditions even more.
However, as we have seen all too often recently, the so-called single voice with which Europe should approach multilateral issues is often damaging to the Member States' own prerogatives and autonomy of decision. I must therefore abstain, because the report has some positive aspects, but they are invalidated by the considerations expressed above.
However, at a time when the economic and financial crisis is heightening social inequalities, structural fund allocations to the Member States are in decline.
However, at domestic level, SMEs constantly encounter difficulties in obtaining financing or in coping with administrative tasks which often exceed the requirements under EU directives.
However, at the moment we simply have to accept that the government in power in Minsk has no policies, no transparency, no democracy and no concept of safety.
However, at the same time, it must be said that all regions must have access to cohesion policy, both Eastern European Member States and strong national economies like Germany.
However, at the same time, it would be completely unreasonable to ignore these challenges, to give in to euroscepticism and give up the political ambitions that the Member States have given us in the Treaty of Lisbon, for example.
However, attempts to bind those of us outside the euro zone with targets and processes designed to harmonise economic policy are unacceptable. I do not wish to see the euro zone in prolonged difficulty, but the ECR cannot support EU legislation that transfers any further powers away from national governments who are currently outside of that euro zone.
However, before implementing it, we should find out more about the possibilities of adapting the new method in everyday life.
However, beyond the current crisis and in order to achieve a sustainable recovery, we are also awaiting far-reaching economic governance reforms because, while we have completed the monetary side of the economic and monetary union, with the euro, the economic side is inadequate, and we are paying a high price for that today.
However, beyond the stated desire to encourage the Member States to step up their investments in the area of education independently from the financial crisis, the report is in the spirit of the policies aimed at liberalising higher education and subordinating it to the sole immediate interests of the market and thus of companies.
However, bilateral safeguard clauses are also important in this agreement. I am thinking of sensitive economic sectors such as the automotive, electronics, aerospace and mechanical engineering industries. I am certain that Japan can and will be a fair and reliable partner.
However, by approving a new constitution that states that the foetus must be protected from the moment of conception, Hungary, a Member State, has trampled on these values by allowing the right to abortion once more to be brought into question.
However, clearly these objectives can only be achieved if the Union's budget is not cut.
However, continuing the reform of the Bologna Process is even more important.
However, conventional national accounts focus mainly on market transactions and on indicators that reflect important factors in creating prosperity, but do not measure prosperity itself.
However, current concerns from Member States are not reactionary, but instead the inevitable consequence of over 20 years of ever-changing circumstances in Europe and around the world.
However, despite all the efforts of the Commission to improve its impact assessment as well as those that we have made in this regard in the European Parliament, the quality of the impact assessment is still in need of improvement.
However, despite our vote in favour, we believe that the interests of the movement of capital should not be promoted at the expense of safeguarding the rights of people and workers.
However, despite these concerns, we will vote in favour of the proposal for a regulation.
However, developments in the regulatory framework have made these 'information intermediaries' de facto 'regulatory licensors'. The recent financial crisis has highlighted that there are three key problems in the industry: lack of competition, over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings by CRAs.
However, do you really think you are on the right track? The European right-wing is getting ready simply to abolish the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy.
However, during further negotiations, it is crucial to address some important issues. I believe that significant attention must be paid to Europe's most sensitive sectors, such as industry, agriculture and the services sector.
However, each Member State has the responsibility to respect the European Community that they are part of. The protection of LGBT people is fundamental to the European Union, and Hungary cannot disregard that.
However, economic policy is not just a simple mechanical sequence of procedures.
However, establishing such safety solely within Europe is no great achievement.
However, fisheries partnership agreements should not simply be a legal way of allowing European vessels to have access to fish stocks in third countries; they should also be a tool to promote sustainable exploitation of all maritime resources.
However, for formal reasons, we must ensure that those businesses which are affected are involved in an appropriate way and, therefore, we need the time to do this.
However, from a more detailed perspective, all the areas designated as pistes must be included.
However, funds for quality public education are increasingly short, and students are faced with a lack of grants, unemployed families and dropping out of their studies, as is happening in Portugal with the restrictive policies that are being practised.
However, given that the term of this agreement is three years and that fishing opportunities have therefore been reduced by half, we are concerned about the fact that the cost of licences has been increased to EUR 40 000 for tuna seiners, although there has been an increase in the number of these ships covered by the agreement.
However, given the complicated nature of the negotiations for the approval of Resolution 1973, we can anticipate the arduous work that awaits you to update and rationalise the representation of the European Union, which is fragmented and dispersed and has an ad hoc status in each of the 249 multilateral agreements involving the European Union.
However, given the current economic situation, perhaps this is not the best moment to adopt this text.
However, given the historical and very successful economic relationship between the EU and Canada, I support an agreement that transcends the commitments made within the framework of the WTO and is in addition to the multilateral rules, so as to achieve the maximum potential of cooperation between these two powers.
However, given the sector's dependence on fossil fuels, and with a view to the new reform, consideration should be given to efforts accompanied by an innovation policy, in addition to the efforts already made to date, so as to make the fishing fleet more energy efficient.
However, given what the Commission has just said - that we have data from 10 Member States and that it is not yet available to us - we really are talking about concerns about which we do not have detailed facts.
However, greater fairness is needed in the distribution of direct payments, both among Member States and farmers. I hope that the future legislative proposal will provide a solution for getting rid of the unfair disparities.
However, having an effective European foreign policy and our own defensive capabilities without having our own intelligence service and a facility for gathering information is like having a house without a roof.
However, having made these statements, the report does not draw out all the consequences of the facts presented, simply making a few inconsequential observations.
However, how can we talk about mutual trust when some Member States are changing the rules of the game midway by introducing new criteria for joining Schengen?
However, if Mr De Gucht believes this to be the case, he will certainly agree with the significant weakening of the instrument for examining existing agreements, which we voted on in an amendment, and with the limitation of the reasons for withdrawing approval to four clear criteria.
However, if nothing else, we could say that something positive has come out of it in that they will have the opportunity to think again and realise that there really is a need now for outside help.
However, if states coordinated their policies and funding in the area of priorities, they would achieve better results and would save more funds than the amount by which we want to increase the common EU budget.
However, if the European Union fails as a transnational project for securing peace and prosperity and breaks apart, then it will be more than just a political union that breaks apart.
However, if this House were to demonstrate its backing for the candidacy of Sarajevo today, I would put my trust in the judiciousness and far-sightedness of the Council, as our arguments are actually irrefutable.
However, if we do not accept the electricity and an electricity exchange is not possible, because we are planning our own nuclear power stations in the Baltic States, we will have less control over the technology used in Kaliningrad than if we had an open electricity market. I will be happy to have more in-depth discussions on this subject.
However, if we do not create this intermediate category, we can be sure that the budget for cohesion policy will be cut.
However, if we take the example of Greece, tens and hundreds of thousands of citizens recently took to the square and the streets around the Hellenic Parliament quite spontaneously, without being directed to do so, angrily calling for a decent standard of living and prospects.
However, if we transfer more responsibilities to the EU, expecting it to finance ambitious projects, while, at the same time, cutting funding, then we will be guilty of acting against solidarity within the European Union because we will encourage internal divisions in the fight for funds, for example, in cohesion policy.
However, if we want to apply serious policy, we should increase funding for our agricultural policy, for a fairer, more effective and more viable common agricultural policy.
However, if we want to be safe, identical criteria should be applied to facilities already existing or planned in the EU's neighbourhood (Russia, Belarus, Turkey, Armenia, Switzerland and Ukraine). As we consistently strive for this, we must speak with one voice.
However, in a world challenged by energy shortages, we need to remain open-minded.
However, in any case, Commissioner, we have to allow the scientists to do their work: they need to investigate the entire traceability system, throughout the food chain, including the handling and distribution of food.
However, in my opinion, closing Schengen's gates to Romania and Bulgaria should not penalise honest citizens, who would suffer the most if they now lost the opportunity to travel freely throughout Europe.
However, in my opinion, this Commission document lacks analysis of research and data on children's education, care and social protection, taking into account information from all 27 European Union Member States.
However, in order for the programme's real benefits to be achieved, there is a need to establish a medium- and long-term strategy for financing and governance, covering the main actions to be carried out.
However, in order to avoid pollution, traffic jams and time-consuming journeys, we need to find new arrangements, such as free park-and-ride schemes combined with flexible monthly cards for several modes of transport, such as bicycles, motorcycles, car sharing, metros, electric buses, underground rail systems, etc.
However, in order to ensure regional cooperation does not serve merely as an excuse to delay decisions, we have added a whole raft of requirements which such cooperation should meet.
However, in order to realise these objectives, territorial cooperation programmes will have to be simplified, and local authorities and the public will need to be more involved by encouraging better communication through a large-scale media and awareness-raising campaign.
However, in order, at the same time, to be credible when asking for more money, we must also have the courage to look at existing structures and existing costs.
However, in spite of the warnings about the humanitarian aspect made to your services, to your collaborators, to your cabinet and to your Director-General, and despite the fact that I submitted a draft statement to you myself, you did not speak out until there had been 32 deaths and more than 300 wounded.
However, in the UK at least, and we will hear this later, the European Arrest Warrant has become a favourite stick with which the Eurosceptics batter the reputation of the EU. Their cause has been helped by several notorious cases of breaches of human rights.
However, in the case of Greece, Commissioner, despite what has been achieved, as you have repeatedly emphasised, with the 7-point reduction in the primary deficit and a 5% reduction in the overall deficit, the fact that the recession was deeper than forecast in 2010 has resulted in less revenue for the State.
However, in the current agreement, we have to say that the car does not seem to be included in the congestion. I am referring to major problems, such as the state of the infrastructure and the fact that things are improving, including in terms of reducing noise or other pollution.
However, in the political field, it was rather quiet on the climate front after Copenhagen and Cancún. Now it is clearly back on the political agenda.
However, in this instance the Council's cooperation was completely inadequate.
However, in view of the results that are now known, the Commission must be urged to supervise the implementation of Directive 2006/114/EC and, at the same time, to test its limits with a view to its improvement.
However, insofar as it is not yet a Member State, it is necessary to define its status - its rights of participation and what responsibilities it should have - in the context of the EMCDDA.
However, insufficient private investment in new high-risk small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), will leave green technology innovation in Europe largely dependent on public funding.According to the OECD, intergovernmental coordination is vital in the EU with its 27 national innovation policies and a plethora of EU programmes (for example, EERP, SET plan, NER 300, Europe INNOVA, Cohesion Fund).
However, is it not sinister that recipients should be told which economic policies they should choose and which they should discard? Surely donors have no right to instruct these new democracies as to which democratic choices they should make?
However, it also brought about massive de-industrialisation and a squandering of state assets.
However, it also provides several valuable insights into the future of cohesion policy.
However, it always adds that such policies should have 'particular focus upon development and strengthening of the internal market': in other words, it wants more neoliberal policies, more privatisations, more free competition, and more policies that favour the strongest over the weakest.
However, it becomes even more serious when these regions are situated in Member States, like Portugal, faced with an extremely serious economic and social crisis, which could shortly be exacerbated by the illegitimate intervention that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Union are preparing.
However, it could also be a sign of hidden protectionism, and sometimes when I hear these speeches I feel that I can both hear and see this.
However, it does not prevent states or supranational organisations from increasing their economic relations beyond that common regulation.
However, it does not say, for instance, that the 'updated Community Customs Code' is far from being fully operational and still has some obvious gaps in it, especially in terms of the complete computerisation of the system, a much-needed measure.
However, it has given mixed results, as the aim of the Commission and the European right has been above all to facilitate cross-border trade, and not to harmonise upwards consumer protection.
However, it is a step in the right direction and it is worth noting that the lobbyists themselves, the reputable lobbyists, actually are in touch and are in favour of compulsory registration.
However, it is also absolutely our duty not to leave our producers high and dry when it is through no fault of their own that they have found themselves in this situation that threatens their very survival.
However, it is also essential to the European Union, and to its fishing fleets in particular. I agree with this proposal, for which I voted, but I think that catch control needs to be scientifically monitored, navigation control systems need to be modernised and wrecks need to be cleaned.
However, it is also necessary to minimise the disastrous consequences this is having on another group of innocent victims, namely, fruit and vegetable producers, as has been mentioned here today.
However, it is becoming ever clearer that we need to stop concentrating strictly on the markets and instead take a more holistic interest in people, which means protecting them, the rights of workers and the right to work.
However, it is both sad and regrettable that the Council representative has once again left the Chamber, because the fact that we have made so little progress in the interinstitutional working group on agencies is primarily the fault of the Council, which is holding back from working with us to introduce improvements in this area.
However, it is clear that there must be some measure of control, and I look forward to hearing details of the Commissioner's strategy in due course.
However, it is desirable for the future to achieve a system of registration that is obligatory 'de jure'.
However, it is essential that we should make numerous further advances, including in relation to the conditions under which prisoners are held and the question of individual standards of legal protection.
However, it is essential to put theory into practice, especially when it comes to mobilising enough financial resources through Union support programmes and measures to enable the monitoring of forests' ecological and phytosanitary state and, wherever necessary, their reclassification, including reforestation.
However, it is essential to safeguard the transparency of the EU institutions' actions so as to ultimately ensure their legitimacy and the thorough consideration of their scope, without misuse of power. I therefore welcome the conclusion of this agreement, which, by making the registration of all lobbyists wishing to enjoy permanent access to Parliament and the Commission de facto mandatory, marks a decisive step in strengthening transparency in the dialogue between the EU institutions and these representatives of civil society
However, it is extremely important that, when we talk about agriculture and the future of the CAP, 'simplification' and 'innovation' are the watchwords.
However, it is highly important that the labour force working for small and medium-sized enterprises be better qualified than at present.
However, it is important to have intelligent taxation, so that the ones paying are not transport SMEs, drivers and still less consumers, but large shippers and major customers such as the large-scale distribution sector.
However, it is incompatible, under EU law, with the new exclusive competence on foreign direct investment.
However, it is much more important to give our young people a European future in Lithuania.
However, it is not even going to be possible to safeguard these procedural rights, which we have already debated and which we are going to discuss as part of the package of procedural rights.
However, it is not that kind of policy which we are talking about, today, is it? This policy is a policy of reducing disparities - disparities will always exist, and there will be new disparities which we are not yet aware of today.
However, it is on the solutions to be found to improve its management and on the general ambition that some differences can be observed, in particular with the Member States, which I do not deny have historically had a certain sovereign responsibility.
However, it is precisely in these areas where the Member States, rather than the EU as a whole, can act, and where they know how best to respond to the educational challenges they face. I am concerned with a number of aspects of the reports we have discussed this morning, especially regarding the intrusion on Member States' subsidiarity in terms of educational targets and social policy.
However, it is precisely this point, extending the scope of the directive to include business dealings between companies, which was opposed by the majority of the Member States during the legislative process at the time.
However, it is still unacceptable that this agency, founded in 2006, has yet to meet the criteria of good administration.
However, it is very important that Member States in the Mediterranean region, together with third countries, continue to cooperate and coordinate their efforts.
However, it needs to be made clear who is to issue a warning and when, who is subsequently to take over responsibility for the warnings, and when the European Commission is to get involved.
However, it seems that it can offer, if not solutions, at least interesting food for thought: it appears obvious to me that training and education should be at the heart of the political priorities of today and of tomorrow.
However, it seems that these are bad times for Pakistan and that too many people are failing to face up to their responsibilities.
However, it should be just one of a series of essential steps towards greater transparency in the legislative process, which should apply to all three European institutions.
However, it should be stressed that the Court of Auditors has, once again, noted a high number of budget transfers in 2009 (49 in 2009, 52 in 2008 and 32 in 2007), so it is desirable that the EMSA improve its planning and monitoring to thus reduce the number of transfers.
However, it should not be regarded as a cure-all, because it also comes with a number of drawbacks.
However, it will also be brought more into line with the second pillar, support for sustainable development. I believe that the greening of the first pillar needs to be judged correctly, so that it does not add to the environmental requirements with which farmers are already seriously burdened.
However, it would be difficult to implement a 'one size fits all' approach. I think that we need to focus rather on establishing a common framework with clearly defined objectives and values.
However, just as important as what the accounts tell us is what they do not tell us about something that is extremely important for the EU's economy. A few days ago, Europol published a report on organised crime in the EU. It made shocking reading.
However, just as we remember the victims from the Baltic States, we also think of the Armenians, who were expelled from Turkey at the start of the last century.
However, knowing how poor the Member States' compliance with the export ban is, there are good reasons for the Commission also to closely monitor the Member States' actions with regard to WEEE and other legislation stipulating how this type of product should be dealt with.
However, knowing the controversy around written declarations, and the differing opinions about their usefulness, I would like to apologise to those Members who felt offended by our campaign, and to repeat the promise I made to the chair of my subcommittee, Mr Danjean: I promise not to start a written declaration again during this parliamentary term.
However, let me add a side comment on that point. I have rather grave reservations about the Museum of European History, in particular, not about the content of the project in itself, but about the costs associated with it. Obviously, it is good that we are going to have such a museum, but what disturbs me greatly about this is that, in this plenary chamber, we have never really had a serious debate about this project.
However, let us just note the successes: between 2005 and 2009, the arrest warrant has secured the extradition of almost 12 000 drug smugglers, child sex offenders, rapists and others.
However, like all other colleagues, I also support stress tests - as does the UK - and I think all Member States should give their commitment to those stress tests.
However, like other technologies, the practical results of the applications are inseparable from the economic and social context in which they occur, and from the ends and objectives they serve.
However, more needs to be done to make improvements in this area and it is for this reason that I supported this report.
However, not enough attention has been given to them equally, as indicated by mid-term evaluations of its implementation.
However, not only have some countries being failing to make this commitment, but in some countries, including Portugal, we have also seen divestment in this type of transport, which tends to increase following the process of liberalisation and privatisation.
However, obtaining a legal judgment is only part of the process.
However, obtaining a legal judgment is only part of the process: citizens and companies must have the right to ensure that these judgments are effectively enforced. A necessary component of effective enforcement is that the courts may, as an interim measure, act swiftly to order disclosure and freezing of the debtor's assets.
However, one can also say that Europe is our answer, as a 21st century continent, to the economic, environmental, financial and migration policy-related challenges in a globalised world.
However, our group has been traditionally opposed to that procedure for both, the form and the content.
However, our main criticism was that it was a measure focusing on a country affected by terrorism without naming this political agenda, and without embedding the measures in a set of measures concerning the political context.
However, particular attention should be paid to the future of the cohesion policy, which I consider to be a very important instrument and one which provides financial support for investments that drive economic growth and, above all, the creation of new jobs.
However, performing credible stress tests is the best way to calm the financial markets and to limit the influence of credit rating agencies and the negative effects of their decisions on the whole of our economy.
However, please accept, on the other hand, the fact that the stress test does not include an automatic mechanism for shutting down a power station simply because you have not been successful with your programmes in your Member States.
However, please note that we also do not want an independent European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
However, problems arise here when the associated cuts in services only affect the citizens of Europe as taxpayers, only leaving services for military use untouched.
However, problems arising from the implementation of these solutions at Member State level may pose a threat to their effectiveness. I am therefore also hoping that the Member States which have not yet fully implemented these measures will make every effort to ensure that this process is completed as soon as possible.
However, regarding North Africa for instance, I must say that - as was just mentioned - what started in Tunisia was, among other things, triggered by the increase in food prices there.
However, sadly, some provisions miss the point. I would have welcomed it if the Council in particular had agreed on more objective solutions that were sympathetic to small businesses.
However, savings cannot be made at the expense of ordinary workers working in the European Parliament; their rights should be safeguarded at all times.
However, simply calling for action is too vague.
However, since credit rating agencies currently operate in an oligopoly, they benefit from an intrinsically 'guaranteed' market.
However, since this report makes very reasonable arguments in this regard, I voted in favour.
However, so-called reproductive rights, which is just another name for the right to abortion, are a priority component of the European human rights agenda.
However, some irregularities remain in the field of human resources, particularly in terms of staff selection procedures, which are thought to lack transparency. I therefore hope that the aforementioned Authority will strive to make improvements in this area.
However, some issues remain outstanding, in particular, the need to establish a plan to combat possible pressure from illegal migration. I therefore agree with the rapporteur that there is a need for the Member States in question to inform Parliament and the Council within a six-month period, beginning on the date of entry into force of this decision, on the implementation of these additional measures and progress with the shortcomings identified.
However, some of these fraudulent practices take place across national borders and are used in business transactions between different companies and, as things currently stand, it is difficult to prosecute the perpetrators.
However, some western German regions require European aid, as do parts of the United Kingdom.
However, structural funds should be used only within the Member States to which they have been allocated.
However, such an approach needs to respect the principle that financial assistance may not, under any circumstances, increase fishing effort.
However, such complicated administrative procedures are now no longer proportionate, particularly as another EU regulation imposes an obligation to indicate a product's country of origin in customs documents before it is released for free circulation in the EU market, and consumer protection is also currently being enhanced in the EU by increasing the amount of information provided to consumers.
However, such dialogue should not substitute but complement and reinforce Turkey's accession track.
However, taking into account the structural trend of oil price increases and, on the other hand, the demands of environmental sustainability, there is also a need for measures ensuring the medium- and long-term viability of the sector.
However, that must be the subject of proper legal proceedings.
However, that obviously should not exempt the European Commission from its duty to continue badgering Member States about this and to maintain pressure on the national security services so that these services actually investigate whether the plants are going to be prepared for those risks, too.
However, the Americans may find that Syria is a hard nut to crack.
However, the Commission has opted to introduce a measure which is simple, effective and timely and which will make it possible: (a) for manufacturers in the EU to sell tractors, overcome the current difficult economic crisis, find new resources for research and comply with the limits laid down by European law for environmental protection purposes; (b) for farmers to replace their oldest tractors with new ones whose engines will be less polluting. I support the compromise as the flexibility scheme could be increased provisionally and exclusively in Stage IIIB or to three years where no subsequent stage exist; for this period the level of flexibility could be maximum 37.50% .
However, the Commission has proposed to increase its commitment and payment appropriations, by 3.7% and 4.9% respectively, with a focus on expenditure related to the Europe 2020 strategy including the ESF, the lifelong learning programme, the Youth in Action programme, the seventh framework research programme and the competitiveness and innovation programmes.
However, the Council's report does not contain any possible approaches to resolving those conflicts and issues.
However, the EAW should be complemented with effective instruments for protecting defendants, with the presence of a lawyer and the right to translation, which Baroness Ludford has already tackled in her report, but also, and very crucially, the assessment of detention conditions in European prisons.
However, the ECR does not support the capping of payments to large farms or proposals to extend market intervention to other sectors.
However, the EU legislator seems to have intended that the concept of domestic servants be interpreted narrowly, so not all domestic servants under the Convention are excluded from the scope of the EU health and safety at work acquis.
However, the EU-Canada economic relationship has not yet reached its full potential and I feel that an EU-Canada free trade agreement can strongly contribute to developing and realising this by improving trade and investment flows while removing tariff peaks and unjustified non-tariff barriers and supporting closer cooperation, particularly in the fields of regulatory cooperation, labour mobility and recognition of qualifications. I welcome an agreement with Canada going beyond the WTO commitments and being complementary to multilateral rules, provided that the negotiations produce a balanced, ambitious, high-quality agreement that goes well beyond tariff reductions, and other tools begin to be applied.
However, the Euratom Treaty is primary law and, therefore, is not the concern of the Commission but of the Member States. A change to the Euratom Treaty requires unanimity. I can only say to anyone who has good proposals to make on this subject: do you really believe, given the variety of opinions and moods and the supporters and opponents of nuclear power, that we would be likely to achieve unanimity about the continuation of the Euratom Treaty? I do not believe that it is very likely.
However, the European Fisheries Fund must continue to support this sector in order to reduce fishermen's dependency on fossil fuels, to make its activity more efficient and provide it with innovative proposals that must give new opportunities to the maritime sector.
However, the European Parliament should be informed about the additional measures to be taken in the area between Bulgaria, Turkey and Greece in order to address a possible increase in immigration flows.
However, the European Union does not have a presence in Iraq or, to be precise, our diplomats there are so few that they are invisible or unable to make themselves visible.
However, the European leaders at that time demonstrated courage and farsightedness even when Bulgaria and Romania were not members of the European Union.
However, the German constitution does permit this, while also allowing a case to be taken to the German constitutional court in such questions.
However, the Parliament here in Strasbourg cannot control matters which fall within the remit of the nation states.
However, the Stalinist regime's genocide in occupied Eastern European countries, as well as in Russia itself, are still, in some modern political circles, considered to be a theme best not discussed, and even the European Union has not completely evaluated this issue.
However, the Westminster Government is looking into rolling out HGV charges in accordance with European law by 2015.
However, the agreement still needs to be improved as registration by actors is still on a voluntary basis, although a pre-requisite for obtaining access to the institutions.
However, the amount spent on research and development should not in any way reduce future budgetary plans for the European Union's current priorities, such as the common agricultural policy or cohesion policy, because they are fulfilling their role well.
However, the arbitrary creation of new projects and organisations to facilitate these goals runs counter to the budgetary realities evident across the EU.
However, the assessment of its activities has been positive.
However, the big challenge - which is addressed in this resolution - is how to convert warm words into useful deeds without just throwing money at SMEs - money that is not available in today's economy.
However, the binding nature of this system creates an additional administrative burden.
However, the choice made today strengthens the cooperation between the two parties, and promotes a partnership capable of developing sustainable fishing and of exploiting the resources of Seychelles in a balanced way.
However, the comprehensive economic and trade agreement should by no means diminish Europe's established and accepted certification parameters. I would like to believe that, as we approach the finish line, the European Commission will be up to the challenge of finding appropriate solutions to the remaining problems.
However, the content of this agreement is nothing new: the opening up of markets, and the liberalisation of services, including increasingly commercialised public services, which are at the mercy of the interests of multinationals, and cause trouble for the people.
However, the crisis has demonstrated the dangers created by the current system: the lack of competition and a lack of accountability and transparency of agencies in particular.
However, the crux of the matter - and probably the stumbling block - will be agreeing a figure that tallies with the policies described in the report.
However, the debate has only just become public, with the result that some Members do not yet feel they have been adequately informed. I will be happy to provide assistance with such discussions or requests for information. I consider the project to be necessary and useful, because people need to find out more about European development - otherwise there will be more and more Eurosceptics.
However, the decision which was so greatly expected has still not been forthcoming. I believe that the motive for this is completely political.
However, the decisions by the European Union have not only failed to convince the markets; in some cases, they have exacerbated the situation, such as the famous Deauville decision on the involvement of private individuals in the permanent support mechanism to be created in 2013.
However, the definition and provision of descriptive indicators and statistics that allow the development of economic and environmental factors to be monitored, along with possible interactions between these factors, is unquestionably a useful tool for supporting strategic planning, defining public policy and outlining ways towards sustainable development.
However, the development of a common framework of shared goals and values, including shared entitlements and structures, is more than recommended.
However, the directives proposed by the report also have problematic aspects that should not be underestimated.
However, the divergent European votes on Resolution 1973 of the United Nations Security Council highlight the enormous difficulties - I stress, enormous difficulties - involved in achieving an effective common security and defence policy.
However, the effects at international level are also worrying, because they will create a waiver in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), in a key sector for many developing countries.
However, the evaluation committee invited Bulgaria to adopt additional measures, including a special plan that includes measures to be applied at the moment of entry to the Schengen area, largely because they fear migration flows from Turkey.
However, the fact is that cities and their entire infrastructure are built by people.
However, the fact that this satellite navigation system has been set up in competition with the Global Positioning System (GPS) of the United States, on which the EU depends, and which is well known to be under military control, with financing from US federal military programmes, is worrying.
However, the fact that we do not have the Council's agreement in the dialogue on economic policy and that the European Parliament and the two sides of industry are involved in this is reducing our ability to become more integrated.
However, the framework for the proper functioning of the state is problematic.
However, the identity of the members of these advisory bodies, which meet behind closed doors, remains a closely guarded secret.
However, the issue that is still causing me concern is whether we really will obtain access to the Indian market for our enterprises.
However, the levying of this charge will remain a reality and will bring an increase in the existing costs for the outlying countries of the EU. These new provisions of the Eurovignette Directive will allow Member States to charge heavy goods vehicles an amount equal to the cost of noise and air pollution caused by traffic, in addition to the infrastructure charge, at the tolls.
However, the low allocation threshold of revenue to the trans-European transport networks (TENs) (15%) is regrettable.
However, the mid-term review revealed several areas that need to be developed.
However, the outcome of the parliamentary procedures and especially of the trialogues with the Council has provided us with a text that I personally consider unsatisfactory; sensitive parts and some important aspects of the text submitted by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have been removed by the Council, and overall the final text shows signs of a struggle between different basic approaches to the issue.
However, the package of measures being voted on today wrongly reflects the tendency of the current centre-right majority to view governance as a mere austerity exercise, by strengthening the preventive and corrective dimension of the Stability and Growth Pact without outlining mechanisms and instruments for supporting investment and development.
However, the position followed by the Commission in this file shall not be considered as a precedent.
However, the potential for economic cooperation is far from exhausted and I welcome the negotiations in relation to the CETA.
However, the problems that affect them, including poverty and social exclusion, unemployment, housing shortages, crime and drug consumption, are huge and require careful attention.
However, the proposal does not provide for a reduction as drastic as was initially envisaged on account of the delay in implementing new technological solutions and the decline of more than 20% in turnover in 2009 and 2010. I voted for the rapporteur's recommendations because I agree, not only that this directive will enable tractor sellers to respect European legislation whilst overcoming the current crisis, but that it will enable farmers to replace used tractors with new agricultural machines with engines that are more efficient and that cause less pollution.
However, the quantity of steel, aluminium and copper needed in Europe and in the rest of the world should, as far as possible, be manufactured here in Europe, at least if it is currently produced here.
However, the questions raised and my previous question to the Commission about the very high cost of this particular endeavour have remained unanswered.
However, the reality in this and in other sectors which have seen increased liberalisation, such as rail transport, belies these promises of benefits.
However, the recent financial crisis has highlighted that there are three key problems in the industry: lack of competition, over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings by CRAs.
However, the recent past has demonstrated that, no matter the advantages this provides, the system has its drawbacks, too.
However, the report does not then make the correct inferences, limiting itself to questions of ethics in the behaviour of some people involved in the financial institutions and markets, as well as to creating a governance system which is effective and adequate in terms of risk management, compliance with regulations, and so on.
However, the report fundamentally emphasises the role of vocational training in promoting entrepreneurship and the need to 'create an environment where enterprises can succeed, develop and grow', adding that 'to grow, they need a reduced tax burden and predictability so they can plan and make investments'. It also believes that vocational training and lifelong learning must be geared more closely 'to the needs of the labour market and allow for entry into and mobility within it'. In other words, what the report does is put education and training fully at the beck and call of European capitalism.
However, the report includes a number of contradictions because it is founded on neoliberal ideas, defending the Internal Market and advocating EU patents, with which we disagree.
However, the report rightly highlights the belated completion of strategic and operational programmes, due to the difficult negotiating procedures; however, it also mentions - and this is an important point for Greece - that the EU needs to find ways of dealing with these delays when they arise due to scarce public resources available for cofinancing projects.
However, the report submitted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety relating to the Green Paper on forest protection and information introduces a rising tide of regulation, without acknowledging the importance of the forests as a job creator and an economic engine.
However, the repressive measures carried out by the Assad regime are intensifying and have already resulted, based on the figures supplied by the NGOs, in the murder of 600-700 civilians and the arrest or disappearance of another 8 000 people.
However, the resulting simplification of the processes will help to promote innovation within the industry.
However, the situation in Abyei must not make us forget the situation in Darfur.
However, the solution is primarily in the hands of the latter, as only they can reorganise and reform the national education systems and adjust them to the new socio-economic realities.
However, the stress tests that we are discussing were referred to as follows by the European Council on 24 and 25 March. I will read it in English, because that is the document I have.
However, the study by the Commission will not be carried out until 2013.
However, the task of this special committee was to find out how much money we need in order to be able to deal appropriately with the new political challenges faced.
However, the time when the West could assert its own interests without taking into consideration its partner nations and their people is long since past.
However, the urban dimension has up until now received insufficient recognition.
However, the values that Europe embodies - solidarity, tolerance, openness towards others, respect for minorities, respect for human rights and human dignity - have never been more deserving of support than in these times of globalisation, when the balance of power too often takes precedence over everything else. I am certain that if the people of Europe so wish, and if the Union overcomes division and populism, we will emerge stronger from the difficult times we are currently experiencing. I hope that the Heads of State or Government will promote this vision over any other view.
However, the version that was signed largely meets the expectations of the citizens, who are legitimately concerned about high levels of safety in Europe. I would like to explain once again, Mr Turmes, that if I had not signed the revised and, in my opinion, positive version of the test criteria, we would now have nothing.
However, the vision that has prevailed in the end is a right-wing vision in which protection of private investors is given priority over these objectives based on the general interest.
However, the way the mandate has been used has also led, as we have all said, to abuses and abusive practices: abusive practices when it is used for petty crime, and here I am not talking about the myriad farcical instances of thefts of bicycles, piglets and the like, and rather more serious abusive practices when there are disproportionate detentions, when innocent people are jailed and when the right to appeal these decisions is abused.
However, the way to overcome the objections and to pave the way for the acceptance and efficacy of the framework of the Eurovignette is to ensure, firstly, that the directive is applied strictly, transparently and quickly to all the Member States and, secondly, that all the revenue is channelled, as contributory resources, to transport infrastructures and is not used to plug well-publicised gaps.
However, their services are essential to our society, from infancy to help for elderly people.
However, there are also two clear and important 'no's'. 'No' to any splitting of this policy in different sectors and, finally, 'no' to the imposition of sanctions in connection with the Stability and Growth Pact.
However, there are imperfections in the functioning of the system: there is a possibility that its reputation and effectiveness may be undermined by news of its use for interrogations instead of charges and prosecutions in cases of petty crime.
However, there are indeed some reasons for concern, such as the shortcomings the Court has found with regard to procurement procedures, ex-ante checks of the European Commission's delegations and failing internal control systems in our partner countries.
However, there are new shortages of natural resources.
However, there are some concerns which the Commission needs to take into account: the environmental impact of extracting oil from tar sands and the health of workers mining asbestos are just two issues which need to be looked at carefully. I support calls for Canada to withdraw its WTO challenge on the EU's ban on seal products and am pleased that amendments outlining this position were adopted by Parliament.
However, there are some fundamental questions that are inescapable. I do not intend to repeat what has been said about the need to predict the consequences in the bilateral area, or about the fact that we should avoid the mistake of first defining free trade priorities and then moulding European industrial policy to these as a dependent variable, or that the question of making a contribution to sustainability must be taken into consideration.
However, there are still a few things that need to be taken into consideration and discussed.
However, there are still practical obstacles to mobility, especially for obtaining visas and medical papers in different languages, for transferring grants abroad, and for the recognition of qualifications gained in another Member State.
However, there are very many domains which can contribute to synergies or economies of scale: the European External Action Service, humanitarian aid and civil protection, pooling of resources in defence, research and innovation, major infrastructure projects (especially in the areas of energy and transport).
However, there is a lack of funds for the development of enterprise and technical and social infrastructure in rural areas, and this should be the role of cohesion policy.
However, there is a need for the European Commission to then take specific actions to respond positively to these problems.
However, there is a nice link that connects the two issues, because in relation to the migration issue, in particular Schengen, we also see the same principle at work, namely that one of Europe's major successes is now being called into question as a result of national egotism. I am sure that we have all seen the figures indicating that 18 000 refugees have arrived in Italy.
However, there is another aspect of the resolution with which we agree, specifically, the criticism of the lack of transparency with regard to the composition and work of the Commission's internal advisory committee on public procurement (ACPP) and the role and competences of the Advisory Committee on the Opening-Up of Public Procurement (CCO). We also support the call for the Commission to take steps to ensure that the composition of both this committee and the planned new advisory committee on public/private partnerships is balanced, including trade unionists and representatives of the business community, in particular, SMEs, and that they work in a transparent manner.
However, there is no need to be too rigid or extreme; incentives for the Member States are a good idea, too.
However, there is often a big gap between theory and reality, despite Parliament having been the first EU institution to deal with the phenomenon of the growing number of interest groups at European level and, in particular, with the consequences of this development for the legislative process.
However, there is room to develop a European framework with common coordination denominators, common objectives and values and common rights and structures.
However, there is still a need to create real Member State responsibility with regard to their role in the shared management of Union cohesion funds, whilst it remains essential to introduce a system for analysing the viability of data submitted by national agencies and a mandatory national management declarations system.
However, there is, in actual fact, a conflict between the World Health Organisation and the International Atomic Energy Agency, with the interests of the nuclear industry seeming to take priority over human health.
However, there should be no option for extending its use after this date.
However, there were different reactions to the details of this new vision.
However, these efforts must be significantly improved, given that Croatia continues to be one of the main routes for drug trafficking into the EU.
However, these people must also be imprisoned.
However, these solutions will not be worth very much if we do not at the same time support those European banks that are still not able to stand on their own feet.
However, these workers do deserve special protection. I am therefore in favour of adopting the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Convention, but I do not think it would be sensible to incorporate large parts of the convention into EU law.
However, they can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator's democratic and legitimate decision-making process.
However, they can in no way be a substitute for political debate and the legislator's democratically legitimate decision-making process.
However, they can in no way be a substitute for the legislator's democratically legitimated decision-making process.
However, they must not just be promoted prior to a piece of legislation (ex ante), but also following its adoption (ex post). IAs must be independent and undertaken in a transparent and objective way.
However, this aspiration and potential are restricted by financial, bureaucratic and other kinds of obstacles. I fully support the report on the Innovation Union because I think that it will allow us to knock down the barriers preventing innovative thinking in the European Union.
However, this cannot be a pretext for putting the textile industry of several Member States, such as Portugal, at risk.
However, this clearly is not the case, because certain rights are interpreted differently from one Member State to another, such as the right to silence, or simply because certain procedures differ, such as the period of detention on remand.
However, this crisis has highlighted that the European system is not infallible and that we are extremely vulnerable.
However, this freedom sometimes raises issues that need to be cleared up and, above all, prepared for or prevented.
However, this important approach is liable, in many cases, to be frustrated by the considerable autonomy and strong competition existing between the various authorities in charge of managing each monofund programme.
However, this initiative needs to be combined with the report entitled 'An EU strategy for Youth', which was adopted by the European Parliament in 2010 and which seeks to set out a new, strong, European strategy for the next ten years, so that, when it comes to youth issues, Europe can develop a single policy framework.
However, this instrument must be intelligently designed, and must be such that it improves the current situation without leading to further waste of resources.
However, this is about segregation based on ethnic criteria, reducing the influence and undermining the authority of a state within its borders in favour of another neighbouring state, about breaking up territories belonging to one European Union Member State and annexing them to another Member State of the same European Union.
However, this is not reflected in the European Parliament amendments, and as a result of the consultation with WTO members, it might be necessary to subject a few more products to tariff rate quotas.
However, this may not be at the expense of rank-and-file workers in the Commission, as was suggested in Paragraph 81. I do not accept that workers should be forced to work longer as a result of cuts, regardless of who their employer is. Workers' rights should be guaranteed and defended.
However, this must not result in those countries and those farmers which already have very ambitious environmental programmes in the second pillar being discriminated against by this new approach. A solution needs to be found here that is fair to both sides.
However, this proposal will have to be amended during tomorrow's vote so as to ensure that the data collected are reliable and conducive to debate, and also, and above all, to ensure that all the Member States are involved in this approach.
However, this report has enabled us to verify that measures that can be taken within the framework of international trade probably cannot be dealt with as urgently as these acts require, so we should learn for the future.
However, this sector raises a number of issues which need to be clarified.
However, this should not distract us from dealing with the real problem of how best to cope with the migration of genuine asylum seekers from North Africa, who are or will be fleeing from war-torn countries.
However, this stage of learning has been minimally studied, and little importance has been attached to it in the context of education overall.
However, this suggested increase means that the next Multiannual Financial Framework (financial perspectives) 2014-2020 would represent just 1.11% of EU gross national income (GNI), as opposed to 1.06%, the sum projected for 2013.
However, this will not come about unless the Union and the Member States set out clear priorities, thus preventing the dispersal of funds and emphasising aspects whose pursuit is genuinely essential.
However, this year, the Union will be able to take advantage of its new 'super-observer' status, which confers special rights to speak during sessions. I voted in favour of this resolution because it is commensurate with the Union's new ambitions at international level.
However, those of us who are familiar with the Europol report OCTA 2011 on the subject of organised crime will be asking ourselves whether the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs is deaf and blind, and why on earth we indulge ourselves in Europol at all if we simply ignore its warnings.
However, three years after the conflict with Georgia, Russia is still not respecting the agreements of 12 August and 8 September 2008 relating to the withdrawal of its forces from the occupied Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, and does not provide the European Union Monitoring Mission with free and total access to its territories.
However, to achieve this we need strong EU delegations, delegations which can assume those roles and tasks and ensure the quality of spending.
However, to be fully useful and effective, this will have to be followed by the genuine introduction of a new range of indicators as well as their effective and coherent political use, so that they are not turned into gimmicks but, well and truly, into genuine tools that help with decision making.
However, to claim, in this situation, that the cause is known, without having well-founded laboratory research to back it up, is negligent in the extreme.
However, to ensure that everything we think in this Chamber and all the European projects have a connection to Europe's population and each European citizen, and that all these projects have a future, the youth of today must believe in the European Union project, they must feel increasingly European and we must significantly increase our investments in culture, education and in youth projects and programmes.
However, to limit the duration even further to one year would erode the advantages of the autonomous trade preferences measure, and they would become meaningless.
However, together we should concentrate on the fact that the enemy is not in Spain or in Germany, but rather the real problem is the pathogen that we need to get under control and to combat.
However, trying to use common trade policy to express this solidarity might have undesirable repercussions for the future, both in this specific case and in others that could arise.
However, unfortunately, that approach is still unfeasible at this stage...
However, we all agree that spectrum is a very valuable resource and we need to recognise that talking about a digital single market also gives us the opportunity and the responsibility to think along cross-border lines - and, if there is one area in which we ought to think cross-border, it is spectrum policy.
However, we all know that, for Italy, 18 000 refugees is hardly an excessive burden, because twice as many refugees have been received in the last year in Belgium alone.
However, we also consider it important to mention that the current legal basis does not provide sufficient European solutions, because we do not have co-decision rights.
However, we also need to improve the business skills of our creative artists and to give them a sound media grounding in new technologies.
However, we also voted for it to return to the Commission, in the hope that it is still possible to take into account the position of the Portuguese Parliament, which adopted a resolution against these trade concessions.
However, we are also aware that in Brussels, for example, we are surrounded by more than 10 000 professional lobbyists, who do exactly what their job description suggests, namely attempting to exert influence on Members of Parliament and the Commission.
However, we are also producing a cultural landscape that can be seen, that provides recreational spaces for you all, for all of us, for our society, that provides jobs not just in agriculture but also in tourism and in many other areas.
However, we are aware that there will be developments in the fields of research and science.
However, we are concerned about some aspects, not least the principles guiding the European Research Area, since it should be focused on cooperation between genuine research and collaboration networks, reversing any trends towards concentration of scientific and human resources in the more developed countries and mitigating the currently existing inequalities in national research systems.
However, we are deeply concerned about the fact that we have passed the authority to set priorities over to the Council.
However, we are not really becoming sufficiently involved.
However, we are, of course, awaiting the Green Paper which the Commissioner has just mentioned with great interest.
However, we came to the view that we needed to look a little more into what was behind this case.
However, we cannot fail to point out some doubts that remain - arising from other fisheries partnership agreements - about the effectiveness of the stated objectives of cooperation on sustainable development in the sector for the third country in question, and on the sustainability and monitoring of their fishing activities.
However, we cannot forget that the area in question is one of the most sensitive parts of the EU's external borders in terms of illegal migration.
However, we cannot invent new criteria for joining the Schengen area and we cannot undermine the certainty that a state is part of that area as soon as current criteria are met.
However, we chose to reject the report (which was approved by 345 to 246 votes).
However, we currently risk being accused of protecting the leading figures from the previous government with a European political 'screen', including former Prime Minister Tymoshenko personally.
However, we do think that there is a need for a fundamental appraisal of cohesion policy going forward because, as more and more regions go above the 75% threshold, the policy is either going to become redundant or be reformed, and that is what we expect to happen.
However, we have also worked jointly to remove them again once the objective has been achieved.
However, we have not always been entirely successful in doing this in this report, which also explains why some of my fellow Members will be pressing the 'no' button, or perhaps the 'abstain' button, in tomorrow's vote, even though a large majority of our group supports the report.
However, we have now taken an important step forwards and we need to push on even further.
However, we have seen too many good intentions that have never improved life for working farmers.
However, we hope that they will be taken seriously if we want the Innovation Union programme to be one of the successes of the Europe 2020 strategy.
However, we in the European Parliament, together with the High Representative, need to ask a quite different question.
However, we just as surely need the Member States to give higher priority to this matter. I think the fact that the Member States are failing in their responsibility to check their compliance with EU legislation is a constantly recurring issue.
However, we know perfectly well that it is going to default anyway, so it has a choice of defaulting within the euro which merely kicks the problem down the road and it will return to bite us, or it can default outside the euro, in which case it can solve its problem.
However, we must be mindful of encroaching too much on European citizens as there are obvious personal privacy issues with such technology.
However, we must be totally realistic and propose specific working instruments which will allow the correlation of innovation efforts at European, national and regional level.
However, we must give Greece time to privatise those things that it is sensible to do so at a point in time when it will receive an adequate amount of money for them.
However, we must not fall into the trap of triumphalism and think that from now on, the EU will present a uniform standpoint in the forum of the United Nations.
However, we must not forget that exiting the crisis also has European aspects: the economic development plan; financial market regulations to prevent this crisis from recurring; the measures currently being discussed on economic governance in the European Union; EU measures which only make national measures more efficient.
However, we must not forget the need to ensure that domestic jobs - not all of which should be regarded as precarious and undervalued or underpaid - are indeed decent jobs.
However, we must remain realistic.
However, we must remember that transport firms, particularly during a crisis, will not be able to afford to change their fleets quickly and buy vehicles which comply with the Euro V and VI standards.
However, we must warn Russia, at the highest level, that it is unacceptable to strengthen influence in a neighbouring country by exploiting a situation and negotiating with an authoritarian regime that does not represent the people.
However, we need a strong common agricultural policy and strong agricultural assistance to achieve this goal. I therefore consider it important that pursuant to the report, the agricultural budget be maintained at least at the same level as in 2013 in the next EU financing period.
However, we need a three-pronged approach involving leading, pooling and sharing.
However, we need to do more work, we need to ensure that the transparency and integrity of the work of lobbyists at the EU level is of the highest.
However, we only need to look at the heated discussions around the reversed qualified majority voting system to see how far we still have to go, when it is rules and automatic sanctions we should be talking about.
However, we see that we are being blamed for things which go beyond our responsibilities.
However, we should bear in mind the fact that, even if we use ex ante and ex post control mechanisms to assess the impact of third-country imports on the European market, the European Union has not yet been able to adopt a control mechanism based on fair and important information for consumers such as that provided by origin marking. I hope that the Council, too, will quickly come to a positive conclusion on the decisive steps taken by this House towards ensuring traceability and adequate information on products.
However, we should not only focus on sustainable development but also consider the extraction of resources which pose a risk to life and health such as asbestos, the use and extraction of which is banned in Europe.
However, we still have a lot to do to make life easier for SMEs with respect to the red tape they are faced with and access to funding that is often difficult.
However, we will also need public participation across national borders.
However, we will continue to advocate the maintenance of a system of milk-production quotas as an essential condition for defending producers in the countries that are more sensitive, the maintenance of planting rights in the wine sector, and the maintenance of subsidies for potable alcohol distillation and crisis distillation.
However, we would do well to discuss these issues with a clearer idea of how much this new policy will cost, what effects it will have on general cohesion policy, and how we are going to distribute the resources in the context of the reform of the financial perspective from here to 2020.
However, we would like to point out that we do not believe it to be necessary to continue to provide EU support for the school fruit programme and the aid for deprived persons programme, as we believe that it is better for the measures that these programmes entail to be taken at national level.
However, what is the situation in Pakistan at the moment? Although Bin Laden is out of the equation, the question that has arisen in recent days as to the extent to which representatives of the Pakistani Government were aware of who was hiding in their country remains.
However, what needs to be done above all is for the European Parliament to stake its claim to competence to decide on the issue alongside the Council. I would therefore remind you that the proposal that the procedure invoke the legal basis of Article 70, which excludes Parliament, is unacceptable: we demand Article 77.
However, what the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and my predecessor, Mrs Joly, have now presented is something that we are able to accept and also support.
However, what this tool was never intended for was to investigate and punish petty crimes such as the theft of a pig, stealing a chocolate bar or exceeding a bank overdraft limit.
However, what we in the Committee on Regional Development are calling for is for this single framework and coordination not to be confined to the policy planning stage but to be extended to cover all policy-making stages: planning, implementation and payments, auditing and evaluation.
However, when I look at how the political will has been lacking, how the corporate interests have interfered and how the WTO has procrastinated, what I see before us are recommendations that dilute the original proposals put forward at such short notice by the Commission.
However, when it comes to generating European added value, as we have done in many areas, we need to work together to develop this because, when they go it alone, the national states are weaker in the face of international competition.
However, when something is good it is not necessarily enough.
However, when the EU calls for key data from the Member States, it should not baulk at sensitive issues. I am thinking here of nuclear policy, genetic engineering, adequate origin labelling of foodstuffs and, not least, an investigation with regard to the recent EHEC cucumber scandal.
However, when we talk about a 'gentlemen's agreement' between the Council and Parliament, I have to say that, if there is such an agreement, please can we see it. The Council has the chance to read it out today, if such an agreement exists.
However, while listening to you, I wondered if I should actually speak. I must complement you: I think Parliament has reason to be proud of the action by the whole of the European Union and of the way in which this Sudanese affair has been conducted, and like the Sudanese people, I am keeping my fingers firmly crossed that this will continue into independence and beyond.
However, while we are essentially appealing to the Member States to construct this role of the Union, we are also appealing to your commitment to put your capacity for political initiative and your services to work in order to raise the level of the European Union's external representation and rationalise it.
However, with regard to justice, the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament also has a responsibility towards Mr Papandreou and his government.
However, with regard to this matter, we must always take into account the performance level that we want to see in the future, on the one hand, for the first generation network and, on the other, for the cable operators and everyone else with an interest in the spectrum, particularly the blue light organisations.
However, worryingly, concern was expressed over the findings of the Court of Auditors as regards the lack of transparency in recruitment procedures and the intervention of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), which has opened an inquiry (OF/2009/0370). All deficiencies must be overcome in order to achieve greater transparency and to eliminate any uncertainty concerning the work of the European Training Foundation.
However, you can only ever be as effective as the Member States will allow you to be and, of course, you are reluctant to use your own powers of initiative - an approach which I fully support.
However, you must know that I need the approval of the European Commission - which I already have - and the national regulators - which I intend to obtain. I need to get approval for the test criteria of the stress tests from each national regulator, including our very competent and esteemed colleagues in Paris, London, Madrid and Brussels, where opinion is still inconclusive, although there is a feeling that there is little to be gained by taking matters to a European level.
Howver, I realise that there are still questions to be answered, since the Council of Ministers represents the states. I am, however, confident that we will come to a positive conclusion.
Huge importance is attached to a pragmatic system of internships which will allow everyone to earn a decent wage and access social insurance, so that they do not replace real jobs.
Human rights and democracy are cornerstones in our cooperation with Azerbaijan under the existing partnership and cooperation agreement.
Human rights should be respected, and cultural arguments can never be used to justify violations of human rights. I would recommend that colleagues read the report. I think that this debate shows that we need many more discussions on culture in the EU.
Human rights, democracy, this hard core: this is what we must promote more vigorously in European foreign policy, instead of looking at things purely from the perspective of the economy.
Humanitarian principles and the desire for global balance provide plausible grounds for this.
Hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives, and many bear the consequences of the radiation to this day in the form of disease and death through cancer. I am delighted that the European Parliament is addressing the question of nuclear safety today and that this is a key point, but another key point is that without nuclear energy we cannot, unfortunately, get by at all.
Hungarian civil society and the Venice Commission have expressed serious concerns regarding the duration and transparency of the process.
Hungarians also have the right to adopt a constitution which makes no mention of an ombudsman or a personal data representative.
Hungary is maintaining all her international legal obligations and commitments and, in fact, this is clearly stated in the text of the constitution, and if it were not the case, then the Commission would take it to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg to challenge it in a formal procedure; but we all know in this Chamber that this is not the case.
Hungary, Latvia, Romania, outside the euro area, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom and Greece too, apart from a break of four years, when our lot were in. In other words, your economic model does not work.
Hungary, which was the first country in the world to be the subject of a coordinated action to resettle its refugees in 1956, has very particular responsibilities - historical responsibilities - to act on this refugee crisis as well.
I abstained from the vote because I have doubts about the long-term impact that the directives proposed in the report will have on the Member States' national economies.
I abstained from this vote. I supported the accompanying Ferreira report, but was unable to support this report as I strongly oppose the programme of crippling austerity measures which is being driven through the European Union by the centre-right.
I abstained in the vote, as I believe that there has been no discussion of how to bring about mutual recognition of qualifications obtained through qualitatively differing methods of education and training.
I abstained on the Eurovignette vote today. I abstained because, in the case of Catalonia, what is proposed would penalise a lot of small and medium enterprises that do not have the option of putting goods and products on trains - in particular, because of the difference of gauge, which constitutes a physical barrier to completion of the Internal Market - and would damage their business greatly.
I abstained when voting on this report, despite the critical look it takes at European policies, particularly those carried out by the Member States, aimed at young people.
I addressed the question of the functional overlap between two agencies - the ETF and Cedefop - in my introductory speech, but I would like to stress again that the contribution of these agencies can be crucial, especially in the context of increasing employment in line with the 2020 objectives.
I admit that the Commission has acted swiftly and effectively by proposing a package of measures, which obviously needed to be discussed and rebalanced so that they did not penalise a European sector that has already been tested by the crisis.
I advocate that we continue along this path. I believe that Parliament can make a great contribution towards raising the Commission to another level. I wish Mr Fjellner all the best and would like to extend my warm thanks to my parliamentary staff, particularly Bent Adamsen and Dominykas Mordas.
I agree about the terrible violence in Syria. I am not in any way lacking in ambition for what we should do with Syria.
I agree that we should never forget the Chernobyl disaster.
I agree with Mario Monti, who said that excessive deference to large Member States contributed somewhat to the current economic crisis, and our proposals might at least stop that happening in the future. I just hope it is not a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.
I agree with all the points made by the report: it is important that the Member States and the Union should shoulder responsibility for measures to support children's early learning, but they must claim a role that cannot be solely delegated to parents, or to those who work in the education sector.
I agree with all those parliamentarians who have underlined the problem of prison conditions in Europe. I would like to tell them that next week, the Commission will adopt a Green Paper on detention.
I agree with extending the scope of the proposal for a regulation on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro area Member States to the territory of Member States that are about to introduce the euro.
I agree with the European Parliament's call for the Commission to draft a European handbook on multi-level governance and encourage the Member States to follow it, taking into account specific local and regional objectives, to extend the application of cohesion policy governance measures (that is, programming, funding and implementation on the basis of national, regional and local partnership) and to apply them to funds that will be included in the planned common strategic framework, in order to ensure greater public expenditure efficiency.
I agree with the amendments to the proposal initially tabled by the Commission, which were supported by a broad majority in the European Parliament. I would argue that it is important to take into account the experience acquired during the years when the old SGP existed, along with the fact that economic governance has become more democratic through the European Parliament's involvement throughout the entire surveillance process. I therefore voted for this report.
I agree with the main political message of the preliminary report, which maintains that the EU budget has a crucial role to play in helping the Member States recover from the economic and social crisis, in the sense of promoting growth and jobs.
I agree with the measures and good practice proposed by Mr Mikolášik, and I believe that the proposal for broader application of core indicators is a particularly useful one, as is the preparation of reports on the results and synergies between national policies and European Union policies.
I agree with the perspective which was adopted by the G8. I think it is in our common interest to have not only open societies but open economies.
I agree with the rapporteur that overall responsibility for the ENPI should be returned to the Regional Development DG and that the cross-border cooperation programmes should be implemented in a framework similar to that for the Interreg programmes.
I agree with the report that Member States should make use of the structural funds to support research, development and innovation (R&D&I) objectives that target social challenges, with the aim of increasing prosperity in Europe.
I agree with what Mr Daul said about neighbourhood terrorism and the Middle East peace process as being some of the key objectives that we have in terms of the work we do this year.
I agree with you that the technical side of the story has worked.
I agreed with this document because the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009, extended the circumstances in which Parliament's consent was required for the conclusion of an international agreement.
I also accept that Russia has economic interests in the former Soviet republics, some of which are now - thankfully - gravitating away from Moscow towards the EU. However, the EU should continue to insist that it will support and engage with these now-independent countries such as Ukraine, and make sure that the door is left open to them in terms of Euro-Atlantic aspirations.
I also agree with Mr De Gucht. I am very pleased that he is supporting the proposal negotiated by the committee, because it really is a very good compromise between various standpoints: a compromise between the Commission's standpoint, on the one hand, and the opinions presented by the Member States, and, on the other, it is compatible with investors' interests, but most of all, it opens up good prospects for the Union's investment policy in the future, serving the Union as a whole.
I also appeal from this Chamber to the football authorities in Romania to reverse this decision and allow Politehnica Timişoara to remain in top-flight Romanian and European football.
I also believe that a new International Labour Organisation convention and recommendation could be of significant help and should be adopted, if possible, at the 100th International Labour conference.
I also believe that it is very important to improve the efficiency of the EU's administrative expenditure, and one way of doing this is to increase the transparency of the process for distributing and using this expenditure.
I also consider it very important to support lifelong learning and activities that are not just for young people. I would definitely like to emphasise equal opportunities for all, not only in terms of gender equality, but also for disabled or otherwise disadvantaged people.
I also fully concur with the need to ensure coherence and complementarity between the various instruments which currently exist for supporting research, development and innovation.
I also have to say that at this time, in the wake of the Fukushima accident, our work has been extremely difficult and I am pleased that, despite these difficult times, the text adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) has been prepared to an adequate standard and that we did not get carried away with ideological debates.
I also highly appreciate the outstanding role played by State Secretary András Kármán, who represented the Hungarian Presidency with such skill and determination.
I also hope that you will soon argue the case with the agriculture ministers for an emergency fund, to be paid for from the surplus still available in the agriculture budget.
I also regret that India has been less than supportive in the WTO but I hope, as Mr Rinaldi mentioned, that the so-called cricket diplomacy is going to lead to a solution and that India will recognise that, both on humanitarian grounds and in the interests of security, it is important to help Pakistan create jobs and investment in the future.
I also requested that the Commission should present a report to Parliament and the Council, no later than five years after this regulation enters into force, on the situation regarding re-examination of existing bilateral agreements, relating in particular to the number of bilateral agreements that the different Member States may have renegotiated.
I also see problems in the formulation of Section D. There is talk here of a single Hungarian nation, of collective rights, of support for their self-rule in other countries on the principle of ethnicity, on the responsibility of Hungary for all Hungarians.
I also sense that there is broad support - maybe not full but broad support - for Mrs Lagarde, who has already been endorsed by the EU Member States and by the Commission as their candidate for Managing Director of the IMF.
I also supported the raising of the retirement age for MEPs from 60 to 63. I feel that representatives enforcing a slashing of living standards for workers should at the very least accept that their privileges undergo the same treatment.
I also think it is vital that greater importance is attached to the development of research at regional level by encouraging multi-level partnerships and supporting the drafting of methodological guides or guidelines for this purpose.
I also think that the communication on this matter has been chaotic.
I also voted in favour because, although it should strengthen the planning and monitoring of budget processes, I agree that the EFSA needs to ensure that its advice is of a high quality and is independent, in order to guarantee compliance with Union safety standards, scientific excellence and independence on all matters with a direct or indirect impact on food and feed safety, and plant protection.
I also want to emphasise the importance of intellectual property rights (IPR), in particular, for actors.
I also want to mention Mr Stavrakakis and one of his reports about the Council. I am now addressing directly the President-in-Office of the Council, the Hungarian Presidency. I find it unbelievable that the Council, which has always demanded that others act transparently, has obviously been much more reserved when it comes to itself.
I also want to put a question to all the Members of this Parliament: can you say that this economic governance package is worse today than when it arrived here? Can you say that no improvements have been made to it by this House? You cannot say that, because it is not true.
I also want to say that I am very happy to support the amendments from the Green Group where they talk about the inclusion of au pairs and undeclared work, but come forward with practical suggestions to ensure we are proactive in ensuring access to the open labour market for domestic workers.
I also want to say that I do not consider a flotilla to be the right response to the humanitarian situation in Gaza. I have been there twice. I continue to highlight the plight of the people, especially asking for more access to enable the economy to start to develop.
I also wanted to draw your attention to what happened during the hearing with Mervyn King and Andrea Enria, whose very determined action we applaud.
I also wanted to make some reference to what Mr Bisky said when he talked about the poorest in the world: 'support life with dignity' was his expression. I think what we do with the Millennium Development Goals and the work that we are doing in collaboration in bringing development together is going to be so important for that in the future.
I also welcome the fact that the new protocol includes a suspension clause in case of human rights violations.
I also witnessed the major expectations of the people who decided on the liberation of their country from bondage.
I am also celebrating, Baroness Ashton, the fact that the European Union's voice in the United Nations General Assembly was finally strengthened in New York last week as the result of a vote that received widespread support. I congratulate you on that, given that last year's disaster raised worrying questions about the future role of the Union in the world and in international organisations.
I am also in agreement with many of the honourable Members that, after the hard work of negotiations, we have to get the deal done. I am optimistic because, here in this House, I feel a commitment and a real sense of ownership towards the future of Europe.
I am also pleased that we have been able to strengthen consumer rights and have included so-called door-to-door selling, because a lot of shady practices are to be found there.
I am appalled that the EU is seeking to implement a device to proffer national packages at Union level by majority voting, undermining the ability of individual Member States to gain or maintain advantages that may substantially support domestic economies. I would like to ask the Commission whether it actually recognises pacta sunt servanda in international law.
I am baffled by the emphasis placed on the need to increase the power and resources of common actions and the European Defence Agency: given the precedents, I would not like that, too, to become a useless bureaucratic machine that is an end in itself, and its actions to become totally ineffective.
I am calling for a little more flexibility for the Member States. I am also calling for the Commission to analyse my request thoroughly and to understand the concerns of an entire sector, which must be preserved and developed.
I am calling publicly on our High Representative, Catherine Ashton. I have already written to her to ask her to make every effort to intervene on behalf of those medics who simply did what medical personnel do - try to save lives.
I am certain that the European Qualifications Framework, the European system of academic units for vocational education and training, transparency and cooperation and comparability of the various education systems will support the needs ...
I am concerned about the ineptitude of our government, but the silence of the European institutions is also striking, as if they did not want to see this violation of European law by the country holding the Presidency.
I am concerned that the current budgetary constraints imposed on Member States may lead to greater restrictions on investment in research and innovation, with obvious negative effects on European growth and competitiveness. I therefore call on the Commission to consider leveraging the resources of the common strategic framework for funding these sectors, particularly the research and innovation sectors of the European Union.
I am concerned that, more than a year after the Treaty of Lisbon entered into effect, there are still no clear signs of a comprehensive EU approach to foreign and security policy, within the framework of which it would be possible to overcome the traditional procedural and institutional barriers restricting the EU's ability to act. I am concerned about the unwillingness of EU Member States to define a common position on the crisis in Libya, or on UN Security Council Resolution 1973 and how to implement it. Ideas about creating ad hoc coalitions of countries as possible substitutes for a common security and defence policy are dangerous, in my opinion, as no European state in the 21st century has a real chance of being a significant player in the area of security and defence. I would like to point out in this context that the Treaty of Lisbon provides the possibility of entrusting the implementation of crisis-resolution operations to a group of Member States, although only within the framework of a Council decision defining the objectives, scope and terms of their implementation. A common response to the developments in Libya is essential to the creation of a new and credible approach to the Neighbourhood Policy with southern countries.
I am confident that the objectives of both Parliament and the Council are the same, namely to strengthen the economic governance of the EU and the euro area, prevent future crises and build a stronger framework for economic governance in the euro area and the EU as a whole.
I am convinced that Georgia is an example to Caucasian region countries, and I have no fear in saying that this country can serve as an example to some EU Member States that currently lack the political courage to carry out reforms that would pave the way to growth and modernisation.
I am convinced that actions to promote the use of EGNOS and Galileo in civil aviation are crucial for implementation of the Single European Sky ATM Research programme.
I am convinced that the Commission should take steps to promote programmes among interested Europeans while catering for the needs of beneficiaries from new acceding countries.
I am convinced that the European Union needs harmonised guidelines which enable Member States to make charges for external costs created by the road transport sector.
I am convinced that the sustainable management of forests is essential if we are to maintain the capacity of the Union's forests to fulfil their economic, ecological and social functions.
I am delighted that my amendment, which 'takes note of the recent legal developments regarding the EU's ban on seal products, in particular, Canada's request to the WTO for the establishment of a formal dispute resolution panel, and expresses its strong hope that Canada will withdraw the WTO challenge, which runs counter to positive trade relations, prior to the need for ratification of the CETA agreement by the European Parliament', was carried.
I am delighted that the report voted today stipulates that impact assessments be carried out totally independently; that impact assessments take a larger range of criteria into account (socio-economic, environmental, etc.); and also that the highest transparency be guaranteed, especially where experts are involved.
I am delighted that this report has been adopted, since most of our ideas (climate, social cohesion, integrated and bottom-up approach, disadvantaged neighbourhoods, cross-funding and so on) are included.
I am delighted to learn that the new common agricultural policy will end the period of discrimination against farmers in certain Member States, including my own. I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work, which is clearly the work of an author who understands the issues involved. I am all the more alarmed by the attempt to establish new discriminatory conditions.
I am disappointed that this report has passed through Parliament. I was unable to support it because, as a response to a Commission Green Paper, it ruled out far too many options for the future of an EU contract law and neglected a duty to request an impact assessment on the full costs and implications of each of the Commission's options.
I am disappointed, however, that the Council has not signed up to the proposal.
I am encouraged by the approach of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy: realising that what counts, in addition to statements, are actions. I would like to remind you, Baroness Ashton, of Joseph Daul's advice: do not be afraid, and you will have the support of this Parliament.
I am encouraged to see also India making real headway in trying to deal with a variety of issues including particularly non-tariff barriers.
I am especially delighted that in this text, we called for abolition of the discriminations linked to age, regarding access to the social protection scheme. I am asking for it here and, of course, I think that the minimum income scheme is a key element in guaranteeing young people's autonomy.
I am familiar with the issues of pollution mentioned in this report and I take them very seriously, but additional charges for air and noise pollution are not the answer.
I am glad that the European Parliament has endorsed that proposal in Mr Dess's report.
I am glad the EP welcomes the peaceful and credible conduct of both Sudan and South Sudan in the 2011 Southern Sudan Referendum, the efforts by all parties to the CPA and the commitment they have demonstrated to it; views this as a crucial step in implementing the CPA and as a positive sign for the peaceful coexistence of both countries; reiterates its full respect for the outcome of the referendum as the expression of the democratic will of the people of South Sudan; calls on both North and South Sudan actively to pursue the promotion of democratic governance and the establishment of long-term peace, security and prosperity for both countries, with respect for human, social and economic rights; calls on the South Sudan authorities to promote the development of South Sudan as a modern, pluralistic, democratic state based on the rule of law and respecting human rights, in particular, women's and children's rights, and the primacy of the right of citizens to choose their government through regular free elections, with protection of freedom of movement, freedom of association and freedom to express one's political views enshrined in both constitution and law.
I am glad to hear in the discussion confirmation of the Commission's objectives in this exercise to bring the EGF into the next financial perspective as a stronger and more effective instrument to support workers who have been made redundant.
I am grateful for the interest you have shown in the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
I am grateful to Mr Mauro for that apt intervention ... (Mr Borghezio speaks without a microphone). I believe that the whole of this House shares the disappointment and the profound bitterness at the decisions that have been taken, and therefore I can only repeat what Parliament has already made clear on this issue on at least two occasions.
I am happy to say that the report we are presenting here today has emerged from extremely good cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs, Ms Trautmann, Mr Rohde, Mr Chichester and Mr Lamberts, who have supported the proposal. I am very grateful for this because we are discussing today a proposal that can enable Europe to recover the lead in mobile telephony, mobile Internet and modern information technology.
I am happy to see that this approach is high on the agenda of the ongoing discussions and the proposals which are on the table really match the Commission's ambitions.
I am in agreement with the Merkies report because I strongly believe that innovation and creativity are key to the economic recovery of the Union and that the importance of converting the Union's scientific technological breakthroughs into new goods and services cannot be overstated.
I am in favour of Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen area. A detailed and objective assessment of both countries' compliance with the Schengen acquis has been completed.
I am in favour of consenting to the European Union's participation in the Agreement on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Prespa Park Area entered into by Greece, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. I take this view because the park is a natural area of international importance, owing to its geomorphology, ecology, biodiversity and cultural significance. I also support the objectives and the principles outlined in the agreement, which are based on the sustainable use of natural resources, a focus on the conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity, and the prevention, control and reduction of water pollution in the Prespa Lakes.
I am in favour of opening an office of the kind you have described in Libya, because you as High Representative, the Union itself, and Parliament as an independent body, all have credibility in humanitarian and political terms.
I am in favour of repealing the Council regulation on proof of origin for certain textile products as I believe that efforts need to be made to simplify the existing legislation in order to create a clearer legislative environment for businesses. I should, however, add that I consider it important to maintain alternative controlling mechanisms for imports of such products into the EU, in order to avoid market disruption caused by increases in such imports.
I am in favour of the report because forests, which cover more than 42% of the EU's surface area, provide a livelihood for many workers and businesses in the forestry sector. A framework of Commission guidelines should be established; binding sustainability criteria should be introduced, including mandatory national forestry programmes; payment for ecosystem services should be formalised; and forest protection policies should be strengthened by reintroducing the fire prevention regulation.
I am in favour of this own-initiative report since it deals with promoting corporate social responsibility as a voluntary motivational tool designed to stimulate business growth.
I am inspired by the excellent speech made by Mrs Hübner, the chair of our committee, and by an excellent report from Mr Theurer on the lessons from absorption capacity. I would therefore like to ask you, Commissioner, from the European perspective of the future funding cycle, how Romania, the country with the lowest absorption rate, can commit to a so-called administrative reform which has nothing to do with the regional reform, without there being any impact study, without at least going through the motions of consultations with the Directorate General for Regional Policy, which found out about this project in the press, and without having consultations with political actors, local actors and civil society, thereby jeopardising the whole project's stability and predictability.
I am not questioning the strategic importance of these projects, but I cannot fail to highlight that they have been falling short of expectations. I agree that, as both Galileo and the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) are European programmes and are in the common public interest of the Union, they should, overall, be financed through the EU budget, but I think that other possible sources should be weighed up, including innovative forms of financing.
I am not taking the same attitude as others here who believe that countries like Greece, Ireland and Portugal did everything right: that they made no mistakes and did not go too far; that they did everything right and it was only the international crisis that caused problems.
I am not unaware of the many problems that a radical revision of the Union's current system of institutional representation in multilateral international bodies would lead to, in particular, as regards potentially strengthening the EU's position in the UN. The House's insistence on the need for a comprehensive review of the UN Security Council and the need to make it more legitimate, representative of regions and effective by assigning the Union a permanent seat therefore remains an objective that will be hard to achieve in the short term.
I am now going to explain the position of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe.
I am now pleased to turn to today's second subject, which has also already been addressed by Mr Zver, namely, the subject of Youth on the Move, which, of course, is a flagship initiative of the Europe 2020 strategy.
I am particularly satisfied with Commissioner Cioloș's announcement that all possibilities will be explored also within the first pillar to draw young people into agriculture.
I am pleased that Parliament's first report drafted after the Commission communication features very many guiding principles in common with the latter document.
I am pleased that the Commission, at least, is prepared to present an impactsassessment by September 2013, which, apart from country of origin, will also focus on harmonised methods for treating products, size labelling, and the inclusion of information on hazardous substances, allergens, flammability and so on. It remains to be seen whether this will have any effect in two years' time on the Council, which protects the interests of businesses importing textiles from third countries more than it protects European producers and consumers.
I am pleased that the Commissioner has met Parliament half way on these three points, and I look forward to being able to work closely with Commissioner Šemeta next year as rapporteur. I would like to thank Mr Chatzimarkakis. I will try to carry on your work well during the next year.
I am pleased that the committee has approved the report, after much deliberation, and I know, through colleagues from right across the committee, the painstaking work that was done to try and come forward with something that was acceptable.
I am pleased that the report on the cultural dimensions of the EU's external actions, which affirms that culture must be at the heart of European diplomacy, has been adopted.
I am pleased that you fundamentally agree with the concept of the European legal framework and that you support our proposals on the responsibility for the national programmes, on clear working, timing and financial requirements, on information and on the full involvement of the general public at an early stage in every national implementation process.
I am pleased that, as part of the Europe 2020 strategy, we are focusing particular attention on young people, given the demographic challenges which our continent has to face.
I am pleased to be one of those signing this resolution, which reaffirms the importance of respect for democracy and human rights in relations between the European Union and Russia.
I am pleased to say that our new government yesterday announced measures to help SMEs which were broadly welcomed by the business community today - measures relating to VAT, PRSI, travel tax and internships.
I am pleased to see that our Green Paper has sparked, in Europe and within the European institutions, a very rich debate on the right environment to put in place to meet the specific needs of creating entrepreneurship in order to seize the new opportunities offered by globalisation, digitisation and cultural diversity. I am firmly convinced that our joint efforts will help to create a better environment in which these vital industries can play an important role in the discussions on EU funding mechanisms post-2013 and implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy.
I am pleased to see that the report stresses the importance of closer links between direct payments and conservation of natural resources. I want to establish an effective, pan-European instrument that achieves the objective of simplifying the direct payment system. I am a strong advocate of decoupling direct payments, which has proved beneficial in helping farmers to adapt better to market conditions.
I am pleased to see that, after years of negotiations, agreement between the different political groups has finally been reached and that the new Consumer Rights Directive has finally been adopted today.
I am positive that the Commission report will assess the effects of a possible system for designating origin, so that the legislators can make a sound decision at a future point.
I am really puzzled by the fact that only two Member States, Italy and Lithuania, insisted in the Council on including origin marking, and I wonder what interest the other European countries have in not protecting their own businesses in this way, since they are thus left more exposed to problems of unfair competition and counterfeiting.
I am really very disappointed about what has happened to our resolution and I very much regret that we have allowed ourselves to be carried away by our emotions.
I am referring, in this sense, more to the Member States than to yourself, in the call to construct the role of the European Union in a more structured multilateral world order and to draft a real EU foreign policy, setting aside any renationalising tendencies and temptations that are appearing in a number of our Member States.
I am saying this, therefore, to thank all those people.
I am sorry if there is a false impression about the Commission's views on Schengen. I do not think I have spoken about anything other than Schengen for the last month! I have emphasised how important Schengen is, what a gift it is to the European Union and that we must strengthen it and not weaken it.
I am sure that the Commissioner will agree that these are exactly the kind of figures that will help to stimulate the economy and create jobs, not only throughout the United Kingdom, but also in India.
I am sure that the European Union will have to play an important role in the fight against poverty and in the revitalisation of Sudan's economy. I would therefore like to stress the importance of maintaining the Union's humanitarian aid to Sudan and to South Sudan.
I am sure that with Parliament's strengthened role under the Treaty of Lisbon we will be able to translate these goals, which for now are merely theoretical, into concrete actions.
I am the grandson of a German and feel deep affection for that country, but the German authorities have clearly acted hastily and rashly in this particular case.
I am therefore in favour of a regulation that enhances the uniformity of the rules for European textile imports by aligning them with those for other industrial goods.
I am therefore in favour of the creation of additional indicators for measuring medium- and long-term social and economic progress, for example, indicators that take account of climate change, biodiversity, resource efficiency and social inclusion.
I am therefore pleased that the European Parliament has managed to initiate specific legislative measures, such as greater cooperation over the introduction of a European patent. I also consider the area of standardisation very important in relation to the introduction of innovations into practice, as well as their application by small and medium-sized enterprises.
I am thinking in particular of the question of food security, which is one of agriculture's underlying aims. I am also thinking of the importance of preserving the two pillars of the common agricultural policy, as Mr Dess has just said, whilst also recognising the need to make the policy greener and to focus more on integrating the sound management of natural resources. I am also referring to a fairer distribution of common agricultural policy money between European farmers and to the need for a budget that is able to address food and regional issues, but also the management of natural resources in the European Union.
I am told that Mr de Magistris requested the defence of his immunity.
I am very concerned about the heavy burden of death and disease that this food-borne epidemic has caused the European population and want to take the opportunity once again to express my condolences to those who are suffering as a result.
I am very happy to inform you that already today we have more than 3800 registrants in the Commission register.
I am very pleased by the adoption of the amendment I tabled, which has been included as paragraph 167 and which calls for cooperation with the countries participating in the Eastern Partnership, and I hope that paragraph 71 will be similarly amended.
I am very pleased that MEPs have decided to support the amendment I tabled regarding the strengthening of policies on youth.
I am very positive about this resolution concerning the Small Business Act review, as it contains the correct measures to undertake in order to make it easier for over 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises to do business.
I am voting against Amendment 11 concerning the withholding of European funds for regions that use the 'Ley de Costas' in a retroactive way without compensation for the citizens affected. I completely disagree with the current state of affairs regarding 'Ley de Costas', but I also think that, especially in this moment of economic crisis, it is not responsible to take such a strong stand, as hundreds of thousands of citizens would be affected if funds were withheld.
I am voting for the amended Commission proposal having regard to the interinstitutional agreement of 20 December 1994 on an accelerated working method for the official codification of legislative texts and, in particular, to point 4 thereof.
I am voting for the proposal of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, which considers the Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA) to have seemingly contributed to the overexploitation of some stocks, particularly octopus, and has therefore reduced fishing opportunities for Mauritanian fishermen and given the EU industry a competitive advantage as a result of subsidised access fees for EU vessels, I welcome the European Commission's proposal to open negotiations on the renewal of the protocol of the FPA between the EU and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania. I also welcome the European Commission's proposal to introduce a human rights clause into the agreement, and call on the Commission to establish a dialogue with Mauritania aiming to help the country further develop a responsible fisheries policy which meets both conservation requirements and its objective to promote the economic development of fisheries resources.
I am voting for the tabled report, and I call for robust financing for the initiative, which is indispensable to sustainable growth.
I am voting for this Agreement as I believe that, besides the economic benefits it brings, it will also establish mutual acceptance of certification findings in all areas of airworthiness for all Member States.
I am voting for this joint motion for a resolution. I would highlight the measures I consider necessary: making use of all the possibilities and financial margins available under the EU fisheries budget in order to finance emergency support measures for this sector, thereby enabling it to overcome the difficulties posed by the rise in oil prices; continued European Fisheries Fund (EFF) aid to improve the selectivity of fishing gear and to replace engines on safety grounds, to protect the environment and/or fuel economy, above all, for small-scale coastal and traditional fishing; the drawing up by the Commission of a medium- and long-term plan aimed at improving fuel efficiency in the fisheries (including aquaculture) sector; and calling for the Commission to propose an action plan for coastal regions and islands which have an active fisheries sector to improve fuel efficiency in the fisheries and aquaculture sector.
I am voting for this motion for a resolution, and would express the same conviction as the rapporteur that awarding the title of European Capital of Culture to a city which was the site of such tragic events in the course of the 20th century would be an important step towards transcending historical European divisions and showcasing the new Europe.
I am voting for this motion for a resolution, given that the multilateral trade system continues to be by far the most effective framework for achieving equitable and fair trade at international level.
I am voting for this own-initiative report since it tackles the current issues in the interminable debate on the ratings industry: specifically, the lack of competition, oligopolistic structures, and the lack of accountability and transparency, primarily as regards rating sovereign debt.
I am voting for this proposal as I believe there is a need for EU-wide momentum to encourage cultural and creative industries (CCIs), which is why they must adopt innovative economic models and have access to new, legal on-line service provision.
I am voting for this proposal as it amends certain aspects of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009, so as to extend its validity to 31 December 2015 and make certain adjustments resulting from the entry into force of bilateral agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Serbia.
I am voting for this proposal as this initiative aims to achieve the major objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy of reducing school drop-out rates from 15% to 10% and of increasing the percentage of people with tertiary education from 31% to 40% by 2020.
I am voting for this proposal given that the crisis has been wiping out millions of jobs and has increased job insecurity and poverty; that 17% of EU residents are at risk of poverty; that 23 million EU residents are unemployed; that much domestic work takes place in the informal economy, under precarious employment conditions and/or as undeclared work and that, in addition to this, in industrialised countries, domestic work accounts for between 5% and 9% of all employment; that the vast majority of the people employed in that sector are women; that such work is undervalued, underpaid and informal; and that domestic workers' vulnerability means they are often discriminated against and subjected to unfair or abusive treatment. I welcome and support the International Labour Organisation (ILO) initiative to adopt a convention supplemented by a recommendation on decent work for domestic workers. I call on the EU countries that are members of the ILO to adopt these instruments at the ILO conference in June 2011.
I am voting for this proposal, as pre-school end early-childhood education are provided in accordance with various traditions throughout the European continent, making the creation of a universal European system for early-childhood education difficult.
I am voting for this proposal, given that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an animal health issue for the European livestock sector, especially when treatment failure occurs; that guidelines on the prudent use of antimicrobials have already been issued in several Member States, which has led to a reduction in the usage of antimicrobials; that the livestock sector - dairy, beef meat, pig and poultry meat, eggs, sheep and goat milk and meat production - plays a major role in the European agricultural economy; and that farmers' primary goal is to keep their livestock healthy and productive through good agricultural practices relating to hygiene, proper feed, appropriate husbandry and responsible animal health management. I therefore call on the Commission to develop a broad, multiannual action plan against AMR within the framework of the EU animal health strategy (2011-2015).
I am voting for this proposal, given that the report has achieved a balanced approach between the most important issues for the organisation and the activities of the European External Action Service, and for the key areas of security and defence policy.
I am voting for this proposal, with the amendments of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.
I am voting for this report and welcome the provision aimed at ensuring that trade between both parties develops smoothly within a high level of customs security and that it includes a set of rules to ensure that the agreement and the EU acquis remain in alignment.
I am voting for this report as I believe it is essential that we confront failures to comply with international social legislation both inside and outside Europe; these constitute forms of social and environmental dumping that are damaging to European companies and workers.
I am voting for this report because I share the rapporteur's view that IAs are crucial in order for us to carry out our work as law makers.
I am voting for this report because I understand that only by reinforcing European research, development and innovation policy will it be possible for it to increase its competitiveness and adopt an increasingly leading role at global level. I also consider it important that the Seventh Framework Programme contributes to establishing the European Research Area, pursuant to Article 179(1) of Title XIX of the Treaty on European Union.
I am voting for this report because culture can be a key element in international relations by contributing to development, inclusion, democracy and conflict prevention.
I am voting for this report because it includes a range of concerns highlighted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D), by acknowledging the limitations of gross domestic product (GDP) and the need to include additional indicators to measure economic and social progress in the medium and long terms. I would also draw attention to the establishment of clear and measurable indicators that take into account climate change, biodiversity, efficient resource utilisation and social inclusion, which could help lead to a more inclusive society based on knowledge, and to lower carbon emissions.
I am voting for this report because it is a thorough evaluation of the process and implementation to date and because it launches a debate on its future governance, exploitation and financing of the decision to create global navigation satellite systems and other autonomous European systems.
I am voting for this report because the amendments introduced by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D) were included in the compromise text.
I am voting for this report in that it presents suitable political priorities for Parliament for the Multiannual Financial Framework, in both legislative and budgetary terms.
I am voting for this report, as it examines the needs of urban areas, focusing mainly on two aspects: basic infrastructure, and smart investment in infrastructures and services based on technological advances. I also agree with the call for attention to be given to strategic planning principles, and with the need for cross-financing that is more flexible between the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF).
I am voting for this report, as it sends a clear signal of EU solidarity with the crisis that the European public is facing at present.
I am voting for this report, as the new version of the proposal for Rule 51 aims to achieve three important objectives: firstly, making the provision more readily understandable and therefore easier to use; secondly, laying down new conditions governing the application of the procedure; and thirdly, clarifying the objective of the procedure.
I am voting for this report, but I believe that a potential optional system could be beneficial for consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises if the Commission puts forward concrete data that indicate a need for further progress in order for the consultation carried out by the Commission to remain transparent.
I am voting for this report, firstly because it criticises the Commission for delaying publication until 9 February 2011, even though it was obliged to table it in 2010, and because, like the rapporteur, I regret the weakness of the Commission communication as regards new developments. I also regret the lack of good results as regards small and medium-sized enterprises. I do, however, acknowledge that the joint technology initiatives help make European industry more competitive, although the already existing legal and administrative obstacles need to be dealt with quickly.
I am voting for this report, given that the current Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and São Tomé and Príncipe has been in force since 2006 and that the protocol for this agreement expired on 31 May 2011.
I am voting for this report, given the positive results of the evaluations carried out on both countries to establish whether they meet the requirements of the Schengen acquis.
I am voting for this report, since it took into account the main concerns of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament.
I am voting in favour because, inter alia, the report includes a proposal stressing the need to assess the specific situation of the milk and dairy products sector before March 2015, in order to ensure the proper functioning and stability of the milk market. I view this adoption as an important message from the European Parliament to let the Commission know, without taking dogma into consideration, if a decision taken years previously on the basis of certain rules will introduce real benefits when the time comes for it to enter into force, taking into account the situation 12 years later, or if it will contribute to exacerbating the situation instead.
I am voting in favour for the sake of transparency and of acting without obstacles posed by the legal system.
I am voting in favour of the appointment of Mr Draghi as President of the ECB as I believe that he has an extensive academic background and wide professional experience, and because I advocate a strong commitment from the European institutions to combating inflation, to strengthening the single currency and to sustainability in the sovereign debt crisis. I also believe that the new President of the ECB will implement a culture of honesty and rigour, as well as helping to set out robust and consistent economic policy, sending a clear signal of confidence to the international markets.
I am voting in favour of the participation of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), as the EMCDDA is open to the participation of any third country, and particularly bearing in mind that Croatia is a transit route through which illicit drugs are smuggled on the way from the production countries to consumer countries. I therefore believe that its immediate involvement is essential.
I am voting in favour of this agreement as I consider it essential that the position adopted by the European Commission, and stressed in this report, expresses the fact that Parliament should regularly monitor the entire process through the sharing of information, and that the Commission should submit a report analysing the strengths and weaknesses of the existing agreements at least every three years.
I am voting in favour of this draft European Parliament legislative resolution on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and financial contribution provided for in the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe.
I am voting in favour of this motion for a resolution of the European Parliament since it expresses its dissatisfaction with the Commission due to the fact that, by the end of 2009, only 75% of the total amount of EUR 21 billion worth of financial support had been made fully available for only 50 000 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The excessive administrative bureaucracy that is an obstacle to the majority of SMEs must be removed.
I am voting in favour of this report as it covers the Commission's objectives of simplifying the legislation in force with a view to creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses, mainly with respect to the simplification of customs formalities carried out by importers of textile products.
I am voting in favour of this report because I believe that the moment has come to harmonise the European legal system in terms of consumer protection.
I am voting in favour of this report, which highlights the benefits deriving from increased cooperation between neighbouring regions of different Member States. I agree with the transformation of the objective of territorial cooperation into one of the pillars of cohesion policy in the Community as soon as it is necessary, from the point of view of enhancing the synergies between neighbouring territories that naturally have the same needs and problems, to improve capabilities and increase the means of political, economic and administrative exchange between neighbouring regions. I also believe that the proposal in the report to increase the Community's financial commitment in order to uphold this pillar of political cohesion is a positive one.
I am voting in favour of this resolution because it is necessary to begin negotiations for the renewal of the protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Union and the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.
I am voting in favour of this resolution, which relates to a chapter of the European commercial policy that should be taken as a model for negotiations with other countries - including India, China and Pakistan - which certainly do not guarantee fair competition, let alone respect for social rights and environmental standards, as Canada does.
I am wondering what the outcome of this Council will be. It is supposed to be an opportunity to debate the progress made in the application of asylum and immigration policies, and the consequences of the Arab revolutions, at Europe's borders.
I appreciated the method followed by the rapporteur in evaluating the outcome and modalities of the EU cooperation for development.
I ask the Hungarian members of Parliament and the representatives of Hungarian authorities to abandon nationalistic games and playing around with peace treaties which remain unrealised and which they perceive as unjust.
I attach a lot of importance to the activities and initiatives associated with the external dimension of the European Union's social policy, the aim of which is to promote social standards in third countries in order to prevent, among other things, the present-day slavery in which people are treated purely as 'production machines', rather than valuable individuals.
I believe - President Barroso is not here any more - that his prudence won him his second election. I would very much like to vote for him for a third time, but this time for his courage.
I believe further discussion of the strategic framework of the Union's foreign policy is necessary, as well as a deeper knowledge of the scope of the CFSP and the mechanisms for its establishment, which should be made available to the various political players.
I believe in the positive impact of simplifying and improving the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products, particularly encouraging the development and uptake of new fibres.
I believe it is, therefore, very important that the final resolution includes a clear call for full effective investigation into the European Union Member States' complicity and their renditions and secret detention programmes.
I believe it represents a step forward for consumer and environmental protection, including in terms of the positions of individual Member States, which sometimes complain of delays.
I believe that Mr Falbr has drafted a good report, and so I would like to explain why I decided to vote in favour of its adoption.
I believe that Mrs Lagarde will be a worthy and able representative of the European Union; she is well qualified for the job thanks to the experience which she acquired during this stormy period of economic crisis and I believe that she will be a worthy representative of the European economy within the framework of global economic governance.
I believe that a better range of statistics on the environmental consequences of the policies of Member States and the EU is needed, as well as on accounting for certain taxes that support environmental policies.
I believe that a rapprochement in the field of aeronautics will create a huge opportunity for the European and Japanese economies.
I believe that a voluntary register is simply a sham and will not offer greater transparency or bring us to a point where the Council of Ministers will be prepared to get involved, so we do not even have all the key legislative bodies on board.
I believe that achieving and sustaining quality of life involves important, interlinked factors such as health, education, culture, jobs, housing and environmental condition. I therefore believe that the indicators measuring these factors are also important, and that more importance should be attached to them. I voted in favour because this report is a step, albeit a hesitant one, towards improving and complementing gross domestic product (GDP) as an instrument for the measurement and evaluation of social and economic performance, and, by association, of societies' progress.
I believe that both parties would have much to gain from a free trade agreement (FTA) that would strengthen their trade relations and remove barriers which have unjustifiably hindered relations. I regret that such an objective still seems far from becoming reality and I hope Europe and Japan will persevere in their efforts to attain it.
I believe that future regional policy should be linked to basic European objectives in the areas of innovation, research, environmental and energy challenges, and should, of course, help to create European added value, but only with follow-ups that are as transparent and effective as possible.
I believe that in both the European Parliament and in the European Commission, we have to work to speed up the procedure.
I believe that it is essential to adopt the single European patent in order to encourage a move towards commercial exchanges outside the Union.
I believe that it is in our interest as Europeans, European citizens, that the Member States act together in external matters.
I believe that peace in the Middle East is sensitive enough, and UNRWA's work important enough, not to be subjected, year after year, to the Commission's game of proposing lower figures which then rise during the negotiation on budgetary procedure.
I believe that some Member States have deliberately sabotaged the negotiations.
I believe that the Commission proposal on the provisions for tractors placed on the market under the flexibility scheme contains timely, simple and effective measures.
I believe that the Commission should take a holistic approach towards the proper coordination of the management of the spectrum across the EU in view of the fact that this public good is a scarce and finite resource and is crucial to the furtherance of consumers, citizens and businesses within the single market.
I believe that the Directive will establish a legal framework in the European Union for the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, and will form an integral part of EU legislation, ensuring the safe use of nuclear energy in those Member States which retain it in their energy mix.
I believe that the European Parliament has the right to discuss the legislative solutions enshrined in the constitutions of its Member States.
I believe that the European Urban Agenda is a policy of undoubted importance, given that 70% of the European population lives in cities, and that these people generate about 80% of EU gross domestic product (GDP). A total of EUR 21.1 billion has been earmarked for urban development in 2007-2013, to be targeted at the rehabilitation of industrial sites and contaminated land areas, urban and rural regeneration, clean urban transport, and housing.
I believe that the Mitchell report, which is an extremely good report, touches on many key issues, and I therefore decided to vote in favour of it. I believe that what matters most when considering the future shape of financing instruments for development is to remember that the overriding aim of development policy should be to reduce dependence on aid gradually, and for the country in question ultimately to achieve total independence.
I believe that the agreed text is a balanced compromise that incorporates many of the amendments presented by Parliament and leaves room for further developments in the near future, which - as Mrs Győri pointed out during her speech - is very important.
I believe that the example shown by the aerospace industry in Northern Ireland is a significant one - larger companies mentoring and helping smaller companies to actually access the programme - and I would use this opportunity to call upon the Commissioner to provide us with radical and new ways for small and medium-sized enterprises to benefit from this very important programme.
I believe that the first thing we need to do is to assess the impact, which will shed some light on the pros and cons of such an agreement.
I believe that the package of interventions contained in the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council may be effective in preventing macroeconomic imbalances, especially in the euro area.
I believe that the reconciliation between Hamas and Fatah and their readiness to found a state represent a major opportunity, because founding a state involves commitment and responsibility.
I believe that the solutions we are providing to these issues are not good enough and that we should focus much greater attention on the way in which Member States implement the projects and programmes which we have in mind here. I believe that the European Commission's role is to encourage more Member States to implement these programmes properly and meet young people's needs.
I believe that this - the problem of foreign investment in South Sudan - will soon be a new front line that the European Union must monitor and on which it must assert the credibility it has earned in recent years in this region.
I believe that this Partnership Agreement is mutually advantageous for the fisheries of both the European Union and Seychelles.
I believe that this is a key point to be remembered at all times; in other words, through the programme, we can develop the great potential for economic exploitation of this field by the telecommunications sector, the audiovisual sector and new services, while, at the same time, giving a boost to economic development and to other sectors linked to the telecommunications sector.
I believe that this is the only way we can move toward becoming a modern parliament. I have been in charge of one report and in the explanatory statement I listed all the agents with whom I worked, because it is a way of working and an attitude that we should clearly separate from all the irresponsible acts we have seen in the past.
I believe that we are witnessing a trend whereby national constitutions are seen as an area where there is no room for political debate among European democracies.
I believe that we should also think about the subjects that we want to focus on in the immediate future. I remember well that Mrs Palacio once said that the issue would only appear on the agenda again when the next nuclear disaster happened.
I believe that we should ask the Committee on Foreign Affairs to discuss the situation in Egypt, including everything that has gone on between the minorities, to draft an own-initiative report, and then simply to hold a debate on Egypt with Baroness Ashton one month later.
I believe that what is at stake in this European Council, regardless of the technical solutions or political disagreements, is knowing whether or not we want the European project to continue to be a valid blueprint for a strategy for peace in Europe. I believe that is what is at stake.
I believe that with everything we are achieving here, the Union will be increasingly prepared to coordinate and to prevent potential problems, shortcomings and imbalances in a unified way.
I believe that with today's vote, the European Parliament has sent a strong and clear signal to the Member States asking to freeze the European Union budget for 2014-2020.
I believe that, although implementing economic policy programmes related to credit agreements means serious efforts for the Member States, at the same time, this is also an opportunity to face up to long-standing structural problems and to find solutions and answers to these within a short period, which, in the medium term, could lead to sustainable and higher growth in these countries.
I believe that, in place of purely incremental budgets, we should have zero-based budgeting at the beginning of each parliamentary session, and furthermore that the institutions' budgets should be multiannual budgets.
I believe the Commission should have a stronger and more independent role in the enhanced surveillance procedure as regards assessments that are specific to each Member State, monitoring, missions and recommendations. I support the Union method, and therefore I agree that the role of the Council should be limited in the steps leading to potential sanctions.
I believe the Stability and Growth Pact should be updated and fiscal policy coordination improved in order to strengthen surveillance of national budgets and ensure that Member States take 'prudent' decisions in good times for the economy, building up the necessary buffer for the bad times.
I believe the debate we will now have is a useful opportunity for this House to give its views on these negotiations.
I believe this matter should be taken into consideration at least by Parliament's Bureau, because we cannot allow some of the things we have heard here today to be said on behalf of committees representing so many members of Parliament.
I believe we all broadly share the view that balanced and healthy public finances are a necessary condition for sustainable growth and improving employment, which is the goal of the current legislative package.
I believe, however, that it falls short in one important area, in that it fails to answer the fundamental question asked by our taxpayers and our consumers who pay for the common agricultural policy: what are the direct decoupled payments for? That is a fundamental question that we all need to face up to. There is no longer any linkage with food production because they are decoupled.
I call on Member States to monitor actions to facilitate the transition from school to working life by developing integrated careers guidance and advice programmes, to create better training opportunities for trainers and lay the foundations for a facilitative learning partnership, particularly at regional and local level.
I call on the British Prime Minister to reduce the UK's contribution to the EU in line with the amount of the irregularities if the European Parliament fails to act in the interests of the British taxpayer.
I call on the Commission and Member States to cooperate with partner countries with the aim of placing greater emphasis on combating child labour with a view to creating instead decent jobs for adults and allowing children to receive a suitable education.
I call on the Commission to exert pressure to counter possible opposition on all these points; I am sure it can count on the support of Parliament in this.
I call your attention to the need for continued cooperation on the part of the international community, the UN, the African Union and the European Union in consolidating both countries, in securing peace and the building of institutions for a democratic and pluralistic South Sudan.
I can assure you that, globally, what Europe has done in this respect is seen as the right thing to do and we are applauded by people in developing countries and by our development partners for taking this approach to food assistance.
I can only agree with the desire expressed by Mr Leinen today when he said that, by the end of this decade, we should have moved away from gross domestic product and towards a green domestic product.
I can only be in favour of the choice to put Mario Draghi forward as the new President of the European Central Bank (ECB) for an eight-year term beginning next November.
I can reassure you that the Commission will work until the last minute, the last second, to find a satisfactory solution.
I can understand why a Minister, on receiving the information that the cucumbers are responsible, would issue a warning accordingly, but where is the detailed coordination? Where is the genuine decision-making authority? It seems to me - and I say this very cautiously - that action was taken just as prematurely with the bean sprouts as with the cucumbers.
I can well imagine that a free trade agreement with Japan would make sense, but before we enter into such negotiations, it is not too much to ask that we first wait for the results from the existing instrument, namely this high-level dialogue. I want to be very open about this and I am not saying this in order to take away any negotiating chips from Japan, but because I would genuinely like to see whether Japan is serious about intensifying trade relations with us and genuinely opening up its markets and also its attitude to our products.
I certainly do not understand how they can sit in this hemicycle and defend an intergovernmental approach.
I close by saying the following.
I come from a country whose government was rather tardy in expressing its interest in this directive. I therefore hope that Parliament's decision will be productive and function as a stimulus so that the attitudes and the level of attention for this issue will be substantially improved in the not too distant future.
I commend especially paragraph 9 of the report, which invites the Bureau to set up a system of legislative footprints whereby rapporteurs can record those that have lobbied in the course of progressing a draft law.
I concur with the rapporteur in affirming the great importance of 'territorial cooperation', which aims to remove physical, administrative and regulatory obstacles and reduce the 'border effect' between regions, promoting their harmonious development.
I congratulate Mr Hökmark on preparing such a topical report on the radio spectrum policy programme. I voted in favour of it since I firmly endorse all measures aimed at supporting and implementing the internal single market.
I congratulate my colleague Mr Pieper and all the rapporteurs for the excellent report that was presented.
I consider it extremely important for the European Union to play a key role in international organisations. I believe that the decisions made on international policy should not violate the sovereignty of individual Member States. I am also against weakening the role played by each country in the European Union individually in international organisations.
I consider it of the utmost importance to adopt a position in harmony with the Member States' foreign policies, since such cohesion will lead to peace, security, solidarity and conflict prevention at international level.
I consider regrettable the European Commission's decision not to wait until Parliament has adopted its report on Europe's future international investment policy and that it has decided to go ahead and offer India a mandate to negotiate for an investment chapter.
I consider that stress tests should be undertaken not only within the European Union and neighbouring countries, but at a global level.
I consider the cultural aspect of European policies which strives for increased European cohesion important. I therefore welcome all cultural programmes whose objective is to create a European identity from shared values and mutual understanding.
I consider the support for activities related to the sea and the creation of a new category for regions that have between 75% and 90% of EU per capita income to be very positive for Galicia.
I continue to believe that the traceability issue affects the competitiveness of SMEs and - just as my top priority since being appointed as a European Commissioner has been SME policy, so continuing the work of my predecessor - I intend to continue protecting the health of consumers through quality products which will be the only competitive ones on the international market, because the competitiveness of European Union products is measured in terms of quality.
I could cite a lot of economies that we are competing with who have now realised that they also have to conduct ambitious environment policies, energy policies and climate policies.
I decided to abstain at the final vote because we lost Amendment 1 on reference to NATO, Amendment 3 against a nuclear dimension in the common security and defence policy, Amendment 4 against flexible use of Battlegroups, Amendment 5 against using Battlegroups for mixed civilian-military tasks, Amendment 6 deleting a provision on defence research, Amendment 7 deleting a provision on defence research, Amendment 8 deleting reference to the US Department of Homeland Security, Amendment 9 deleting reference to CSDP cooperation with Frontex in the Mediterranean, and despite the fact that we won Amendment 2 on European External Action Service/Commission permanent working structures and Amendment 1 saying no to NATO developing civilian capabilities.
I decided to vote against this proposal because it would have a very negative impact on the smallest haulage companies in particular.
I decided to vote in favour of Mr Falbr's report which, on the one hand, captures the strategic importance of corporate social responsibility as a motivational tool to stimulate business growth and, on the other, underlines that this issue can only be tackled on a voluntary basis. I also completely agreed with Mr Falbr's critical approach, whereby he disapproves of the hypocritical behaviour of the European Union simultaneously promoting a social model that fosters social rights while also entering into commercial agreements with countries that do not respect or provide protection for workers.
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday, 7 April 2011.
I did have a question for the Commissioner further on, which we will not get to tonight, and which did indeed ask for his view on the merging of the ESF and the EGF, on which you have spoken but did not give us an opinion.
I did not agree with the postponement either, because we are in a position in which we need to give our citizens urgent responses to the economic crisis, which is not just the result of financial speculation, but also of our inability to deal with the problems of recovery and growth.
I did not vote for the Casini report on the establishment of a common transparency register. I consider that the establishment of such a register is a breach of the freedom that all politicians should enjoy.
I did not vote in favour of paragraph 85 of the Albertini report which welcomes the resumption of the negotiations on an association agreement with Mercosur.
I do believe, ladies and gentlemen, that in including Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area, which comprises more than four hundred million human beings, we are adding, not subtracting; we are building a stronger Europe.
I do have one doubt, which we have expressed by voting to adopt the amendment removing the wording on the creation of an intermediate category for cohesion policies in those parts of Europe where gross domestic product (GDP) falls to between 75% and 90% of EU GDP.
I do have reservations about the insufficiently flexible approach taken by the Commission to these concessions, but I am also not particularly satisfied with the Commission's stance - not with your position, directly, Mr Dalli, but at one point, one of your fellow Commissioners, the Belgian Commissioner, Mr De Gucht, went behind the backs of the conciliation committee to appear before this Parliament's Committee on International Trade, where he proceeded to present a whole series of sophisms.
I do not agree with the proposal to charge heavy goods vehicles according to air and noise pollution. I feel that it would be inappropriate to create yet another additional tax burden for hauliers, who have been badly affected by the financial crisis.
I do not believe that the own resources ceiling should be revised, as it should be possible to finance EU policy within the current income ceiling. I also see a need for a review of the EU's own resources system.
I do not believe that the temporary Special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 is the right body to make recommendations for such an intermediate category.
I do not doubt that they mean well but the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
I do not intend to support Mrs Hirsch's own-initiative report, not so much because of its statements of principle, which are commendable in terms of emphasising the importance of bringing the labour market and the world of formal training closer together, but because, once again, we are lacking a practical, proactive approach to the issue that transcends sterile considerations and offers concrete solutions to resolve a social emergency that cannot be resolved through rhetoric.
I do not need any lessons from you in this regard. I do not defend Christians against Muslims. I defend all human beings who live on this planet, so that they can live free and equal - all of them!
I do not support the proposal to create an entirely new legal instrument in the form of a European contract law.
I do not think that anyone should be afraid to face the truth and certainly Parliament could, with a new report on this issue, bring some daylight to the issue and also do away with unjustified claims and suspicions.
I do not think that we would be having this debate if everything had gone well.
I do not wish to elaborate on the matter but, on the specific issue of the order of business, I would even so like to say that I am a little shocked - to put it mildly - that, as no debate has been scheduled, I cannot present my point of view to the House, even for two or three minutes. I believe there is a case for presenting it, because it seems to me that the rapporteur has recycled the argument cited last time by Mrs Wallis, who concluded that my parliamentary immunity should be lifted, something that the Court of Justice condemned in very clear terms.
I drew attention to the fact, acknowledged by the 2009 European Innovation Panel, that the economic and financial crisis is having a disproportionate impact on a number of countries and regions, thereby undermining the objective of convergence.
I endorsed adoption of the directive. I think the decision to extend the financing of Eurovignettes by external costs, in other words, by the costs of environmental pollution and noise, is more advisable than the previous version, which was restricted only to covering the costs of road infrastructure.
I endorsed the document because it advocates advancing effective multilateralism as the overriding strategic concern of the Union and strengthening the coherence and visibility of the EU as a global actor at the UN, inter alia, by better coordinating internal EU consultations on UN issues and by promoting greater outreach on a wide range of issues.
I endorsed the report because the added value of EU membership in multilateral organisations lies in the fields where it has exclusive or shared competences: economic and trade matters, environmental policy, development aid, and security and defence policy.
I endorsed the report on improving Europe's education and training systems. I am in favour of extending the operation of all educational programmes for young people.
I endorsed this document because EU forests and other wooded land account for more than 42% of the EU's surface.
I endorsed this document because it is aimed at ensuring that national defence systems are consistent with EU defence systems, as well as coordinating strategies with the most important global actors, such as the United States, Russia, China, Turkey and the Arab countries.
I endorsed this document because its objective is to charge heavy goods vehicles depending on the time of day they are travelling, during or outwith rush hour, and depending on the sound emitted and cylinder capacity.
I endorsed this document because the Commission's proposal to repeal Council Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 and to amend Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 is driven by the European Union's policy commitment to simplify the legislation in force with a view to creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses, mainly with respect to the simplification of customs formalities carried out by importers of certain textile products released for free circulation in the Community, which fall within Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature.
I endorsed this document because the Treaty on European Union and, in particular, Article 11(1) and (2) thereof, provides a framework for, and seeks to foster relations between, the European institutions and European political leaders, on the one hand, and civil society, EU citizens and representative associations, on the other: 1. The institutions shall, by appropriate means, give citizens and representative associations the opportunity to make known and publicly exchange their views in all areas of Union action. 2. The institutions shall maintain an open, transparent and regular dialogue with representative associations and civil society.
I endorsed this document because, in 2009, the EU and Japan represented together more than a quarter of world GDP and more than 20% of world trade, and Japan and the EU are significant investors in each other's economies.
I endorsed this document, because firstly, the Committee responsible has found no evidence of a sufficiently serious and precise suspicion that the case has been brought with the intention of causing political damage to the Member.
I endorsed this document, because the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2009.
I endorsed this document, because the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the SESAR Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009.
I endorsed this report and discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2009.
I endorsed this report because the international system is undergoing rapid and profound change, driven by the shift of power towards emerging international actors and deepening interdependence, encompassing economic and financial problems, environmental deterioration and climate change, energy and resource scarcity, and interconnected security challenges.
I endorsed this report because, as we know, the main task of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is to collect data on drugs and drug addiction in order to prepare and publish objective, reliable and comparable information at European level.
I expect ex ante conditionality to be fully integrated into the programming process. I also expect ex ante conditionalities to be directly linked to the policy and to programme effectiveness, that their number will be limited, and that they will be tailored to the specific context and respect agreed criteria.
I expect that the High Representative and Vice President of the Commission, Baroness Ashton, as well as the Commission itself, will convey and represent to the Azerbaijani Government our disquiet over the suppression of democracy in the country, and demand immediate corrective action.
I fail to see how, with a diminished CAP, we will be able to respond - just to give another example - to price volatility, and establish a budget line, as is our intention, that will rise to the crisis we have come to know so well.
I fail to see how, with a reduced budget, we will be able to rise to all the challenges described in that document; how common agricultural policy subsidies will be made greener, a process we want to ensure will not require an additional effort on the part of agricultural and livestock farmers; how we will be able to achieve this.
I fear that the emphasis the Commission puts, as it were, on its own institutional rights is not being tracked through to its determination in practice, its zeal in practice, to take infringement proceedings if necessary. I have not heard of Rome and Paris receiving a letter of the kind that the President sent to Copenhagen.
I feel compelled to remind my fellow Members that the common agricultural policy is enshrined by the Treaties and is one of the few real European policies; it can play an important role in a strategic sector that provides public goods and generates true European added value.
I feel that EU and Russian relations with Belarus should also be discussed. A convergence of positions would help to open the prison gates for those who recently stood in the Belarusian elections and would stop blatant human rights abuses. I very much support those fellow Members who said that we need to translate words into deeds in the area of visa facilitation, and not just with Russia, but all of the European Union's eastern neighbours.
I feel that this is not a debate on budget volume, but rather on the supremacy of the Community method, and I think that those who have focused this debate on efforts to reduce the Union budget have made a mistake.
I find it highly regrettable that several Member States attempted, even after the conclusion of the trialogue negotiations, to throw a spanner in the works - they really did try - in connection with the correlation tables in order to block this directive.
I find it impossible to accept that two Member States and two gentlemen looking to make a name for themselves have managed to bring the issue of the reintroduction of border controls back to the debating chamber.
I firmly believe that MEPs will approve this report and that it will then be clearly approved by the Council. I wish the citizens of Romania and Bulgaria the rapture that I personally experienced in chopping down the border gate on 22 December 2007, when Slovakia became part of the Schengen area.
I firmly believe that an effective strategic framework can ensure a common approach and capitalise on the synergies between all the funds to support the cohesion policy objectives, such as those set out in the Treaties, and thus better serve the people of the EU and meet their expectations.
I firmly believe that professional education and training should be available and affordable on a lifelong basis, regardless of a person's position on the labour market or their income.
I firmly believe that the difficulties can only be surmounted if senior politicians understand that their role is, first and foremost, to calm tensions rather than fan the flames.
I fully agree with you that this is not only, or chiefly, an animal farming issue.
I fully support Ms Pack's initiative and I want to ask Parliament to support it and to do everything we can to include Sarajevo as a European cultural capital. I believe that, if we all want this, it absolutely can be possible, because it would be very disappointing if our ideas and common sense were to be blocked by bureaucracy.
I fully support the Committee on Budgetary Control's decision to postpone granting discharge to the European Medicines Agency in the light of what I feel are some very serious points. I should like to emphasise in particular the lack of guarantees regarding the independence of experts and managers, and hence the potential for conflicts of interest.
I fully support the ILO's initiative to adopt a convention supplemented by a recommendation on decent work for domestic workers.
I fully support the adoption, ratification and implementation of a convention on domestic work by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). For the most part, domestic workers work under precarious conditions, frequently find themselves in legally dubious administrative situations which make their situation even less stable, and are often victims of discrimination, inequality and unfair or abusive treatment.
I fully support the autonomous European global navigation satellite system, and I agree with the adoption of all the measures essential to securing its full operational capacity.
I fully support this position.
I had the privilege of drawing up the draft opinion for the Committee on Culture and Education on the Innovation Union and I emphasised a number of points.
I have a positive view of the report's focus on the common challenges that Europe is facing.
I have a warning to give, Commissioner: I want to see this happen on schedule. I do not want to see this dossier kicked into the long grass and for us to then have it put before us at the end of our term or for it to be held over into the next parliamentary term.
I have absolute respect for Mr Rutte, who is in favour of a 2.7% increase in the EU budget. I have taken note of this and am pleased that you have listened attentively because the positions of all governments are debated openly in this Parliament.
I have already had the opportunity to say in this House that it is time indeed that impact assessments be not only systematic, but, above all, credible.
I have already talked about the flotilla, some of the issues concerning the Palestinian authority and the discussions that are going on - Mr Belder, you raised them too - between Fatah and Hamas. I made it clear that our position on Hamas has not changed, but I made it clear that we support ways in which President Abbas can bring unity with Palestinians with his technocratic government and with elections, which is going to be so important.
I have also learnt that the Hungarian Government has launched a publicity campaign against the right to abortion, funded, and therefore apparently sanctioned, by the European Union. I would like to draw attention at this point to the fact that the right to abortion is a fundamental right for which thousands of women have fought and continue to fight in Europe, often at the risk of their lives, that it is supported by this Parliament and by the Hungarian citizens, and that it is recognised by 23 Member States out of 27.
I have also noted progress in the implementation of the principle of 'accessing funding for SMEs'. The government is supporting the set-up and development of at least 1 100 SMEs for young people.
I have always said in this House and beyond that the External Action Service is a force to prevent and resolve conflict, so let me just mention, too, that this is why our role in Serbia and Kosovo matters.
I have been informed by civil society organisations there that pre-emptive measures have been taken by the law enforcement agencies.
I have concerns about the provision of a review clause which will ask the Commission to investigate the possible introduction of a number of labelling requirements which have little added value and would place unacceptable burdens on businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises.
I have condemned that violence and called for an inquiry - an inquiry that has to be as thorough as it is independent and that should tell us exactly what happened.
I have finished my four minutes and I want to keep some time for the end of this debate, so I would just like to end by saying that in this time of austerity and times of economic difficulties, we must make sure that early years is still on the agenda and we still do what needs to be done in this important area.
I have heard many of you calling for continuing engagement with Russia, calling for the relationship and coordination with the Russian Federation to be further developed, but I also heard calls for more democracy and less corruption. I also heard a call for no harassment, which was reported in Nizhny Novgorod, although I respect the role of the Russian Federation in ensuring security for the summit.
I have just received news that parallel to this plenary session the Council agreed on the only open question regarding Frontex, so the negotiations on the strengthening of Frontex have been concluded with success. I thank Parliament for their cooperation.
I have made it clear since I took over the chair that I expect people to keep to their speaking time for the rest of this evening or else we are going to have trouble because we will run over midnight and I do not wish to do that.
I have no doubt that Mrs Sanchez-Schmid's report, which was adopted with a large majority, will have an influence on the work of the European Commission as it prepares the legislative proposals that it will bring forward in September.
I have not voted in favour of the Wortmann-Kool report either - I have voted against it - because it does not take into account the Stability and Growth Pact, the European Employment Strategy or the Europe 2020 strategy objectives, which are a source of hope for millions of Europeans, particularly the young.
I have now brokered a solution to the Ashraf crisis, which you have seen, Baroness Ashton.
I have one more point to make concerning Parliament's capacity to see the development of strategies.
I have read the report and I have spoken to many about the report on both sides.
I have received one motion for a resolution tabled in accordance with Rule 115(5) of the Rules of Procedure.
I have saved my final thanks for the President of the European Court of Auditors, Mr Caldeira, with whom Parliament always enjoys genuinely open and positive cooperation.
I have spoken on this issue before and I am voting for this report because I believe EU citizens have the right to know the make-up of the clothes they buy.
I have supported this initiative as the Commission must ensure that Member States comply with Directive 2006/114/EC on misleading and comparative advertising, which applies to business-to-business transactions.
I have taken note of the assessment of the report on the policy options presented in the Green Paper and the support for the innovative solution of an optional instrument, which means no harmonisation but giving consumers and businesses a choice of having a Europe-wide system. I have also seen the support for an instrument applicable in both B2C and B2B transactions, which favours a material scope covering sales contracts, contracts for the supply of digital content and some service contracts. I have taken very good note of what has been said by Parliament, namely, that any future instrument, whatever it looks like, should give consumers a high level of protection in order not to deprive them of the protection they would otherwise enjoy under national law.
I have taken notice of all the speeches that have been made on this report. I would simply like to stress a couple of points.
I have the impression that although we have already spoken many times about this in this Chamber, not much has come from these words of ours.
I have the pleasure of informing you that members of a delegation from the National Assembly of Mauritania have taken their seats in the official gallery. I would like to extend a warm welcome to this delegation led by Mr El Arbi Ould Sidi Ali.
I have to say I find it a truly sickening sight to see the country that actually invented democracy being bullied by you and the increasingly appalling International Monetary Fund and its people being told they have to accept this austerity package.
I have to say that both the inspection report and the opinion of the rapporteur himself are positive, and that we should thank them, while, at the same time, also expressing our exasperation.
I have to say that we have missed the chance to take a step forward, have condemned the agri-food industry to living with obsolete legislation and have put the brakes on European technological advancement, of which we are so supportive in theory.
I have to tell you that beyond the three or four words saying that Her Majesty's Government is disappointed by the report, the other parts of the letter are a real provocation: a provocation to Europe and the European Union, because their main point is that no increase in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is possible, and that we have to stick to the old MFF, the same figures, the same resources, naturally the same rebates, and certainly the same rebate for the UK. We must change nothing at all.
I have voted AGAINST granting the Director of the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy discharge in respect of the implementation of the Joint Undertaking's budget for the 2009 financial year.
I have voted against granting discharge for 2009 for the European Police College, as proposed by the rapporteur, because not even I am convinced by the irregular procedures adopted in the period under review. I consider that more details are required to provide a deeper and more detailed explanation showing the regularity of the accounts.
I have voted against paragraph 36 (split 2) and against paragraph 37, because issues of environmental planning come under regional or national authority, which means that decisions in these areas must be made by regional or national parliaments.
I have voted in favour as I believe that the European Union and Russia must use the Nizhny Novgorod Summit to strengthen strategic cooperation and achieve a global cooperation agreement on the social, political and economic system and include issues relating to democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental and human rights.
I have voted in favour of Mr Casini's report on the amendment of Rule 51 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure because this amendment is the result of work which summarises the stipulations that clarify the area in which Rule 51 can be applied.
I have voted in favour of budgetary discharge for the Community Fisheries Control Agency for 2009 because I appreciate the correctness, clarity and transparency of the accounts and the efficiency deriving from comprehensible and feasible planning.
I have voted in favour of discharge for 2009 for the General Budget of the European Aviation Safety Agency because, in spite of apparently dubious management of the funds available, the Court of Auditors has considered the accounts to be reliable and the underlying transactions legal and regular.
I have voted in favour of granting budgetary discharge to the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union for 2009 because in this report I have found high precision, great transparency and a notable orientation towards results.
I have voted in favour of granting discharge for 2009 in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training because the Centre has managed its funds soundly and in line with previous forecasts.
I have voted in favour of the agreement as it is intended to ensure that trade takes place with a high level of customs security and that a set of standards ever closer to the EU acquis is applied.
I have voted in favour of the resolution as I support Sudan and South Sudan and congratulate them on their conduct after the referendum, which will help build a democratic state in peace with prosperity and security with regard to human, social and economic rights in both countries.
I have voted in favour of this initiative as it is aimed at achieving better protection for consumer rights.
I have voted in favour of this initiative to help the 2 834 people made redundant by General Motors Belgium reintegrate back into the labour market because, as a result of the world economic and financial crisis, this company has not been able to expand the Antwerp production plant. I welcome the agreement reached by the social partners regarding the package of proposed measures.
I have voted in favour of this report because it supports the proposal of the Commission to mobilize the EGF in favour of Belgium in order to help 2834 workers made redundant in the primary enterprise General Motors Belgium to find jobs, which is in line with my position and the position of EPP group Moreover, the report reasonably indicates that the 2011 budget for the first time shows payment appropriations (EUR 47.608.950) on the EGF line.
I have voted in favour of this report because the amendment that is being considered for Rule 51, apart from being an innovative collaboration method between various committees, will make the Rule easier to understand and apply.
I hear what colleagues say about their security concerns, but I stand here as somebody who narrowly survived the Mumbai attacks and I say to those colleagues: this is not the time to turn your back on Pakistan.
I hope - and I am confident - that your votes will provide the basis for an agreement. I understand that tomorrow, there will be a vote on the amendments and on the report as a whole but - as Mr Caspary, among others, has said - I hope that this will not hinder us from reaching an early agreement at second reading.
I hope that Europe will give itself the means to promote its culture, so that its model and heritage can exert influence, so that Europe can defend its identity and is able to grow its economy.
I hope that after the postponement of discharge it will be possible to reach a definitive and forward-looking agreement between the competent parliamentary committee, the European Parliament and the European Council on the issues related to the discharge of the Council.
I hope that aid levels will not decrease, but rather will increase wherever possible, and that ways for it to effectively benefit the most deprived populations will be studied.
I hope that our agreement on the six-pack will pave the way for these instruments to be eventually converted into the Community-based ones.
I hope that the Council's statement tomorrow will be a positive one and that it will assure us of a positive result, and I wish to thank everyone who has contributed to that positive result.
I hope that the representatives of the European institutions will listen carefully and monitor the situation in Hungary, and that they will make an uncompromising statement very soon on the undermining of the borders and the Paris Peace Treaty, and on a Hungarian constitution which enshrines support for the collective rights of Hungarian minorities and the creation of collective self-governing areas.
I hope that this kind of problem, whereby the Council discharge has been postponed by Parliament, will never come up in the future again so I ask that even during the Hungarian Presidency we should have a political discussion and agreement.
I hope that tomorrow no European leader will default on solidarity, because Greece is just a page in the book which is Europe; so if we stand by Greece, we stand by Europe.
I hope that, in tomorrow's extraordinary meeting of European Union agriculture ministers, this damage caused to Spanish farmers will first of all be redressed with no exclusions, and secondly, that lessons will be learnt: namely, what should not be done in a situation that has indeed resulted in fatalities, but also concerning damage to the products of many countries including my own, Spain.
I hope very much that our rapporteur, Mr Coelho, will defend Parliament's prerogatives, as he always does very successfully, with our full support. I would like to thank him for his work and hope for further good cooperation in the future.
I hope you will help me to keep my promise, and I hope we will all meet again on the Action Day in 2012.
I hope, however, that the Commission will submit a report in September that sets out strategies on this issue.
I introduced an amendment to reduce the budget by 2.8%, which is the average rate of irregularities affecting the EU budget as reported by the European Court of Auditors.
I just want to sound the slight warning note that we must respect subsidiarity and national competences in this area and in this process.
I just wanted to say a brief goodbye. I will miss this Parliament tremendously. I will miss all the friends I have made here tremendously. I do not think there is a better place in Europe for the passion and the compassion that this Parliament can bring to bear. I am deeply grateful and, because I do not want my last goodbye to be a goodbye in English and because I do not want you to forget the Greek that you have learned in the past year and a half, I will tell you what I suggest we do. Let me hear again how we say 'in favour'.
I know it is difficult for you to carry out your work, Mrs Ashton, because you are on your own and it was not you who decided this - this is how the EEAS was set up - but the impression is being given that in the autumn, we thought Belarus was the most important issue, while today - a little like children who have become interested in something else - we are looking at North Africa.
I know that many people in Greece are living through a period of great hardship and uncertainty.
I know that the objective of the Agreement is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing through the implementation of effective port state measures, thereby ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and marine ecosystems.
I listened with particular interest to Mr Barroso both here in Brussels and in Palermo on the regional policies for the protection of Sicily and Lampedusa, which continues to see the arrival of boats which would otherwise be at the mercy of raging seas where more lives would be lost.
I look forward very much to hearing the outcome of your debates on our Green Paper, which I understand will be adopted in late summer. I can assure you that the enriching inputs given by the Carvalho, Merkies, Audy and Matias reports will be duly taken into account when preparing the legislative proposals.
I met an elderly lady whose husband was a taxi driver.
I mourn his death as both a colleague and a friend of his and I am going to ask President Buzek to send his family and the Spanish Government a message of heartfelt condolence and support, which I am sure that all of us here share.
I move on now to explain my vote on the Directive on Consumer Rights. I welcome the adoption of this directive, which constitutes a step forward in European integration and in the protection of consumer rights but, at the same time, I regret that the adoption of a number of articles of the directive involves taking protection away from many Spanish consumers and users who are going to find themselves deprived of certain rights that were already enshrined in Spanish law.
I must emphasise once again that at the same time regional policy has become the central and sustainable investment policy for all European regions.
I must express regret, however, over the fact that the Council has so stubbornly refused to introduce country of origin labelling and to harmonise size labelling. I am very disappointed with the approach of the Council, which deprives consumers of the right to find out before purchasing where a significant part of a product was made.
I must insist on how important it is to apply fairly the 'polluter pays' principle, as has also proved to be the case in the wake of the disaster in Japan.
I must refer, however, to what I have just heard regarding the protection of minorities under the Spanish constitution, which has been set up as an example to some other constitutions that have been mentioned by Mr Szájer. I cannot overlook this.
I must say that if we cannot understand the tough situation Member States are in today, we do not understand the reality for citizens.
I must stress the need for greater transparency for all funds earmarked for this purpose and, more importantly, for increasing the assessments of the impact which the DCI has among the population in those countries.
I myself am at this point involved in an opinion on data protection and the number of groups that have come to me with their views amazes me. I would like, if I were compelled to have a register, to record those who came to me as well, because in that way, we could have true transparency. A register of lobbyists officially, but also a record of those who lobbied us. That would create true transparency, greater credibility and ultimately greater trust.
I note that the Court of Auditors has once again drawn attention to a large volume of carryovers and cancellations of operational appropriations by several agencies in the financial year 2009. I also note the existence of unused budget lines and the high number of transfers in some of the agencies, and I would call on the agencies concerned to step up their efforts to improve financial and budgetary planning and programming.
I note the need to pay particular attention to the outermost regions, to regions with serious and permanent natural or demographic limitations, such as the most northerly regions with very low population density and islands, and to cross-border and mountain regions; this is because the resources and capabilities of these regions can play a significant role in the future competitiveness of the European Union.
I note, finally, that there are requests to limit the duration of the trade preferences to one year from the date on which the waiver takes effect. I think that would be very problematic.
I now come to the Sanchez-Schmid report on unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries. I would like to thank Parliament and, in particular, Ms Sanchez-Schmid, for this very good report. I am pleased to see that there is a strong convergence of views between your report and our analysis.
I now want to listen to what you parliamentarians have to say in order to understand the position of the European Parliament on this matter.
I particularly agree with the rapporteur's assertion that synergies and coordination do not imply one-size-fits-all solutions, but call for close strategic coordination between instruments, policies and actors in order to produce carefully designed interventions and programmes which take into account the territorial specificities and comparative advantages or special features of each region in an integrated place-based approach.
I particularly like the idea of the continuation of direct payments and the explicit removal of the historical reference values in paragraph 15 and the fairer distribution between Member States, and within Member States in the regions and nations within them, in paragraph 16.
I particularly welcome the call for at least 70% of budget funding to be spent on territorial cooperation in cross-border collaboration, on the one hand, and for the funding for territorial cooperation to be increased from a level of 2.5% in the current programming period to at least 7% of total budget funding in the next programming period.
I personally am in favour of extending de minimis aid on certain conditions: we must focus on small-scale fishermen, on small-scale and coastal fisheries; we must focus on fishermen who apply proper, sustainable fishing practices; and finally, we must focus on ensuring that financing does not result in an increase in fishing effort and these measures do not put the environmental and social viability of European fisheries at risk.
I propose that when main insolvency proceedings are begun against an employer who is in debt the receiver should be allowed within a six-month period to order the preservation of assets, with backdated effect, where the company has taken steps to move its funds.
I realise how difficult it is when in every Member State there are very different calls for what should be incorporated into the CAP reform, but one important matter is relevant here, and that, of course, is this matter of greening.
I really hope that some of our colleagues can have a second look at the text before simply agreeing to it on Wednesday. I hope we can send a clear signal to the Commission and thereby influence the negotiations, making it very clear that we want to exercise our powers as the European Parliament.
I really hope that, by the time of the inter-parliamentary assembly scheduled for June, we will succeed in having all these people released, including newspaper editor Eynulla Fatullayev, and that the government and the governing parties finally keep to their promises.
I refer to a very specific matter: personally, I was not at all surprised that the referendum and its result were followed by an increase in hostilities - almost - caused by the Sudanese institutions and authorities, particularly in the Abyei region.
I regret that he is hurling what I consider to be insults at me. I am sorry, Mr Preda, but I have never defended, here in this Chamber, or at any other time in my life, a single dictatorship anywhere in the world. I have always denounced all human rights abuses, wherever they are committed.
I regret that the Council has not yet participated in the agreement and joined the transparency register, as this affects the likelihood of achieving the necessary level of transparency at all stages of the EU legislative process. I would like to remind you that the level of transparency of political institutions is increasingly linked to its legitimacy.
I regret the inadequate investment in projects promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy resources for housing and for housing projects aimed at marginalised communities.
I repeat, it is a pity that we have not reached agreement because this regulation dealt not only with cloning and with how many generations and which products must be labelled, but also with many other points on which agreement has been reached, such as nanotechnology and foodstuffs coming from third countries, which were very important for consumers and for the agri-food industry, not only from the point of view of the internal market, but also from a health perspective and in terms of innovation.
I said yesterday to Minister Moallem, the Foreign Minister of Syria: You must allow immediate and unhindered access to humanitarian support and to the media.
I say this to the right: you chose to form a narrow majority with the eurosceptics, as you were free to do, in order to create a form of economic governance which I can tell you now is unfair and will be ineffective.
I say to you quite clearly - if there are dangerous bacteria on a cucumber or a lettuce that do not lead to death, that may be a good thing, but for me it is not enough to justify a compensation case.
I scrutinised the report very attentively and summarised its key points: (1) the scope of scrutiny (not only cost-benefit analysis, but an integrated approach); (2) the inclusion of stakeholders from all the policy areas while the methodology and final quality control should remain under the remit of the European institutions, with an increased consultation period from 8 to 12 weeks; (3) the revision of the interinstitutional common approach to impact assessment to encourage all the institutions to implement a common methodology on IAs.
I served four terms as a member of parliament for a region, one area of which, namely Naoussa, has one of the highest unemployment rates in the whole of Europe, as a result of the impact of globalisation of the textile industry.
I shall focus on transparency, on which I drafted a report.
I share his concerns at the level of antibiotic resistance being found in bacterial infections of livestock. I agree with him that there should be growing concern that there is evidence of overspill to the human population, where we are finding that the efficacy of many once-reliable antibiotics has declined significantly, thereby putting human health at risk.
I share the rapporteur's analysis in the report voted on today.
I should also like to express my satisfaction at the fact that the main messages of my report were adopted both in the extremely important motion for a resolution by the European Parliament on the future financial perspective of the European Union and in the report on the future of cohesion policy.
I should also like to say how grateful we are to you, Commissioner. I speak on behalf of all those who hold you in high esteem.
I should also like us to pay attention to the principles of allocating and auctioning spectrum, because it is not necessarily used in every case for commercial purposes and, hence, to generate profit. I am, of course, thinking of the cultural dimension, which has been pointed out, but also of spectrum use for public service purposes - we should actually have a discussion about civil protection services - and indeed for military purposes.
I should also mention that, if the summit leaders decide to go ahead with the option of a comprehensive bilateral legal framework, this should include both trade and investment relations and political relations and cooperation.
I should just like to make one remark to say that I regret the Council's reluctance to sign up to this common register.
I should like to adjourn the debate a moment to announce that today in the visitors' gallery we have Professor Dagmar Lieblová, President of Theresienstadt Martyrs Remembrance Association, from the Czech Republic, whom we welcome.
I should like to ask the Commission, therefore, if it does not think there is a case for triggering the European emergency clause and bringing forward the discussion on financial compensation.
I should like to conclude, Mr President, by raising the following points in response to some specific questions.
I should like to congratulate Mr Garriga Polledo on the excellent work he has carried out on the important matter of the future financial perspective.
I should like to emphasise something else: I believe that the effects that such a free trade agreement between two of the giants of international trade would have on the entire structure of global trade must be discussed in greater detail than has been the case heretofore.
I should like to emphasise what I consider to be this report's most significant step forward: the possibility of creating a system that is not just based on the sanctions aspect of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), but that, by contrast, enables the introduction of real incentives that lead to and develop a genuine will in the governments of the Member States to comply with the rules laid down in the SGP.
I should like to express my deep sympathy with European fishers, whose salaries have been directly affected by an increase in oil prices, which has seriously exacerbated the economic fragility linked to the irregular nature of activity in this sector. I consider it essential to introduce mechanisms that promote the boosting of prices paid at the production stage, whilst keeping prices paid at the final consumption stage as low as possible. I am therefore voting for the motion for a resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), which duly emphasises the above points.
I should like to express my pride at the European Parliament's broadly favourable view in support of the appointment of the new President of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi.
I should like to mention the importance of video's exponential growth as an element of communication between different people, and between different institutions and companies.
I should like to offer my congratulations on the excellent work carried out by Mr Klinz. I call on the rating agencies to shed further light on how they determine their sovereign ratings, while also asking the sector to explain their methodologies and why their ratings diverge from the forecasts of the main international financial institutions.
I should like to point out that the European Parliament's main positions have already been formulated and approved by plenary in a special chapter of the resolution on the future financial perspective of the European Union as regards cohesion policy.
I should like to say something to you as a Portuguese.
I should like to welcome the introduction of a mechanism of sanctions for correcting macroeconomic imbalances, in line with what is happening at the moment with the Stability and Growth Pact rules.
I should like, therefore, to congratulate the rapporteur and get behind her call for a more ambitious Commission Green Paper that leads to the appearance of a true Internal Market, making it possible to create jobs and guarantee greater social cohesion.
I should now like to comment principally on the proposals to reform the Staff Regulations.
I should say that my group aligns itself neither with one side nor with the other, but simply with the side of justice and of reconciliation. I believe that there can be no reconciliation, in those countries, like Sri Lanka, but there are certainly many others, which have experienced atrocious wars, unless justice is done.
I should stress the important role played by the EGF in reintegrating redundant workers into the labour market. I call for an assessment to be carried out of the long-term integration of these workers into the labour market, as a direct result of the measures funded by the EGF.
I should therefore like to advise Mr Verhofstadt, because he has obviously been misled, that on these two issues, which form the cornerstone of the reforms, Nea Dimokratia has not only agreed; it was Nea Dimokratia that made the proposals.
I sincerely hope that the Council reaches an agreement so that these two countries can become part of the privileged circle of Schengen States.
I spoke to Parliament in May about the Commission's migration package, which sets recent and future policy initiatives in a framework that allows the EU and its Member States to manage asylum, migration and mobility of third-country nationals in a secure environment.
I stand with the poor farmers, trade unionists and workers of India who oppose the FTA as it will mean a further undermining of living standards and working conditions for large parts of the Indian working class, in particular, those that work in the large informal sector.
I still believe that some sort of European Arrest Warrant is a necessary tool to fight crime and terrorism across the Union, particularly given the huge free movement of people now moving between Member States, including - sadly - criminals. I also believe that the number of errors or miscarriages is relatively small - but still too many.
I stressed earlier on, in my introduction, how difficult it was to reach this compromise.
I strongly believe that the European Parliament will adopt this report tomorrow and that the Council will act accordingly as soon as possible.
I strongly believe this report indicates the need for the Commission to undertake a thorough spending review in order to identify possible savings which would reduce pressure on the budget during this period of austerity.
I strongly believe, Commissioner, that the Venice Commission's report will confirm that these breaches have taken place. I would ask you the following then: what will the European Commission want and be able to do about this? Finally, I want to ask the following question, especially to the German and French MEPs among you, here in Strasbourg, which is the symbol of the historical reconciliation between Germany and France, and which our European Union has been built on: can you allow the demons of nationalism to be let loose in Europe without destroying our European Union project?
I strongly support the amendment of certain elements of Regulation (EC) No 1215/2009 in order to permit the extension of its validity to 31 December 2015 and make certain adjustments consequent to the entry into force of bilateral agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia.
I strongly support the call issued yesterday by Parliament to the International Ice Hockey Federation for Belarus to lose its right to host the 2014 World Championships unless it frees all its political prisoners.
I suggest that we need to suspend the entry process to the Schengen scheme for Bulgaria and Romania as a precaution, not least in view of the foreseeably enormous pressure on the external borders of these two countries, which are becoming the holes in the Swiss cheese that is the European Union system regarding the entry of illegal immigrants.
I support spending on the promotion of accessible artistic and cultural events which can enrich the lives of the population; this is why is supported the LUX film prize, despite misgivings on the seemingly large budget spent on this particular award.
I support the 'polluter pays' principle and we should under no circumstances be shirking our responsibilities.
I support the comprehensive approach to innovation policy and believe that together, we must establish a strategic and integrated European Union innovation policy that is geared to practical adaptation.
I support the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the participation of the Republic of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction because the number of deaths, compared with last year, is falling for all drugs except heroin, and progress is being achieved as a whole in the fight against drug use.
I support the introduction of exceptional trade measures for countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process.
I support the principle of helping Pakistan boost its economy following the floods in July 2010.
I support the proposal to introduce a combination of the principles of maximum and minimum harmonisation, thereby allowing consumers to retain the rights they have gained through national legal provisions.
I support the report of Georgios Stavrakakis on the performance, financial management and control of EU agencies because mainly it stresses the need to encourage the agencies to develop, and then regularly update, a comprehensive situation outlining their financial circuits and the responsibilities of the financial and operational actors.
I support the report on the draft Council Regulation concerning the extension of the scope of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro area Member States.
I support the report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities because I believe that it truly reflects what has been achieved, as well as existing problems.
I support the report reviewing the Small Business Act as it aims to improve access to credit and access to the market for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). At this time of crisis for European businesses, we need to give assistance to SMEs, enabling them to increase their abilities and know-how, asking them to support management programmes designed to implement research, development and innovation.
I support the resolution on the renewal of the protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Mauritania because the agreement is based on the principle of surplus, which is compatible with the EU's sustainable fishing strategy.
I support the waiver of Bruno Gollnisch's immunity so that he can stand trial for the offence of incitement to racial hatred.
I support this decision because it makes a significant contribution towards strengthening transparency by approving the conclusion of an agreement between Parliament and the Commission on the establishment of a common transparency register.
I support this own-initiative report because it supports the creation of a European Order for the Preservation of Assets and a European Order for the Disclosure of Assets.
I support this proposal for the committee to continue its work on this important document on the basis of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading, and I hope that the Council will also take a favourable approach towards promoting access to information about textile products.
I support this report as it is important to recognise the valuable contribution of early childhood education and how crucial it is to achieving the EU's 2020 strategy.
I support this report because this proposal involves no more than a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
I support this report in view of the new elements that have been introduced by the Council, especially with regard to earmarking, greater transparency and incentives for fleet renewal, vehicle capacity and the possibility of more effective variation of infrastructure.
I support this report on the conclusion of an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament and the Commission on a common transparency register.
I support this report on the future of credit rating agencies (CRAs). The recent financial crisis has highlighted that there are major problems with this business, such as over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings by CRAs.
I support this report, especially what it says about the Special Report of the Court of Auditors on the reform of the sugar sector.
I support this report, which calls on the Member States to ensure that people, at different times of life, have access to vocational education and training which is tailored to their needs that will facilitate and improve their participation in the labour market and in society more generally.
I support this report, which recommends several concrete actions, including the creation of an environmental index, more timely publication of environmental and social data, more accurate reporting on social disparities and extending the system of national accounts to include environmental and social issues.
I support this resolution on the proposed International Labour Organisation convention on domestic workers. A significant part of domestic work is undeclared, precarious and underpaid, and domestic workers, mostly women, are vulnerable to abuse, especially when working abroad.
I supported Mr Garriga Polledo's report because I found its general outlines justified in the light of the challenges that the European Union is to face over the coming years.
I supported Mr Mitchell's report because I believe we have to increase the participation of parliaments in developing countries when drawing up strategy papers for these countries, for the poverty eradication strategy for instance.
I supported the Zahradil report because I think that Council Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 on proof of origin for certain textile products has served its purpose.
I supported the nomination of Hans Gustaf Wessberg as a Member of the Court of Auditors because he has over 30 years of professional experience of high level management in public institutions as well as private enterprises in Sweden. A large part of his career has been devoted to improving conditions for private enterprises in Sweden, as manager in organisations representing industry interests in public life.
I supported the proposed report because I think that creating credit rating agencies will boost competition in this sector, which is a prerequisite for enhancing quality, reducing information costs and, last but not least, increasing the relevant agencies' accountability.
I supported the recommendation because the European Union must send out a strong message against illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing.
I supported the report by Alexander Graf Lambsdorff because I think that we need to foster greater cohesion between the Member States' positions and enhance our ability to negotiate with other regional groups.
I supported the report by our fellow Member, Mr Falbr, because I believe that the Union should promote the highest labour and social standards in third countries to maintain its credibility in international trade and to build strong ties with the main trade partners.
I supported the report on the development of the common security and defence policy following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.
I supported the report on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the first radio spectrum policy programme. I believe that a common radio frequency spectrum policy will provide European Union Member States with new possibilities for developing information and communications technology industries.
I supported this report because I believe that it will above all give greater security to consumers buying online by providing better prior consumer information.
I supported this report by voting in favour because I believe that we need rules during the transitional period to ensure legal certainty and avoid conflicts and gaps in the law.
I supported this report, which precedes the Commission communication on CSR. I also welcome the work done by my colleague, Richard Howitt, at committee stage to produce a report that promotes the positive work that corporate social responsibility can do at European level.
I supported this resolution as I believe the specific issue of safeguarding equal treatment and fair competition on public procurement markets in the EU and in third countries urgently needs more political attention.
I supported this resolution on the ILO convention on Decent Work for Domestic Workers.
I supported today's report calling for a joint register of lobbyists and interest groups to be set up. This is a first step towards greater transparency in both the European Parliament and Commission. A 'transparency register' will improve ease of access for citizens wishing to find specific information regarding which organisations and individuals have contact with both MEPs and Commission officials.
I suppose it is very easy with hindsight to talk about what could or should have been done or what we did not do, but now, with the benefit of that hindsight, we could put mechanisms in place to ensure that this never happens again.
I take a very positive view of the extremely open and realistic assessment of the individual common security and defence policy (CSDP) missions, of the statements on women and security, on disarmament and on the human rights clause in anti-terrorism measures, and of the clear reference to the decision not to mix civilian and military operations.
I take this opportunity to express my opposition to a unilateral increase in the European target for greenhouse gas emission reductions to beyond 20% by 2020, given the lack of a global climate agreement involving all the major emitters.
I thank everyone for their support and once again, Mr Tajani, thank you for your support and I hope that we will have the results of the study as soon as possible. I also hope that the President-in-Office will succeed in persuading the Council that we can set to work in a positive spirit.
I thank the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, for his excellent report, which fits in with the recent debate on the implementation of the Schengen Agreement.
I thank you for your condemnation of the massacre in Camp Ashraf on 8 April 2011. I strongly suggest that, in this case, you follow the clear message of the European Parliament from April 2009: we need a clear and convincing message that the EU really cares about the lives of 34 unarmed members of the Iranian opposition and will no longer tolerate the brutal crushing of their liberties and dignity. I ask the Commission to take the lead in the proposed resettlement issue.
I therefore advocate respect for the results of the referendum as an expression of the democratic will of the people of South Sudan, and I urge Sudan and South Sudan to commit themselves actively to promoting democratic governance and establishing lasting peace, security and prosperity in both countries. I consider the provision of external aid very important and I welcome the Council's 23 May 2011 decision to allocate EUR 200 million to development cooperation in South Sudan, with the aim of contributing to the autonomy of local communities, and of attending to the basic needs of the people and to the non-existence of human resources and infrastructure.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur on the need to improve the transparency of estimates and responsibility of projects; to strengthen their procurement authorisation at the financing decision and work-programme level; to correct failings in the recruitment of personnel, and increase its objectivity and transparency; and to implement and comply with the Financial Regulation to which they are subject.
I therefore agree with the rapporteur, Mr Hökmark, that we absolutely must stick to the timetable that has been set for freeing up the spectrum.
I therefore also regard it as legitimate to ask whether the analysis promised by the European Commission, concerning a reduction of the administrative burden to 25% of its current level, is available yet. I also agree with the proposals to the effect that both the EU institutions and the Member States should be guided by these principles when creating new legislation or revising existing legislation.
I therefore ask for the adjournment in order that we can conclude this or leave the door open to concluding it, with a first-reading agreement in July.
I therefore ask the Commission how it intends to proceed and whether it intends to submit a proposal to remove the Member States' discretion in the transposition of Articles 3 and 4 of the framework decision, concerning the grounds for mandatory non-execution and optional non-execution.
I therefore believe it essential that funding for cohesion policy at least remain at the same levels, along with funding for the common agricultural policy (CAP). It is also important to make progress towards an MFF, more than 80% of whose funds do not come from national budgets.
I therefore believe that it is important to reinvest in already existing mobility and education/training programmes, and to establish European-level minimum conditions for work experience placements, since these should not be seen as employment, but rather as the acquisition of practical skills.
I therefore believe that this is an area where, on the one hand, maximum harmonisation may be useful, but, on the other, minimum harmonisation may also be adopted, depending on which is more suited to a given type of contract.
I therefore call on Commissioner Dalli - who I know is very willing - to table a Commission proposal incorporating our positions as soon as possible, so as to allow this House to approve the regulation on cloning.
I therefore call on the Commission not just to improve the monitoring mechanisms, but also to adopt the measures necessary for wider-ranging data collection, and for the series of incentives encouraging best practices in this area to be included in the common agricultural policy legislative package that is being drawn up.
I therefore cannot but stress what thousands of European citizens and taxpayers are wondering: what use is Europe if it cannot solve the economic problems of the continent, if it cannot speak with a single voice on matters of foreign policy, and if it squanders money? I hope that what Commissioner Tajani has said on several occasions comes true. I hope that the review of the SME code really is able to simplify red tape, ensure access to and recovery of credit, and facilitate internalisation.
I therefore congratulate the Court of Auditors on its excellent performance in 2009 and agree with the rapporteur with regard to all his conclusions.
I therefore consider it essential that the European Union adopt a true innovation strategy, taking into account the Europe 2020 strategy of smart specialisation, with a view to reinforcing support for research, development and innovation (RDI) as a key element of the Union's future, extending it into all the areas, sectors of activity and social agents of which it is comprised.
I therefore do not believe that what you have presented is good, Mrs Malmström, because you have failed to quote Article 78(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). I do not know whether you are familiar with it. Article 78(3) of TFEU states that in the event of one or more Member States being confronted by a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries, the Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may adopt provisional measures for the benefit of the Member State(s) concerned - after consulting the European Parliament, by the way.
I therefore hope that the lessons that inescapably emerge will, in fact, be learnt. I hope that the Council of Agriculture Ministers will be able not just to provide compensation for the injured parties, but also to establish a response protocol that takes on board the lessons extracted from this unfortunate experience.
I therefore hope that we here will be casting a vote in favour, that we will support this package, but also that we will give ourselves the opportunity to start a final round of negotiations with the Council in order to strengthen this point further.
I therefore reject the idea of capping direct payments, since this is a move which will reduce the efficiency of agriculture throughout the European Union.
I therefore support the creation of new instruments and increased funding for measures designed to protect the EU's forests, particularly in order to address the new challenges brought about by climate change.
I therefore support the development of a European structure composed of common goals and values that includes shared rights and structures, which will contribute to coming up with adequate early-childhood education and care services; these must benefit from effective and equitable financing.
I therefore think it would be a good idea to tackle this problem at the summit as well, including asking Russia to lift this disproportionate and unjustified import ban on European Union vegetables immediately, which, as such, is out of line with the principles established by the World Trade Organisation (WTO), especially considering that Russia is a candidate for accession to the WTO.
I therefore think that if Europe does not want to fall in on itself and die, it must decide to invest more heavily in research and innovation.
I therefore voted in favour, because I am convinced that it would be useful to make an amendment to the Commission's proposal, achieving minimum harmonisation and at the same time guaranteeing a high-level service to consumers.
I therefore welcome the Member States' undertaking to reassign part of this revenue to the TEN-T, a major project designed to guarantee Europe's territorial cohesion and to improve access in regions such as those of the Alps, where the infrastructure is not sufficient to ensure a modal shift from road transport to other forms of transport.
I therefore welcome the adoption of this report, which represents a major step forward in consumer protection. I also welcome the option taken by the Council of restricting this directive to door-to-door and Internet sales - a market that is expanding significantly, but in which consumers still feel a little lost - and I approve of the simplification measures adopted, not least the possibility of consumers, but not companies, rescinding contracts by telephone.
I therefore welcome two amendments tabled by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament calling for Parliament and the Council to co-decide on matters relating to nuclear energy use and endorsing the fundamental ban on waste exports to third countries, a ban which demonstrates Parliament's determination to shoulder its responsibilities.
I therefore wholeheartedly endorse and encourage the initiative that aims to reduce the school drop-out rate to 10%, and to increase the percentage of people with post-secondary education from 31% to 40% by 2020.
I think President Sarkozy's idea was an excellent one because the Internet is a global phenomenon.
I think it is a good idea as well to enable small enterprises to register themselves as European private companies, thereby reducing the administrative burdens and, at the same time, realising smart regulation is an extremely timely issue. A high priority in this is spreading the 'only once' principle across Europe and examining whether the regulatory framework of certain policy areas is as it should be and, if it is not, what changes are required.
I think it is important too that we look at what we are really doing on CSDP; let us not mess around with descriptions that are not true.
I think it is very good to be able to stand here, not only as a non-attached Member, but as someone who, with this opinion on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs - it was not a shadow report, but a supplementary opinion that is even more comprehensive than that of the lead committee, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - is able to represent these positions that we have set out with a vote of 37 to 0. In specific terms, this means that we want - as I put it - to move towards a system of European sustainability statistics, nicely abbreviated to ESS.
I think research and innovation are fundamental contributions to a fairer, more redistributive and more sustainable development model, so we cannot let some factors fall by the wayside.
I think that Europe's farmers are entitled to decent incomes, which, along with ensuring food security, provide a basic justification for preserving the CAP.
I think that European citizens need to have a better understanding of the cohesion policy's objectives. A strong Europe, which is a Europe that will cope with the global competitive environment, is achieved by maintaining the cohesion policy as a key element in EU policies, aimed at achieving balanced development in every region. I want to insist on maintaining a significant proportion of the future budget outlook for the cohesion policy.
I think that I have covered most of the other issues. I am certainly willing to continue the discussion on this agreement with Parliament and the Committee on International Trade, the more so now that we are reaching the end game in this discussion. I am not going to pronounce on the exact timeframe for coming to a final agreement.
I think that accession to the Schengen area is not a gift being offered to Romania, but rather recognition of its merits and efforts, and will be an obvious asset to the security of the EU's external borders.
I think that establishing a European intermodal transport system, based on the TEN-T network and interconnecting it with national road, rail and inland waterway projects, is vital to ensuring territorial, economic and social cohesion.
I think that supporting the convergence requirements of less developed areas must remain a priority in the forthcoming programming period so that fair access to the cohesion policy instruments can be guaranteed.
I think that the European Union and Russia must intensify their negotiations on establishing a partnership and on introducing a comprehensive agreement concerning the political, economic and social system and also taking account of all the issues associated with democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.
I think that the European Union needs a strong and effective security and defence policy to prevent conflicts, protect its citizens' security and reaffirm its basic values, by making its contribution to supporting international law, the promotion of respect for human rights and democratic values throughout the whole world.
I think that the economic sanctions must be extended against Belarus, applying to the state firms in this country which play an important role in shaping the region.
I think that the income generated from the charge on users of the infrastructure and from the charge based on external costs must be used to support the trans-European road network, improve road safety and provide safe parking areas, which are an absolute necessity for compliance with the applicable social legislation.
I think that the proposals in this package are not ambitious enough, as they are only geared towards austerity and curtailing citizens' social rights.
I think that the review of this Seventh Framework Programme is absolutely crucial. I cannot stress enough the importance of issues like transparency, simplification and redistribution, which are essential, and are clearly outlined in this report and in the positions Parliament has been adopting.
I think that there is just one point that has not yet been made here today and that is the need to acknowledge that Europe is now some way behind in terms of research and innovation.
I think that this inharmonious result in the final structure of the package is down to a difference of opinion about the origins and nature of the crisis.
I think that we have reached this conclusion because, with the current turmoil in the Middle East, it has been realised that we had forgotten all about the cultural dimension for decades: for example, in the European Union's relations with Syria.
I think that we must provide support to Member States and regions by encouraging synergy between structural, social and rural policies.
I think that, in this way, we will ensure that the future common agricultural policy, which is a sectoral policy, provides multi-sectoral responses, and thus that the budget which is to be allocated to the common agricultural policy will demonstrate and provide a genuine European added value. I think that, in this way, we can justify a substantial budget for the common agricultural policy, and a budget which is consistent with the objectives that we are setting for this policy.
I think that, overall, there is a feeling on both sides that an EU-Japan FTA has the potential to become a true win-win for both sides.
I think the primary concern can be summarised as the one underlying the impression that what is certainly a very large political majority, a two-thirds majority, but nonetheless a circumstantial political majority in the Hungarian Parliament, has succeeded in forcing a constitutional reform that places constraints on the achievement of political pluralism and, consequently, on the possibility of alternating between different political projects under the same set of rules of play. I think that is why it has caused concern, from the point of view of its concordance with the principles enshrined in Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty on European Union and with the political dimension of the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
I think there is a political will to do this but it needs to be done in a coordinated manner and this is where an effort has been initiated by the Commission: Commissioner Malmström is working on the matter with the Member States, and I hope the European Council later this month will confirm our thinking.
I think these agencies are instrumental in delivering the Europe 2020 strategy and progress towards the headline targets we have agreed. I very much agree that developing skills and vocational training is one of the key challenges we are facing, as was stressed in the discussion.
I think this is a European issue, not a question of which Member States have nuclear industries and which do not: it is an issue for the whole of Europe, and Europe desperately needs good news. I must tell you, sincerely, that one of those items of good news is guaranteeing the public that we are taking care of their safety.
I think this is certainly a far-reaching proposal; it is an ambitious proposal and requires important decisions to be made in the Member States, and we would ask them to rise to the challenge it entails.
I think this resolution on the EU-India Free Trade Agreement should be rejected.
I think, Lady Ashton, that our institution - the European Parliament - is your natural ally in the battle involved in implementing the Treaty of Lisbon.
I totally agree that the recommendations of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should be taken into consideration as I think that the proposal in question is simply limited to a straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
I trust that I have answered the questions satisfactorily. I also trust that I have convinced you that the fiscal, financial and structural measures in the Memorandum are vital if Greece is to come out of the crisis. I hope I have allayed the fears some of you may have about the failure to observe the principle of subsidiarity.
I understand that over 400 petitions relating to abuse of business directories have been received by the European Parliament.
I understand the logic of compromise, but the current text destroys the one which resulted from the first reading and was voted for by an overwhelming majority.
I urge this House to support the work of the CMP, and to support Written Declaration 10 which is humanitarian in its objectives and seeks to bring peace and remembrance and reconciliation to these families.
I very much appreciate my fellow member Mr Chatzimarkakis's approach. I think that he has done a brilliant job of handling this discharge exercise.
I very much share the concern of the Russian Government and I would like to see the Latvian Republic prohibiting imports of vegetables until the dangerous infection is eliminated completely.
I very much support his desire to legislate so as to see Europe meet the technological challenges in this sector and maintain a leading position in the world.
I view the assessment made by the Court of Auditors in these special reports positively, because it is through these reports that we are able to access more clearly the information relating to how funds are spent, and also the need to reassess or adapt programmes and projects.
I voted against Amendment 39 in this report and, by extension, for Amendment 62. I think that an intermediary category is needed for regions for the duration of the next programming period, with the only proviso being that the allocation of funds earmarked for these regions does not affect the allocations intended for achieving the convergence and competitiveness objectives.
I voted against Mrs Wallis's report because the optional instrument envisaged, based on a regulation, basically marks the first step towards harmonising contract law in Member States. I think that such harmonisation, even to a minimal extent, is inconceivable at the present stage in view of the different way contractual relations are regulated in Member States.
I voted against a part of paragraph 36 because the provision it contains is, to say the least, unrealistic. I do not think that we should ban construction on forest land which has been affected by fire because it is actually impossible for this land to be used for other purposes. I do not think that we should present cases of abuse as the general rule and harm the property rights of the forests' owners who have already been affected by a forest fire.
I voted against a report that proposes an optional legal instrument for contract law, effectively laying the foundations for a future body of European civil law, to take precedence over domestic civil laws.
I voted against because I think that it is possible to find a more suitable person for the position offered, from a professional point of view.
I voted against granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the Council because the Council has refused to respond to questions from Parliament on this topic and has failed to provide the essential documents that Parliament has requested. I am therefore in favour of postponing the 2009 discharge.
I voted against paragraph 20 because I do not believe that the time is yet ripe for the EU to have a single seat on the United Nations Security Council.
I voted against the Balzani report on the mandate for the trilogue negotiations from the Budget committee because it wants to increase the EU budget for 2012 by 3.7% for commitments and 4.9% for payments. I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2011 levels because I firmly believe it is a reduction that is needed, and their stand represents a weak starting point for negotiations
I voted against the Balzani report on the mandate for the trilogue negotiations from the Budget committee because it wants to increase the EU budget for 2012 by 3.7% for commitments and 4.9% for payments. I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2011 levels because I firmly believe it is a reduction that is needed, and their stand represents a weak starting point for negotiations.
I voted against the El Khadraoui report on charging heavy goods vehicles as the proposal allows tariff barriers to be introduced, which will increase the costs for freight operators in the peripheral Member States.
I voted against the European Parliament resolution on the negotiations for the free trade agreement between the EU and India.
I voted against the Garriga Polledo report from the SURE committee because it wants to increase the EU budget for the period 2014-2020 by 5%. I could not vote in favour of the Conservative Party amendment to freeze the budget at 2013 levels because I firmly believe it is a reduction that is needed, and their stand represents a weak starting point for negotiations.
I voted against the Niebler report on impact assessments. UKIP supports the concept of impact assessments but only if they are truly independent, have real teeth (such that the Commission has to take note of them) and are conducted at the national level to avoid producing a bland one-size-fits-all which will not enable national governments to assess the impact on their countries with sufficient accuracy.
I voted against the amendments to Mr Garriga Polledo's report calling for intermediate categories of regions, or regions with per capita gross domestic product between 75% and 90% of European Union GDP, to be introduced for the next financial programming period.
I voted against the application of an external dimension of social policy, promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility.
I voted against the authorisation to discharge the 2009 general budget of the European Medicines Agency. I did so because, as reported by the Court of Auditors, there were some irregularities in the transactions on which the accounts are based, which cause concerns about the correct use of funds. I am therefore in favour of postponing the closure of accounts for the financial year 2009 so that further management checks can be carried out.
I voted against the full application of the Schengen measures in Romania and Bulgaria.
I voted against the legislative resolution which allows Parliament to grant EUR 46 million to the Georgian Government.
I voted against the motion for a European Parliament resolution on establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation with developing countries, areas and regions because of the wish expressed by the motion in respect of the management of illegal immigration.
I voted against the motion for a resolution on misleading business directories as the UK operates its own misleading marketing regulations via the Office of Fair Trading, which controls the regulation of open and honest trade and contracts within the UK. However, such regulations do not encompass misleading contracts in other Member States.
I voted against the potential adoption of EU harmonisation of credit rating agencies as the standards may vary, and necessarily so, between Member States.
I voted against the proposals to discharge the Commission of its obligation to report on its expenditure because the report was unclear. I did vote in favour of the motion for a resolution, as the general idea of cost efficiency in the EU is raised many times. I am in favour of cutting costs in relation to the Commission and its agencies.
I voted against the provision of external aid to South Sudan of EUR 200 million in development cooperation in order to assist South Sudan to cope with the numerous humanitarian and socio-economic challenges in a context of reduced governance capacity and political fragility.
I voted against the removal of the Parliamentary immunity of Bruno Gollnisch because: 1. I believe in free speech and the words complained of were not incitements to violence and were not abusive or insulting.
I voted against the report on the charging of heavy goods vehicles as I believe that levying charges for the use of infrastructure could have negative repercussions for the European economy, particularly in outlying countries.
I voted against the resolution tabled by the European right, as it promotes an ultraliberal vision of the EU's trade relations with India.
I voted against the trade relationship between the EU and Canada as I feel any BIT could undermine the Commonwealth negotiation between UK and Canada.
I voted against the waiver of Bruno Gollnisch's immunity because the explanatory statement given by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which recommended the waiver to plenary, was entirely arbitrary.
I voted against this report as I strongly oppose the programme of crippling austerity measures which is being driven through the European Union by the centre-right.
I voted against this report, which draws cultural goods into a logic of the market and competition.
I voted for Mr Hökmark's draft report, which supports freeing up the 800 MHz band for mobile services between now and January 2013 and sets some very ambitious objectives such as freeing up 1 200 MHz for mobile data traffic by 2015.
I voted for Mrs Auconie's report. I welcome this proposal to extend the scope of application to the cross-border transport of euro cash by road.
I voted for Mrs Fraga's recommendation on the draft Council decision on the approval of the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing. I voted in favour because the content of the initiative will be a crucial contribution to the current global struggle against illegal fishing.
I voted for Mrs Sanchez-Schmid's report on the potential of the European cultural and creative industries, which has not yet been fully unlocked.
I voted for adoption of the agreement, because it is of mutual benefit to the interests of the parties in the fisheries sector.
I voted for discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Joint Undertaking for the implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines for the financial year 2009. I urge the Joint Undertaking to complete the implementation of its internal controls and financial information system as a matter of urgency.
I voted for discharge of the implementation of the budget of the Community Fisheries Control Agency for the financial year 2009 after seeing the analysis the Court of Auditors is undertaking, which states that its actions are legal and regular.
I voted for discharge of the implementation of the budget of the European Railway Agency for the financial year 2009, because Parliament granted its director discharge in May.
I voted for the Coelho report on applying the Schengen acquis in Romania and Bulgaria and I welcome the realistic attitude and good faith shown by all my fellow Members who also voted for this report.
I voted for the Consumer Rights Directive today because I believe that it will simplify and improve the existing regulations in the area of consumer protection.
I voted for the European Parliament's resolution on the Small Business Act Review as there are still further important steps to be taken to facilitate the proper operation of SMEs in the EU.
I voted for the Manders report on regulations covering the labelling of textile products. I am very happy that Parliament, on the occasion of this vote at second reading, has reintroduced a series of amendments, despite opposition from the Council.
I voted for the draft resolution because I welcome the 'Single Market Act' initiative, and especially the legislative measures enabling small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to make use of all the advantages of the Single Market, such as the European rules for venture capital funds, the revised VAT regulations and the simplification of the directives on accounting.
I voted for the joint motion for a resolution on the EU-Russia Summit as I think that relations with Russia need to be strengthened, especially in the area of energy security.
I voted for the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in favour of Belgium because I believe this instrument represents a valuable resource to support workers who find themselves in difficulty on account of the economic crisis.
I voted for the motion for a resolution on antibiotic resistance because I believe that the Commission and the Member States need to adopt measures to address the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in animals, given that the use of antibiotics in animal feed also contributes to antibiotic resistance in humans.
I voted for the motion for a resolution on the European fisheries sector crisis due to the rise in oil prices, as it has affected the economic viability of the fisheries sector, with a direct impact on fishers' incomes.
I voted for the report because I agree that the Commission should publish a report on the application of this regulation three years after it comes into force, and then every five years subsequently. I agree that this report should assess, inter alia, the effectiveness of the regulation, the progress made towards ensuring closer coordination between economic policies, and sustained convergence of the behaviour of the Member States' economies, pursuant to the Treaty.
I voted for the report because I agree that the Member States should establish an authoritatively scrutinised, effective medium-term budgetary framework providing for the adoption of a fiscal planning horizon of at least four years to ensure that national fiscal planning is part of a multiannual fiscal planning perspective.
I voted for the report because I agree that, in order to ensure closer coordination of economic policy and sustained convergence of the behaviours of Member States' economies, the Council should go ahead with multilateral supervision as an integral part of the European Semester for the coordination of economic policy, in line with the objectives and requirements provided for in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Parliament shall be duly involved in the European Semester, in order to increase transparency, ownership and accountability of the decisions taken, specifically through economic dialogue. I agree that the Economic and Financial Committee, the Economic Policy Committee, the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee should be consulted within the framework of the European Semester wherever deemed appropriate, and that the relevant stakeholders, in particular the social partners, should be involved in the European Semester as regards the main political issues, wherever appropriate, in accordance with the TFEU, with the law and with national policies.
I voted for the report because I agree that, when it exceeds the reference value, the ratio of the government debt to gross domestic product is to be considered sufficiently diminishing and approaching the reference value at a satisfactory pace in accordance with Article 126(2)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) if the differential with respect to the reference value has decreased over the previous three years at an average rate of one twentieth per year as a benchmark, following an assessment made over a three-year period for which there are data.
I voted for the report because the transmission of pathogenic bacteria carrying AMR genes constitutes a particular threat to people, through the intake of said bacteria and/or through daily contact with animals. I believe that commitment to research is essential, as it contributes to the development of antimicrobials as an effective tool in the fight against diseases afflicting both people and animals.
I voted for the report by Mr Garriga Polledo because I believe that in the future, financial instruments should be efficient, strengthen cohesion and prepare the European Union for the challenges of the global market. I agree with the content of the text, although there are two points that I did not agree with and which I opposed: the tax on financial transactions and the amendments to introduce the 'intermediate category'. I do not believe that a reference to the tax on financial transactions should be included in this report. A debate about this tax is important, but it requires in-depth analysis.
I voted for the report drafted by María Muñiz De Urquiza because the European Union's presence in multilateral organisations is one of the guiding principles of its foreign policy.
I voted for the report drafted by Mr Lambsdorff because I think that the EU is creating a new identity for itself on the global stage at the moment. I should remind you of the lengthy period of cooperation between the two international organisations, as well as of the EU's involvement in numerous projects launched by the UN. I must mention at this point the commitment made by European leaders to achieve the Millennium Development Goals.
I voted for the report on GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world, by Mrs Rosbach, because I believe that gross domestic product is no longer a sufficient, appropriate indicator for measuring progress in a changing world, and it is therefore necessary to develop more comprehensive indicators that would provide a more reliable knowledge base.
I voted for the report on Innovation Union as it highlighted the importance of innovation in terms of laying the foundations for a sustainable, competitive economic model and creating new jobs in the European Union.
I voted for the report on discharge in respect of the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2009, in relation to the European Parliament. I should like to stress that, in the section on major changes in budget management during 2009, I voted for item 5 because I understand that the general expenditure allowance paid into our accounts must be handled transparently in all cases and must be used for the purposes intended.
I voted for the report on discharge of the European Parliament budget 2009, since it contributes to scrutiny of how funds are used by the European institutions. I believe that it would be useful to review the European Parliament budget in the long term, in order to reduce costs and create resources for the efficient functioning of the Parliament in the context of its increased competences arising from the Treaty of Lisbon.
I voted for the report on the common agricultural policy towards 2020: meeting the food, natural resources and territorial challenges of the future, because it tables proposals that respond to new challenges like food security, environmental protection and climate change, whilst simultaneously ensuring greater territorial balance in Europe's rural areas.
I voted for the report on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, because I believe there is a need for a responsible strategy and adequate means to respond to all nuclear waste, whether from energy production, from scientific research, or from medicine.
I voted for the report on the mandate for the trialogue on the 2012 Draft Budget, because the European Union budget should foster recovery from the economic and social crisis in the Member States, by promoting growth, employment and the investment that is critical to the realisation of the Europe 2020 strategy's goals.
I voted for the report on the new Multiannual Financial Framework because it introduces the option of applying a financial transaction tax at European level.
I voted for the resolution because the Europe 2020 programme considers research and innovation to be central for emerging from the crisis by means of smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
I voted for the resolution on EU-Canada trade relations because it highlights the need to include social and environmental issues in the future Economic and Trade Agreement between the European Union and Canada.
I voted for the resolution on credit rating agencies because I believe that a new European rating agency is required, which will introduce an alternative method of operation and more competition in this sector.
I voted for the resolution on the Innovation Union because, apart from other things, I believe that we must adopt measures both at the European and national levels for improving the entrepreneurial skills and professional training of Europeans by incorporating business studies, creativity and innovation into all areas of education.
I voted for this Report but am concerned by the Court of Auditors' findings that several agencies had deficiencies in procurement procedures. I call on the agencies to strengthen their internal controls to make sure that contracts and procurement procedures are correctly applied.
I voted for this initiative because Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when they joined the EU in 2007.
I voted for this motion for a resolution because it has clearly pointed out the current situation of misleading business practices, which are already against EU law, and that the international dimension of the fraud makes it difficult for the victims to pursue and fight against the fraudsters. I believe that vulnerable small businesses and professionals need to be protected from the misleading business directories, and thus the EP and the EU as a whole must show that European law is there for everyone to follow and respect.
I voted for this motion for a resolution which supports the dignity, welfare and development of every person as values which ought to be the main objectives of economic development.
I voted for this nomination for the President of the European Central Bank (ECB), given the candidate's skills and the extensive experience that he has gained over the years.
I voted for this proposal because I believe that it will benefit the EU, since a properly functioning procurement market is of essential importance in order to foster the Single Market, to stimulate innovation, and to promote a higher level of protection of the environment and climate, as well as social inclusion, throughout the EU. Public procurement is of crucial relevance, serving as a catalyst for the revitalisation of the EU economy and, accordingly, for employment and welfare.
I voted for this proposal because it gives an extensive review of the current global issues in the EU and UN, pointing out the challenges and the opportunities that the EU is facing.
I voted for this report and in doing so welcome the audit strategy of the Court of Auditors for the period 2009-2012 and support its priority goals (maximising the overall impact from its audits and increasing efficiency by making best use of resources). I expect the Court of Auditors to report on the steps taken to implement this audit strategy as well as to demonstrate the progress in this direction using the Key Performance Indicators (KPI), in particular with the introduction of KPI 1 to 4 in 2010. I particularly welcome the plan to publish follow-ups in respect of the special reports to increase their impact.
I voted for this report and in doing so, urge the Commission to ensure that fishing activities that fall under the Fisheries Partnership Agreement meet the same sustainability criteria as fishing activities in EU waters.
I voted for this report and take the view that, in order to be consistent with the EU's own values, EU foreign policy and external action must give priority to promoting democracy and the rule of law, good governance and fair societies, given that a rule-based democratic society is the basis for upholding human rights as well as for enhancing stability.
I voted for this report and welcome the fact that bilateral investment treaties are now part of the common commercial policy.
I voted for this report as I feel that it offers viable solutions for improving research and innovation in the European Union and, by extension, provides the conditions for a return to economic growth and the creation of new jobs.
I voted for this report because I agree that the Council should be able, after debating a Commission recommendation, to impose a fine on any Member State that distorts, whether intentionally or through grave negligence, figures relating to the deficit and public debt relevant to the application of Articles 121 and 126 of the Treaty, and to the Protocol (No 12) annexed to the Treaty. I also agree that the aforementioned fines should act as an effective deterrent and should be proportional to the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence. I agree that it should not be possible for the fine to exceed 0.2% of gross domestic product.
I voted for this report because I believe impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument for the legislative process, and one which European legislators should make greater use of in future.
I voted for this report because I believe that it is only by using proper instruments that we can have a realistic view of the situation, and therefore do our best to change it if necessary.
I voted for this report because I believe that the cultural and creative industries should constitute an added value for the Union. A European statute for artists based on favourable working conditions and tax regimes would promote Europe as a dynamic and challenging environment in which to live and work, making it attractive to skilled and creative individuals.
I voted for this report because I believe the Court of Auditors may benefit from Mr Wessberg's experience in the financial management of institutions.
I voted for this report because I believe this is a good time for the Commission's Green Paper, officially endorsing the economic and social importance of the sector, to prompt discussion on 'unlocking the potential of the cultural and creative industries'. The growth of cultural and creative industries in the European Union since the 1990s has been exponential in terms of job creation and of their contribution to GDP.
I voted for this report because I think that indicators need to be found to complement GDP and help us measure factors such as climate change, biodiversity or resource efficiency.
I voted for this report because it is important that we develop a tool which can complement GDP, taking into account that it has to be done in a way so that it can have practical use, based on clearly defined indicators and high-quality data.
I voted for this report because it represents Parliament's contribution to the discussions on means of ensuring more effective governance in financial institutions in Europe.
I voted for this report because the Court of Auditors has stated that is has reasonable assurances that the 2009 accounts for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, and because on 5 May 2010 Parliament granted the Executive Director of the European Food Safety Authority discharge in respect of the implementation of the EFSA's 2008 budget.
I voted for this report because the committee responsible considers that, in giving the interview in question, Luigi de Magistris was acting in the performance of his duties as Member of the European Parliament and carrying out political activities by expressing his opinion on a matter of public interest to his constituents.
I voted for this report because the full application of the Schengen agreement in Bulgaria and Romania certainly means the abolition of border checks for these countries as well.
I voted for this report entitled 'GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world'. As the report rightly says, gross domestic product (GDP), which is used by political decision makers worldwide and referred to in public debates, has also come to take on the role of a comprehensive indicator for overall societal development and progress in general.
I voted for this report for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the operating space, access to the driving position and the doors and windows of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors (codified text).
I voted for this report giving discharge to the Committee of the Regions (CoR), and I am pleased that, in our resolution, Parliament 'reconfirms its position that, in the interests of transparency, declarations of financial interests of members of all Union institutions should be accessible on the Internet via a public register; reminds the CoR of its request that CoR members declare their financial interests, disclosing relevant information on declarable professional activities and remunerated posts or activities; notes with satisfaction the CoR response on the matter, in particular the letter of the president of the CoR of 11 February 2011; [and] requests the CoR to follow up this issue in its Annual Activity Report'.

I voted for this report which is driven by the European Union's policy commitment to simplify the legislation in force with a view to creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses, mainly with respect to the simplification of customs formalities carried out by importers of certain textile products released for free circulation in the EU.
I voted for this report, because with it the European Parliament consented to the approval of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation Agreement, which would promote responsible exploitation of fishery resources and marine eco-systems.
I voted for this report, the purpose of which is to extend the scope of the proposal for a regulation on the cross-border transportation of euro cash by road between euro area Member States (the main proposal) to the territory of Member States that are about to introduce the euro, since there is normally an increased need for euro cash transportation in the run-up to the changeover.
I voted for this report, the recommendation for second reading, because it restores the vast majority of Parliament's amendments at first reading, including those relating to origin marking, indication of animal-derived materials and multi-fibre textile products.
I voted for this report, which underlines the need for more rigorous examination of projects at the application stage in order to prevent shortcomings, and, accordingly, invites the Commission to further improve the use of guidance and checklists by providing clearer criteria for assessing grant applications in order to enhance the effectiveness and consistency of the procedures and their results, and to ensure proper follow-up action in cases of non-provision of required information or action.
I voted for this report. I did so because the Court of Auditors says it has sufficient assurances that the 2009 accounts of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, and because on 5 May 2010 Parliament granted the Executive Director of the ENISA discharge in respect of the implementation of its 2008 budget.
I voted for this report. I did so because the Court of Auditors says it has sufficient assurances that the 2009 accounts of the European Training Foundation (ETF) are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, and because on 5 May 2010 Parliament granted the Executive Director of the ETF discharge in respect of the implementation of its 2008 budget. I agree with the entire content of the report and I would highlight the ETF's initiative of providing the discharge authority with the Internal Audit Service (IAS) Annual Internal Audit Report, as it is a sign of transparency to be followed by all other agencies.
I voted for this resolution and I should like to emphasise that Russia's energy policy towards the EU Member States and the countries of Eastern Europe will be a litmus test of whether and how genuinely Russia will be able to go down the path of modernisation and democracy.
I voted for this resolution and would like to emphasise that Russia will always be a very important partner of the European Union.
I voted for this resolution because the statement identifies the main problems and priorities for the EU in the new Multiannual Financial Framework. I should particularly like to emphasise the call contained in the resolution for the Commission to present proposals for an effective and efficient EU common agricultural policy (CAP), which would more fairly distribute direct payments between Member States and farmers, and strengthen the link between delivery of public goods to society and support payments to farmers. I fully support the call for the funds allocated to the CAP in the budget year 2013 to be maintained at the same level for the next financial programming period also, so that the CAP can fulfil its expanded objectives and tasks.
I voted for this resolution on the Agency for Fundamental Rights and I support calls on the Agency to make progress in ensuring, as far as possible, a realistic evaluation of tenders.
I voted for this resolution which 'considers that the problem of undeclared work needs to be tackled; states that the domestic work sector is characterised by a high level of informality and undeclared work, that many migrant workers are employed in this sector, and that their rights are often violated; further, considers it essential to combat precarious work in general, given that this problem affects migrant workers in particular, thus worsening their already vulnerable position'.
I voted for this resolution which calls on both sides in Sudan, in the run-up to independence day on 9 July 2011, to present concrete plans on the setting-up and/or reform of their institutions in order for the two states to be viable as of that date.
I voted for this resolution which calls on the Council to award the title 'European Capital of Culture' exceptionally to Sarajevo in 2014. I believe that awarding the title to a city which was the site of such tragic events in the course of the 20th century would be an important step towards transcending past European divisions and showcasing the new Europe.
I voted for this resolution which reaffirms the urgent need for Russia to implement fundamental principles of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and media freedom as a basis for cooperation, and calls on Russia to take concrete action to improve its human rights record and to protect journalists, human rights activists, minorities and opposition representatives from violence and intimidation.
I voted for this resolution which urges the Commission to speed up its activities with regard to revising and improving the directive and other relevant legislation so as to put an end to the misleading practices of business directory companies as soon as possible, notably by specifically blacklisting misleading practices by business directories
I voted in favour because I advocate freedom of expression for Members when performing their duties, and in order to defend the interests of the European Parliament as an institution.

I voted in favour of Mr Audy's report because I consider investment in the research and innovation sector to be fundamental to competitiveness, growth and job creation in the EU. I consider the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme for research and development 2007-2013 to be particularly useful for the purpose of drawing useful conclusions based on an evaluation of the current situation. I welcome the rapporteur's proposal to simplify financing procedures and to adopt a performance-driven approach and the criteria of 'excellence' and 'European added value' in EU spending.
I voted in favour of Mr Coelho's report on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania.
I voted in favour of Mr Falbr's report because I consider that the promotion of corporate social responsibility in Europe needs to be increased, in a bid to respond directly to the need to defend common values and to increase solidarity and cohesion between Europeans.
I voted in favour of Mr Itälä's report, but I have reservations about recital 113. I totally disagree with this recital, which proposes a new system for interpretation services for 'working groups'. I cannot agree with it, because the proposed system: does not square with the principle of equal treatment of the Union's official languages and of their users; will eventually undoubtedly lead to the exclusion of languages other than the six mentioned; will, in practice, be impossible to run in a workable fashion, for the simple reason that the member concerned will have to submit a request for interpretation in a supplementary language before they get to see the agenda; risks turning the language policy into a power game.
I voted in favour of Mr Karim's reports.
I voted in favour of Mr Mitchell's report because it defines essential and correct directions for the future adoption and operation of the financing instrument for development cooperation by learning useful lessons from the use currently being made of this development cooperation tool. EU funds for development cooperation are a real mechanism for combating poverty and promoting democratisation and development in developing countries.
I voted in favour of Mr Moreira's report on customs security measures because I feel it is important that well-defined trade rules be established for a country which, while not part of the EU, is an enclave within it, and thus perfectly placed for commercial integration.
I voted in favour of Mrs Ferreira's report because I believe that an EU-coordinated surveillance mechanism for the identification and prevention of macroeconomic imbalances is important, as is a procedure for the correction of excessive imbalances.
I voted in favour of Mrs McCarthy's report, which requests the Commission to propose a European Order for the Preservation of Assets and a European Order for the Disclosure of Assets.

I voted in favour of Mrs Ţicău's report as Canada should be seen as a priority partner for agreements of this kind, given that both Europe and Canada have world-leading aircraft manufacturers.
I voted in favour of Mrs Ţicău's report because the project under examination meets many expectations of those looking to developments in research and technology with optimism. EGNOS and Galileo are projects that will generate approximately EUR 60 billion of indirect benefits to the European Union economy and society, in the form of enhanced road and aviation security, reduced air pollution and pesticide consumption, new jobs and public safety, generating very significant value for money.
I voted in favour of Mrs Ţicău's report, which gives the European Parliament's green light for applying an Agreement between the European Community and Canada on civil aviation safety.
I voted in favour of Parliament's resolution on credit rating agencies (CRAs) because I agree that it is essential to reduce the unfair competition caused by the CRAs' common practice of assessing market participants while simultaneously obtaining orders from them. I believe the Commission should carefully assess the potential use of alternative instruments to measure credit risk.
I voted in favour of adopting the annual report on the main aspects of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) in 2009.
I voted in favour of adopting the final compromise as it marks an important step forward for consumer protection, offering additional legal certainty for both consumers and traders. I think that the directive offers numerous merits, one of which is maximum harmonisation for distance selling and off-premises contracts, with a few exceptions.
I voted in favour of authorising discharge of the 2009 budget of the Court of Justice because I believe its formal and substantial accuracy is the result of extremely competent work done by all the staff of this institution.

I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to Eurojust since, as the report shows, it has managed its resources extremely well and, by using many indicators to explain its financial situation, has also done so extremely transparently. I do however regret the continued requests that the Court of Auditors has had to make regarding public procurement and recruitment procedures, which have still not received an adequate response or solution.
I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the Artemis Joint Undertaking because it has managed its finances extremely well for an agency which is still in the start-up period. I therefore think that improvements can be made in the future and that the inconsistencies reported in the accounts for this financial year can be corrected.
I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex) because, as the report states, its accounts and transactions, taken as a whole, are shown in the analysis to be positive, regular and legal.
I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control because the rapporteur has succeeded in identifying the most significant problems in terms of the transparency and accuracy of the accounts and because I am confident that this important and useful Agency will work on its administration in order to improve the areas pointed out, without undoing the good work that it has already done.
I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the European Commission because, despite the difficulties in managing these funds, the result obtained by the Court of Auditors shows objective improvements.

I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the Joint Undertaking for the Implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines because, as the report shows, the Court of Auditors has deemed the Undertaking's accounts and the underlying transactions to be reliable. I think, however, that even though it is to some extent justifiable as it is still in the start-up phase, the Undertaking should complete the implementation of its control systems and operate more carefully and transparently in the coming years.
I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the SESAR Joint Undertaking because that recently formed undertaking has convinced the Court of Auditors of its reliability.
I voted in favour of granting Pakistan emergency trade preferences for textile and other products in the EU in order for these trade preferences not simply to be a purely token measure that filled the pockets of the corrupt elites in Pakistan. I call for effective control over the increased income by democratic trade unions to ensure that the money is directed towards rebuilding schools and hospitals in the areas affected by flooding.
I voted in favour of granting Parliament discharge in respect of its 2009 budget because I take the view that, overall, the resources have been managed wisely. I remain highly sceptical about the division between the three places of work: it creates waste and stress and, symbolism aside, I think there is a fairly urgent need to take steps to get rid of this tripartite system, which has an economic and environmental cost.
I voted in favour of granting additional aid to Georgia.
I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 budget of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking because, despite a number of irregularities in the Undertaking's budget, I think that we can be confident of future improvements in its auditing performance since it is still in the start-up phase.
I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 budget of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work because I think that, despite some inconsistencies identified by the Court of Auditors in the management of some funds and irregularities with respect to a procurement procedure, it can be said that the management on the whole has been good.

I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Chemicals Agency since the report shows that, despite several gaps and imperfections in the accounts, partly due to the recent creation of this Agency, its performance in terms of controls and budget management has steadily improved.
I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Food Safety Authority, not only because the Court of Auditors has declared that the accounts are reliable and that the underlying transactions are regular and legal, but also because the Agency has allocated some funds from its reserve for the completion of a number of important projects in infrastructure, information technology development and scientific cooperation, for example.
I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Maritime Safety Authority because, despite the previous absence of a multiannual programme and significant concern over the high number of budget transfers in 2008, the Agency has shown improvements in its management and, taken as a whole, the Court of Auditors had a positive view of the annual accounts and the underlying transactions.
I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction as it has managed its resources prudently and in line with expectations.
I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Railway Agency since, as the report shows, it managed its resources well overall.

I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2009, Section V - Court of Auditors.
I voted in favour of granting the European Economic and Social Committee discharge in respect of its 2009 budget because, despite the issues raised by the recent European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) investigation, I am confident that it is possible to clarify the aspects that were not transparent and to improve reporting procedures for the future.
I voted in favour of it, and I hope this Parliament will continue to make a contribution towards the goal of enhancing EU strategic autonomy in security affairs.

I voted in favour of the Dess report entitled 'The CAP towards 2020: meeting the food, natural resources and territorial challenges of the future'.

To achieve this, a budget commensurate with the ambitious objectives to be pursued is required.
I voted in favour of the Deß report on the common agricultural policy, which evaluates the communication from the European Commission on the CAP towards 2020.

I voted in favour of the Gualtieri report.
I voted in favour of the Mitchell report because we need to learn the lessons of the last four years of using Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI).

I voted in favour of the Schwab report, which strengthens the rights of consumers and safeguards them in particular when they are the weak contractual party, for example when they make purchases away from business premises.
I voted in favour of the Stavrakakis report because I believe that the various European funds available for implementing regional policies should be made easier to use. I refer in particular to the development of synergies for an integrated approach between the different sectoral policies that exist in the field of regional policy, as highlighted in the report.

I voted in favour of the candidature of Mr. Mario Draghi as next President of the European Central Bank for his great competence and his progressive view on the governance of the global financial system.

I voted in favour of the draft Council Regulation concerning the extension of the scope of the regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash between euro area Member States. I voted in favour of it because I consider that extending the scope of the regulation is necessary and will resolve problems relating to the safety of the personnel responsible for transportation.
I voted in favour of the identification of new parameters more representative of a country's progress, and not just its consumption, although I think more should be done.

I voted in favour of the report '2009 discharge: performance, financial management and control of EU agencies' in order to acknowledge that the functioning of all EU agencies needs to be further improved.
I voted in favour of the report because I agree that, when the Commission carries out its economic reading of the scoreboard in connection with the alert mechanism, it should pay particular attention to the evolution of the real economy, including economic growth and employment and unemployment rates; nominal and real convergence inside and outside the euro area; the development of productivity and its main drivers, such as research and development and external or internal investment; and trends at sectoral level, including energy, which affect the performance of both gross domestic product and current account balance.
I voted in favour of the report because it is essential to be able to offer consumers a certain level of protection even when they make purchases outside their own country.
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Coelho proposing the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the 'Schengen area'. This is one of the greatest achievements of the European integration process.

I voted in favour of the report by Mr Manders.

I voted in favour of the report on EU environmental economic accounts as I believe that there need to be indicators for sustainable development and public welfare, beyond gross domestic product (GDP), that enable the evaluation of European environmental policy.

I voted in favour of the report on the amendment to Parliament's Rules of Procedure following the establishment of a common transparency register because the principle of transparency should govern all those involved in decision making and in implementing EU policy.

I voted in favour of the report on the proposal for a regulation of Parliament and of the Council repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 on proof of origin for certain textile products falling within Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature and released for free circulation in the Community, and on the conditions for the acceptance of such proof and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries. I voted in favour with reservations, but did so because, overall, it is positive and is in line with EU policy commitment to simplify the legislation in force, with a view to creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses, mainly with respect to the simplification of customs formalities observed by importers of certain textile products released for free circulation in the Union, and with the objective of making the rules for importing more uniform, by aligning the rules relating to textile imports with those for other industrial goods, which should improve the overall consistency of the legislative environment in this area.

Further simplification and adaptation to new challenges, such as climate change, as well as determining the external dimension of the EU's internal policies, are important aspects that must be taken into consideration. I agree with the provision set out in the resolution that the future instrument for supplying EU development aid must be adequately equipped in financial terms.

I voted in favour of this document, because under Article 179(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Union shall 'encourage undertakings, including small and medium-sized undertakings, research centres and universities in their research and technological development activities of high quality; it shall support their efforts to cooperate with one another, aiming, notably, at permitting researchers to cooperate freely across borders and at enabling undertakings to exploit the internal market potential to the full, in particular, through the opening up of national public contracts, the definition of common standards and the removal of legal and fiscal obstacles to that cooperation'. I am utterly convinced that the EU must take an offensive stance and take a firm front runner position in competitiveness, and must therefore invest in an innovation blast.
I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 70/157/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles.
I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 76/432/EEC of 6 April 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the braking devices of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors.
I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 80/181/EEC of 20 December 1979 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement and the repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC.
I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 80/720/EEC of 24 June 1980 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the operating space, access to the driving position and the doors and windows of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors.
I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 86/415/EEC of 24 July 1986 on the installation, location, operation and identification of the controls of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors.
I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 87/402/EEC of 25 June 1987 on roll-over protection structures mounted in front of the driver's seat on narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors.
I voted in favour of this document, codifying Council Directive 92/79/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on cigarettes, Council Directive 92/80/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes and Council Directive 95/59/EC of 27 November 1995 on taxes other than turnover taxes which affect the consumption of manufactured tobacco.
I voted in favour of this document, repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1541/98 on proof of origin for certain textile products falling within Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature and released for free circulation in the Community, and on the conditions for the acceptance of such proof and amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries.
I voted in favour of this document.
I voted in favour of this important document.
I voted in favour of this important resolution on Investing in the future: a new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe. I support the rapporteur that with the rejection of the option of freezing the resources, as proposed by five Heads of Government in December 2010 (France, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany and Finland), the European Parliament is sending a strong political signal for the negotiations between the 27 Member States, due to start after the official presentation of the European Commission proposal expected on 29 June.
I voted in favour of this important resolution on the application of the Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania. I agree with the rapporteur's position that, although there are some outstanding issues that will require regular reporting and a follow-up at some point in the future, they do not constitute an obstacle to full Schengen membership for these two Member States.
I voted in favour of this important resolution on the state of play of the EU-India free trade agreement negotiations.
I voted in favour of this joint position on the Eurovignette Directive presented at second reading by the Council and Parliament.
I voted in favour of this motion for a resolution on the EU-Mauritania Fisheries Partnership Agreement because I consider the renewal of the agreement, which should include a human rights clause, positive. I think it is necessary to continue helping the country further to develop a responsible fisheries policy which meets requirements regarding conservation of fisheries resources.
I voted in favour of this own-initiative report because the increasingly important contribution of the aviation sector brings with it many advantages for the European economy, but also quite a few disadvantages. I believe that the institution to which I belong, namely Parliament, should be given greater supervisory powers so that it has a full understanding of the types of agreement that do or do not deserve its consent.
I voted in favour of this parliamentary recommendation to the Council so that the Council may proceed, on behalf of the EU, to adopt the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing.
I voted in favour of this particular report on macroeconomic imbalances because it addresses the details about the current debt issue in some member states, and more importantly, it offers a progressive method to solve such a serious problem concerning not only short-term but also long-term consequences. I believe that Europe needs progressive investment to help with economic growth and job creation, and therefore simply just cutting budgets could only undermine the entire economic and political system in the long term.
I voted in favour of this proposal for a regulation because it creates new uses for national accounts data, environmental statistics and other statistical domains.
I voted in favour of this recommendation as I believe that the scope of this regulation should be able to be extended to the territory of any Member State about to join the euro.
I voted in favour of this recommendation because I approve of the conclusion of an agreement which, on the one hand, will benefit European and Canadian companies and airlines by saving millions of euro, thanks to shorter and simpler certification procedures, and, on the other hand, will ensure a higher level of security for passengers.
I voted in favour of this recommendation because I believe the scope of the regulation on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between Member States should be extended to the territory of countries that are about to introduce the single currency.
I voted in favour of this recommendation because I feel it corresponds to the best interests of both parties.
I voted in favour of this report and endorsed discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work for the financial year 2009.
I voted in favour of this report as I believe that businesses have a social responsibility - towards their employees and customers, the environment and society at large. A new term has been added to the German dictionary: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). This is - and should remain - a voluntary matter.
I voted in favour of this report as I believe that the application of the proposed Action Plan on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) will contribute to the establishment of a transport network that is more efficient through safer, more environmentally friendly and more economical modes of transport.
I voted in favour of this report as I understand that the analysis therein is extremely relevant to the development of a common security and defence policy (CSDP). The tabled document maximises the EU's role, strengthening the synergies between Member States, and between them and the EU institutions.
I voted in favour of this report as it introduces a range of measures to successfully address a number of societal challenges, specifically climate change, energy and resource scarcity, population ageing, and problems accessing public services and quality healthcare.
I voted in favour of this report as it is important to clarify matters at a time when the role of lobbies is still giving rise to much debate and, at times, conjecture among European citizens.
I voted in favour of this report as it significantly improves cooperation between committees, as part of the necessary parliamentary reform.
I voted in favour of this report as it was an improvement on the original Commission text. I particularly welcome the provisions for upholding workers' rights and the importance of a comprehensive assessment of economic performance, particularly including employment.
I voted in favour of this report as the Council's annual report provides a clear view of the policies and actions of the EU's common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and contributes to strengthening interinstitutional dialogue.
I voted in favour of this report because I agree that Croatia's participation in the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is vital for combating illicit drug use and trafficking, both within Croatia itself, and throughout the EU. As a coastal state on the EU's external borders, Croatia is used as a transit country in international drugs trafficking, and it is therefore especially important for the EU to provide this country's national institutions with all the assistance necessary for combating a phenomenon that poses a particular threat to health and social stability.
I voted in favour of this report because I agree that demographic changes and increasing longevity mean that working lives will be more varied, and retraining and participation in lifelong learning have already become a necessity.
I voted in favour of this report because I agree that it is very important to continuously improve the quality of EU law making, and this report sets out concrete proposals for improving the law making process both within the European Parliament and the Commission.
I voted in favour of this report because I agree with its underlying spirit: to simplify and harmonise EU legislation on imports of textile products in order to facilitate trade with third countries. I believe, in fact, that the limited trade policy measures applied by the EU in the textiles sector can be managed entirely without imposing the excessive burden of presenting proof of origin for all imports.
I voted in favour of this report because I believe it takes due account of the role played by the agricultural sector from an economic and employment point of view, and in the field of sustainable development and biodiversity preservation.
I voted in favour of this report because I believe that an appropriate mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities is particularly important for establishing whether the programme's implementation accords with the objectives set.
I voted in favour of this report because I believe that an excellent job has been done, despite the complexity of the issue.
I voted in favour of this report because I believe that, within the European Union, individual Member States still deliver early education very differently from one another.
I voted in favour of this report because I consider it essential that the Commission pursues its efforts to ensure a better definition of the creative cultural industries (CCIs) as part of their greater recognition by civil society. I foresee great potential for the CCIs, especially if we consider the possible and necessary cooperation with universities, research centres and art schools, with which we can set up a network of joint training programmes and lifelong learning.
I voted in favour of this report because I entirely agree that following the natural catastrophe that recently struck Japan, and which was the greatest in the country's history, the EU can and must help this country's economy to recover quickly.
I voted in favour of this report because I share the rapporteur's views concerning the focal points of the common agricultural policy reform for the period after April 2013.
I voted in favour of this report because it clearly points out that the EU agricultural budget in the next financing period has to be maintained at least at the same level as the 2013 considering that only with adequate financial resources will be possible to meet the challenges of food security and environmental protection.
I voted in favour of this report because it highlights how important it is for young people to have a multidisciplinary education, as far as the targets of the EU 2020 strategy are concerned.
I voted in favour of this report because it is necessary to amend Parliament's Rules of Procedure following the establishment by the European Parliament and the Commission of a common transparency register. I would like to underline that following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Parliament's powers have been strengthened and it is now colegislator in almost all areas under the ordinary legislative procedure.
I voted in favour of this report because it sets out the situation relating to credit rating agencies (CRAs) clearly and objectively. I, too, believe that CRAs play a necessary and extremely useful role in distilling and simplifying the torrent of information about the financial markets, both in terms of the solvency and reliability of debt issuers as well as in terms of individual financial instruments.
I voted in favour of this report because it stresses the importance of agreeing on a systemic approach to setting up a coherent 'Beyond GDP system' to contribute to improved policy analysis. GDP is an indicator of economic activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world.
I voted in favour of this report because its aim is to create maximum opportunities for business and individual consumers to take advantage of wireless Internet, radio and television services, freeing up radio spectrum.
I voted in favour of this report because its primary aim is to repeal the EU regulation currently in force, laying down additional requirements proving the origin of textile products imported into the EU, thus simplifying the legislation in force and creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses.
I voted in favour of this report because the Council's annual report provides a consistent overview of the direction and actions of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP). It is very important for the Council to continue to focus, above all, on regional conflicts and react to them swiftly.
I voted in favour of this report because the European Union must continue to enhance its security strategy, uphold its values, pursue its interests, and protect its citizens, thereby contributing to the preservation of international peace and global security.
I voted in favour of this report because there are still cases where the conventions and agreements of the International Labour Organisation are not properly implemented or only partially implemented and the principles of corporate social responsibility are violated.
I voted in favour of this report because there has been a sharp increase in political and humanitarian crises in the world, which calls for improved and more preventive EU multilateral action.
I voted in favour of this report because, as it clearly points out, young people are the real resource of the future.
I voted in favour of this report for two main reasons.
I voted in favour of this report on the annual report from the Council to Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) in 2009, as I agree with the majority of the observations made by Parliament. I would stress the fact that the report does not propose possible approaches for resolving the conflicts and issues that it presents in such a transparent way.
I voted in favour of this report on the development of the common security and defence policy (CSDP) following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.
I voted in favour of this report on the future of the common agricultural policy (CAP). As a result of the negotiations and the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, this document, though still too vague, has evolved significantly and is now trying to bring about real reform of the CAP.
I voted in favour of this report on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste to send a clear message to the Member States: polluters must be held responsible for their waste.
I voted in favour of this report on the proposal for a Council decision on the conclusion of an agreement between the European Community and Canada on civil aviation safety.
I voted in favour of this report on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on Consumer Rights.
I voted in favour of this report proposing that the register of interest groups should cover all the different European institutions.
I voted in favour of this report since I consider it absolutely essential to strengthen European policies on the conservation and sustainable management of forests, whose incalculable economic, social and environmental value it is important to preserve.
I voted in favour of this report to enable the transformation of a report which is all too often about exploitation and the law, in an area which represents between 5 and 9% of all jobs within the European Union.
I voted in favour of this report, but I think we should have been clearer and stronger in our demands when it comes to the mechanism of sanctions and penalties.
I voted in favour of this report, which aims to acknowledge and enhance the economic and social importance of the cultural and creative industries (CCIs). Focusing EU attention on these industries and organising their potential through a coherent strategy, including funding, meets at least two of the priorities that Lega Nord has always upheld.
I voted in favour of this report, which recommends public policies in favour of childcare that are a step in the right direction.
I voted in favour of this report, which represents an important contribution to the European added value of cross-financing between the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF) in terms of increased flexibility for social inclusion projects and integrated urban development programmes.
I voted in favour of this report, which will enable the exponential demand for access to high frequency-consuming mobile Internet to be met in the short term, in particular, through the allocation of the entire 800 MHz band, freed up by the changeover to digital television in our various countries, to electronic communications services.
I voted in favour of this report. A sound assessment of European environmental policy is only possible if reliable data is available.
I voted in favour of this report. I was keen in particular that we should ensure effective monitoring of the trends of imports of products covered by this Regulation as far in advance as possible and establish customs surveillance on these imports. I am also in favour of the idea that a quarterly report should be submitted on the application and implementation of the monitoring.
I voted in favour of this resolution because I feel that the European Parliament's contribution to the debate on how money from the EU budget should be distributed in future (2014-2020), and which areas should be financed to help Europe recover following the global crisis, is particularly important.
I voted in favour of this resolution because cooperation at European Union level in the field of vocational training is a very important factor for achieving the Europe 2020 goals and reducing the level of youth unemployment. I agree with the proposal that, in forming a vocational education and training system, every Member State should devote particular attention to low-skilled workers, migrants, people with disabilities and other socially vulnerable groups.
I voted in favour of this resolution because ensuring that young citizens can travel and work throughout the EU is essential in order to boost competitiveness. EU 2020 objectives can be achieved by investing in programmes that provide young people with a wide variety of opportunities and promote labour market mobility.
I voted in favour of this resolution because it calls for the use of the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) to take account of the different consequences in each Member State of the economic crisis for the final years of the programme (2011-2013), given the considerable sums (EUR 28.8 billion over three years) still to be programmed, the objectives to be achieved for EU 2020 and preparation for a European Research Area and the Innovation Union.
I voted in favour of this resolution because it emphasises the pivotal role that the European Union wants and should play with respect to third countries, especially with the EU's trading partners.
I voted in favour of this resolution on EU policy in the short and medium term on transport applications of Global Navigation Satellite Systems, above all because, across the entire EU, significant attention should be paid to the GNSS and Galileo projects in the transport sector.
I voted in favour of this resolution on European cooperation in vocational education and training to support the Europe 2020 strategy.
I voted in favour of this resolution on GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world. GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world.
I voted in favour of this resolution on a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing the first radio spectrum policy programme. I agree with the rapporteur's opinion that the need for one single internal market is crucial for Europe to take a leadership in the global economy, with a focus on the service sector and the knowledge economy.
I voted in favour of this resolution on guaranteeing independent impact assessments. I agree with the rapporteur that impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument in the legislative process, and one which European legislators should make greater use of in future. IAs show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options and help them make a decision. IAs can thus make a significant contribution to better law making.
I voted in favour of this resolution on the Commission Green Paper on forest protection and information in the EU: preparing forests for climate change.
I voted in favour of this resolution on the external dimension of social policy, promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility.
I voted in favour of this resolution on the grounds that the Council's 2009 annual report on the common foreign and security policy (CFSP) - whose transparency I commend - stresses the importance of the European Union continuing to develop its foreign policy objectives, and to promote its values and interests at international level, with the general aim of contributing to peace, to security, to solidarity, to conflict prevention, to the promotion of democracy, to the protection of human rights, to gender equality, to respect for international law, to support for international institutions, to effective multilateralism, to mutual respect between nations, to sustainable development, to free and fair trade, and to the eradication of poverty.
I voted in favour of this resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council providing further macro-financial assistance to Georgia.
I voted in favour of this resolution, because a well-functioning procurement market is particularly important for fostering the Single Market and stimulating innovation.
I voted in favour of this resolution, not only because of the importance of the upcoming 66th session of the UN General Assembly, but also because it is vitally important that the EU finally steps up cooperation and coordination in this and all other UN bodies.
I voted in favour of this resolution, which has the merit of simplifying the existing system concerning the labelling of textile products, as well as encouraging the development and uptake of new fibres and shortening the time between the submission of an application and the adoption of a new fibre name.
I voted in favour of this resolution. A well-functioning procurement market is particularly important for fostering the integrity of the Single Market and stimulating innovation, and for achieving optimal value for public authorities and tax payers.
I voted in favour, particularly in consideration of the amendment in which we see that: 'Without prejudice to the conditions set out in paragraph 1, entitlement to benefit from the preferential arrangements introduced by Article 1 is subject to respect for human rights, including core labour rights, and the fundamental principles of democracy by Pakistan.' Respect for human rights must be a necessary precondition for any kind of agreement with third countries.
I voted in favour. I must point out, however, that we need to identify better ways to use the revenues, making it mandatory for the Member States to invest these resources to improve the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) and infrastructure for reducing pollution.
I voted on Wednesday, 8 June for an increase in the 2014-2020 budget.
I voted on this report because it presents the European Parliament's reaction to the Green Paper published by the Commission, intended to begin public consultation on forest protection and preparing forests for climate change throughout the European Union.
I voted to give discharge to Eurojust and congratulate the agency for establishing measures to estimate the market value of relevant products/services before commencing a procurement procedure. I consider this initiative an important practice to be followed by other agencies. I welcome, in addition, the agency's annual procurement plan for 2009 which greatly helped Eurojust's units and services in the management of their tenders. I consider that these initiatives improve the authorising officer's guidance and control.
I voted to give discharge to European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working conditions but call on the Foundation to make sure that appropriations are made available only when the corresponding assigned revenue has been received; notes, in fact, that the Court of Auditors reported that, contrary to its Financial Regulation (Article 19), the Foundation's budget did not provide for specific headings for various programmes financed from assigned revenue; notes, moreover, that under a programme financed by assigned revenue, the Foundation committed EUR 184 000, although the assigned revenue actually received was only EUR 29 000. I regret that the Court of Auditors was compelled to comment on the budgetary and financial statement of the Foundation, especially to the effect that the initial provisional accounts presented by the Foundation contained serious shortcomings, pointing to significant weaknesses in the financial organisation of the Foundation; welcomes the Foundation's confirmation that it will ensure, through additional training and resources, that its implementation of year-end procedures and its adherence to the deadlines for the presentation of its accounts is correct
I voted to give discharge to Frontex, but observe that the Court of Auditors reported, for the second year running, that the agency paid out amounts on the basis of unilateral grant decisions signed by the agency, while the rules in force make no provision for this type of instrument. I note that the amount paid out was more than EUR 28 000 000 in 2009, and was EUR 17 000 000 in 2008. I welcome, nevertheless, the agency's initiative, made in response to the Court's observation, of signing a framework Partnership Agreement with Member State border authorities.
I voted to give discharge to the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work. I welcome the Agency's initiative of providing the discharge authority with the Internal Audit Service (IAS)'s Annual Internal Audit Report. I congratulate the Agency on its considerable progress in this respect.
I voted to give discharge to the European Aviation Safety Agency but urge the Agency to implement an activity-based structure for the operational budget in order to establish a clear link between the work programme and the financial forecasts and improve performance monitoring and reporting; note that the Agency prepares a multiannual plan every year, discussed with all stakeholders and approved by the Management Board, in which the budget per activity is presented; and acknowledge the view of the Court of Auditors that the structure of the Agency's operational budget (Title III) remained partially input-related and that the budget amendments were made without updating the work programme, even when they had a significant impact on the allocation of human and financial resources
I voted to give discharge to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and take the view that the Centre's powers must be strengthened so that the Union has an independent capacity to assess the severity of the risk of infection should a pandemic occur, and so that coordination between the Member States can be improved.
I voted to give discharge to the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training. I congratulate the Centre for introducing a performance measurement system (PMS) in 2009 in respect of its 2009-2011 medium term priorities and its annual work programme, and for having set up a framework of performance indicators to monitor progress and measure output, outcome and impact; I consider, in particular, that the introduction of a PMS helps the Centre manage and evaluate its impact, efficiency, effectiveness and relevance; I believe, furthermore, that this system could include further improvements to the activity-based budget and closer monitoring of payment appropriations to avoid carryovers.
I voted to give discharge to the European Chemicals Agency but call on the Agency to inform the discharge authority of the steps taken to improve its control system by strengthening its financial circuits, workflows, audits, action plans and risk assessments.
I voted to give discharge to the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) but I note the Court of Auditors findings that the EDPS had not put in place a system of ex-post verification, where appropriate, as required by the Financial Regulation, and that the standards of internal control adopted by the EDPS did not provide for exceptions to standard financial procedures to be duly recorded in a central register.
I voted to give discharge to the European Development Funds. I welcome the fact that Parliament, in its report, reiterates its support for EDF budgetisation, which will strengthen the democratic control, accountability and transparency of funding and will provide more coherence in Union policy in relation to the ACP countries.
I voted to give discharge to the European Food Safety Authority, but regret that, for the third successive year, the Court of Auditors pointed out that commitments for operational activities carried over from the previous year had to be cancelled (19 % of commitments for operational activities carried over from 2008, 37 % of commitments for operational activities carried over from 2007 and 26 % of commitments for operational activities carried over from 2006). Parliament urges the Authority to change this situation and to notify the Court of Auditors of the measures taken.
I voted to give discharge to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addicition and, in doing so, welcome the fact that the Centre has further enhanced the annual forecast of its cash needs; notes that this forecast is constantly updated and submitted as a supporting document to the relevant Commission services to justify the Centre's quarterly request for payment of the next instalment of its annual subsidy allocated by the Union.
I voted to give discharge to the European Network and Information Security Agency and, in doing so, I note with disappointment that there has been no progress since the previous year concerning the refund of EUR 45 000 which is the amount of VAT paid in advance by the Agency to the tax authorities of the host Member State; urges, therefore, the Agency to inform the discharge authority when this refund is made by the host Member State.
I voted to give discharge to the European Railway Agency for its 2009 budget.
I voted to give discharge to the Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy. I am of the opinion that, in view of the size of its budget and the complexity of its tasks, the Joint Undertaking should establish an audit committee, reporting directly to the Governing Board.
I voted to give discharge to the Ombudsman and note, with satisfaction, that in 2009 the Ombudsman was able to help with almost 77% of all complaints and dealt with 70% of inquiries in less than one year, and I welcome the fact that the average length of inquiry was reduced to 9 months (from 13 months in 2008).
I voted to give the European Training Foundation discharge for its 2009 budget and welcome the Foundation's initiative of providing the discharge authority with the IAS Annual Internal Audit Report concerning the Foundation.
I voted to grant discharge to the Artemis Joint Undertaking but I believe that, in view of the size of its budget and the complexity of its tasks, the Joint Undertaking should consider establishing an audit committee reporting directly to the governing board.
I voted to grant discharge to the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking. I recognise that the Joint Undertaking is still in a start-up period. I am concerned, nevertheless, that the research activities pre-financed by the Commission in 2008 on behalf of the Joint Undertaking were not fully implemented during 2009 and that, as a result of delays in the projects, only EUR 8 700 000 or 65 % of the EUR 13 600 000 pre-financing was used. I am particularly concerned that the adoption, structure and presentation of the approved budget of the Joint Undertaking for 2009 were not in line with Regulation (EC) No 71/2008 setting up the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking, or with the Financial Rules of the Joint Undertaking. I therefore urge the Joint Undertaking to rapidly remedy this grave deficiency.
I voted to grant discharge to the Court of Justice, while noting the mixed results in terms of speeding up procedures. I welcome the increase in the number of cases completed by the Court of Justice (377 judgments and 165 orders compared to 333 and 161 respectively in 2008), take note of the number of preliminary ruling cases being the highest ever (302) and welcome the decrease in the number of cases pending at the end of 2009 (741 cases compared to 768 cases at the end of 2008). However, I note with concern that the General Court in 2009 showed a decrease in the number of cases decided and an increase in the duration of the proceedings and that consequently, although the number of new cases in 2009 was lower (568 new cases compared to 629 in 2008), the backlog of pending cases continued to increase (from 1178 in 2008 to 1191 in 2009). I also welcome the fact that the Civil Service Tribunal closed more cases than ever before (155 cases), and that the average duration of a procedure was 15.1 months compared to 17 months in 2008.
I voted to grant discharge to the European Maritime Safety Agency for its 2009 budget but call on the Agency to further reduce the number of posteriori commitments (i.e. legal commitments that were entered into before the corresponding budgetary commitments were made); reminds the Agency that, since 2006, the Court of Auditors has reported infringements of Article 62(1) of the Financial Regulation; welcomes, nevertheless, the Agency's efforts to improve this situation by providing ad hoc training to avoid posteriori commitments.
I voted to oppose the measures in this report relating to the Mercosur Trade deal.
I voted to reject Amendment 20, second part; Amendment 69, second part, as this had been recommended by both S&D voices on the Culture Committee, on which I sit as a substitute member.
I voted today in favour of the opinion of the European Parliament on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in the Republic of Bulgaria and Romania.
I voted, together with my colleagues from the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, against the resolution that deals with the negotiations for a free trade agreement between the European Union and India because it does not take sufficient account of the social standards with which all trade agreements must comply.
I want to acknowledge the constructiveness of the proposals and the debate, which I feel has been sufficiently vibrant and has fully expressed the mosaic of viewpoints which unite the European Parliament. I think that we come out of this debate, in any case, in a much richer position as a House and with a much improved political profile.
I want to ask President Barroso something directly: yesterday, the spokesman for the European Commission said at the press conference that there was no need for more reverse QMV in the governance package. I would ask you, Mr Barroso, to rectify this. I would ask that the Commission, together with the European Parliament, employ a more Communitarian method for the economic governance package.
I want to assure you that the Commission will continue its efforts to help people affected by this conflict.
I want to congratulate you, the Parliament, those that have been working most on this matter, and also the Hungarian Presidency of the Council, as it has done some very important work as well.
I want to draw attention to the proposal in this report for a financial transaction tax (FTT). A financial transaction tax could deal with two problems at once - how to finance ever-growing demands to put new EU policies in place, and how to make the financial sector contribute to the resolution of the economic crisis that it helped to cause.
I want to inform the Commission and the Council that this is the start of Parliament's campaign to win new rights for our citizens who are the victims of fraud.
I want to look not only southwards but also eastwards, because, on the one hand, I headed a parliamentary delegation to Turkmenistan and, on the other, yesterday I was appointed as Parliament's rapporteur for Russia.
I want to pay particular tribute to the fire services who were out working without sleep for three days or so, and to members of the defence forces - those who were working on the ground or in helicopters.
I want to raise one issue concerning Article 17 in the proposed Convention, which is about the role of agencies. I think this is something that we really should be looking at at European level because, increasingly, it is being seen as a weak link in many of the issues that we are facing.
I want to say firmly and emphatically: there are no substantive reasons, today, to delay Bulgaria and Romania's joining the Schengen area.
I want to state, however, that, contrary to popular opinion, this is not exclusively a problem brought about by intensive agriculture.
I want to welcome the adoption of this report and to underline the importance of Objective 3, which concerns territorial cooperation, in the European Union's cohesion policy.
I wanted another principals meeting in April, and we have prepared a substantial statement based on our position. I continue to believe a negotiated solution is the way forward, and we will stay engaged and have another envoys meeting later this month.
I wanted to express my support for this report on tractors placed on the market under the flexibility scheme because it introduces appropriate measures that take many aspects into account.
I warmly welcome Parliament's resolution on Sudan and South Sudan, which reiterates full respect for the referendum of January 2011, sanctioning the independence of South Sudan.
I was also astounded - I must make that clear - at how quickly Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission, took up the debate rather than taking a corrective European approach.
I was also reminded of the words of the great Irish poet, William Butler Yeats, who said 'peace comes dropping slow'. That was certainly the case in Northern Ireland, where the European Union played a crucial part through its support for the International Fund for Ireland, and that peace was copper-fastened last weekend with successful elections.
I was in Tunisia recently, where I met not only with the government and the President of the Republic, but also with representatives of civil society, women's organisations and trade unions. I saw how important they see our commitment to be, not only in the shape of support from governments, but also that of civil society.
I was keen to vote in favour of this resolution, which calls on the Commission to take strong measures in support of the fishing industry.
I was particularly pleased that we supported Amendment 27, which sensibly rejected the introduction of burdensome and unclear requirements derived from the Water Framework Directive into the cost-compliant system until we have a much clearer picture with regard to its implementation in the various Member States.
I was privileged to be present in East Timor at the birth of the world's first new state of this millennium. I hope that South Sudan can achieve its independence while averting the tragic transition suffered by the people of East Timor and providing peace and prosperity for the Sudanese people, who have suffered too much during the longest running civil war in Africa.
I was rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on this report. I have endeavoured to emphasise the link that exists between forests and rural communities, based on the economic and social role which forests play as an important source of income and also in agricultural production. I feel that the role of forests in the future common agricultural policy is an important aspect of this.
I was responsible for the discharge of the agencies, where the Committee on Budgetary Control has executed its task of exercising control over the administration of a significant number of decentralised agencies and joint undertakings.
I was responsible for the opinion on the radio spectrum policy programme in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and I am very pleased with the text that has now been voted on. I have been strongly advocating a forward looking and ambitious spectrum policy that would promote new innovations and global competitiveness.
I was surprised by the wish of some political forces in the European Parliament to support former leaders of Ukraine both morally and politically.
I was very glad - I am coming back to this because several speakers referred to the importance it - that all three institutions are progressing in this work. I am sure that after this very important opening by the Hungarian Presidency, we will not waste a minute and we will try to start the interinstitutional talks with the Council as soon as possible so we can find, I am sure, a very accommodating manner in which to manage the register together, the three institutions working on this issue with the same goal of increased transparency of European Union legislation.
I was very pleased by the statement from the Council indicating that it does not foresee any difficulty in joining our register, as Mr Weber has just pointed out. I am hopeful that the Council will follow through on this, because the register will really only be complete if all three institutions of the European Union have a common register and if this register is also mandatory.
I was very pleased to hear the Commissioner's comment with regard to generic drugs that there will be no danger of a negative effect on the patients.
I welcome Croatia's participation in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA). The main task of the EMCDDA is to collect data on drugs and drug addiction, and to prepare and publish objective, reliable and comparable information at European level.
I welcome EU activities and initiatives aimed at promoting labour and social standards in third countries, which constitute a guarantee that the growth of the global economy will benefit everyone in the current globalised context. I therefore support the conditions based on social values and human dignity imposed on third countries in order to negotiate with the EU. It is through this type of Union that we will successfully use foreign policy to improve the situation in the world.
I welcome Mr Coelho's report and his proposal on the need for Bulgaria to take additional measures, by preparing a special action plan with Greece and Turkey, due to the problem of illegal immigration on the Greco-Bulgarian border. I repeat my firm position that Dublin II needs to be revised and the Frontex operational office in Greece needs to operate on a permanent basis.
I welcome Mr Leinen's proposal and voted in favour of it. European environmental policy is becoming increasingly important in the light of the economic crisis and the EU 2020 strategy, and a sound assessment of that policy is only possible if reliable data is available.
I welcome S&D amendments to this report at committee stage representing greater transparency in the legislative process and promoting greater ease of access for SMEs and NGOs through the publication of road maps and an extended consultation period.
I welcome and agree with the rapporteur's observations, and I congratulate the CFCA on the work it does.
I welcome the Action Plan on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Applications (COM(2010)308), which aims to promote the development of downstream applications through certification, standardisation and coordination with the industry and other countries, as well as by disseminating information, raising awareness, implementing regulatory measures and increasing funding.
I welcome the Commission communication on the SBA review as it deals, to a large extent, with the problems which SMEs are faced with and for which European and national policies will have to come up with a solution.
I welcome the Commission review of the SBA and express support for the new proposals focused on further improving access to finance, enhancing market access and continuing debureaucratisation through strengthened governance and monitoring and through smart regulation and measures such as the SME performance review
I welcome the Commission's Youth on the Move initiative and the fact that it has not forgotten about young people.
I welcome the Commission's proposal, as it simplifies the existing regulatory framework and has the potential to encourage innovation in the textile and clothing sector, whilst allowing fibre users and consumers to benefit more readily from innovative products.
I welcome the Council's annual report and the efforts made to develop a European foreign policy. I consider it of the utmost importance to adopt a position which is harmonious with the Member States' foreign policies, since such cohesion will lead to peace, security, solidarity and conflict prevention at international level.
I welcome the European Parliament's decision to approve the Commission's proposal to allocate a further EUR 46 million in macro-financial assistance to Georgia.
I welcome the Rosbach report because it clearly defines GDP as an indicator of the economic activity of the market and production in the relevant country, but which does not measure environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion and social progress. A high GDP, even when calculated per capita, can be misleading because GDP is not distributed equally among the population, which is why it is not a good indicator of quality of life in a society.
I welcome the adoption of Mr Mitchell's report which is aimed at establishing Parliament's position in relation to the new financing instrument designed to regulate the European Union's development cooperation, based on the lessons learned from implementing the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) (the financing instrument for development cooperation).
I welcome the adoption of the Audy report on the mid-term review of the Seventh Framework Programme, taking into account the impact of the recent economic crisis, which has particularly affected the capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises to invest in research and development.
I welcome the adoption of the Casini report on the introduction of a transparency register common to both Parliament and the Commission.
I welcome the adoption of the European Parliament's resolution on the Small Business Act Review, which adapts the European support measures for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to the new context resulting from the 2008 economic crisis, and ensures that they are able to meet the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. SMEs were the first to be affected by the financial and banking crisis that has taken place these last few years, which reduced their access to financing and to the markets.
I welcome the adoption of the Sanchez-Schmid report concerning the development of the cultural and creative industries.
I welcome the adoption of the resolution on the review of the 'Small Business Act' with a resounding majority of the European Parliament. SMEs, which represent 99% of European businesses, provide two-thirds of jobs in the private sector and generate over half of the added value created, in total, by businesses operating in the EU. SMEs play a key role in innovation, research and development.
I welcome the adoption of this report which puts the challenges of vocational education and training back at the heart of the concerns of the European Union and its Member States.
I welcome the adoption of this report, which calls for a stronger role for the European Union in the structures of multilateral organisations (United Nations, international financial institutions, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, World Trade Organisation, and so on).
I welcome the adoption of this report, which draws attention to the neglect the sector has suffered and calls for recognition and appreciation of the diversity of species existing in the EU, as well as of the need to implement a modern and active forestry policy that is able to take advantage of the area of biomass and of carbon credits, as well as of traditional activities.
I welcome the agreement that has been concluded between the European Parliament and the Council on the extremely complex issue of textile names and related labelling of textile products.
I welcome the agreement which has been reached with the Council at second reading. I believe that this is an agreement which, although it can be improved, will boost the competitiveness of the textile industry, while at the same time providing consumers with better information.
I welcome the clear support for the two-pillar structure and I also welcome today's affirmation from the Commissioner of his support for that as well.
I welcome the compromise and see it as a way forward, but there are many more steps to take on this road to transparency, openness and greater democratic trust.
I welcome the conclusion of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union, Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), which aims to establish cooperation between all those sharing the Prespa Lakes basin, so as to ensure integrated protection of the ecosystem and the park's sustainable development.
I welcome the conclusions of the audit of the Court of Auditors, whose annual report states that the audit did not give rise to any significant findings. I also welcome the excellent performance and high quality that continues to characterise the annual reports on the activities of the Committee of the Regions.
I welcome the continuous improvements made in the last few years by the Court of Auditors with regard to the performance of all those in charge of funds.
I welcome the creation and development of the Small Business Act (SBA), which, in my opinion, provides timely solutions for the main obstacles encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as regards expanding their activities and becoming established.
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens.
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens. I am therefore voting for this proposal for a directive on protection structures for narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors. I believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient.
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens. I am therefore voting for this proposal for a directive on roll-over protection structures for narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors. I believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient.
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens. I am therefore voting for this proposal for a directive on the braking devices of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors. I believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient.
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens. I am therefore voting for this proposal for a directive on the installation, operation and identification of the controls of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors. I believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient.
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens. I am therefore voting for this proposal for a directive on the operating space, access to the driving position and the doors and windows of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors. I believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient.
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens. I am therefore voting for this proposal for a directive on the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles, as I believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient.
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens. I am therefore voting for this proposal for a directive on the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco. I believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient.
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens. I am therefore voting for this proposal for a regulation on denominations and technical specifications of euro coins intended for circulation. I believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient.
I welcome the emerging trend for increased funding for scientific research in the European Union.
I welcome the exhaustive analysis carried out by an external consultant, confirming that the financial statements of the European Court of Auditors give a true and fair picture of its financial situation, and also that funds were correctly used for their intended purposes. I also welcome the 2009-2012 audit strategy of the Court of Auditors, which aims to maximise the global impact of its audits and increase efficiency through better use of resources.
I welcome the fact that Parliament is particularly pressing for agreements concluded by the European Union to include mutual recognition of aviation security and safety standards, as well as better safeguards for the protection of passenger rights.
I welcome the fact that this text does not consider the inclusion of young people only through the lens of employment, but also through the lens of education and training.
I welcome the fact that, in the compromise that has now been reached, it is clarified that additional data requirements may only be introduced following a flexibility assessment and that the competence of the Member States must not be encroached upon.
I welcome the ideas that have been taken forward, through the adoption of this report, to enhance synergies between policies with an impact on territories, on the one hand, and between funds, on the other hand, in particular by increasing financing and setting up multiregional programmes. I find it deplorable, however, that the involvement of local and regional powers in the decision-making process is not being viewed as a priority.
I welcome the increase in companies' social responsibility and respectful attitudes towards their own workers.
I welcome the interest shown in the potential of cultural and creative industries (CCIs). I believe in the positive impact that their development can have both in economic terms, by creating jobs and contributing to gross domestic product (GDP), and in social terms, through the social and cultural integration of members of the public. I therefore welcome the intended support for the creative sector, because I think this is the right path towards the lasting and sustainable growth of the European economy, given the global situation these days.
I welcome the majority of over 80% received in the European Parliament during the vote in favour of adopting the report on the fulfilment of the Schengen acquis by Romania and Bulgaria.
I welcome the proposal that when measuring quality of life for society, much attention should be paid to health, education, culture, employment, housing and other similar factors, relating to the core areas of quality of life.
I welcome the recent adoption by the agency of a multiannual work programme for the period 2011-2015 in line with the EU 2020 Strategy. I believe that the multiannual work programme will improve cost-effectiveness through enhanced regional cooperation and the pooling of means under joint deployment plans. I welcome the approval by the Court of Auditors of the granting of discharge.
I welcome the renewal of the protocol to the EU-São Tomé and Príncipe Fisheries Partnership Agreement (FPA), as it benefits the fisheries interests of both the EU and São Tomé and Príncipe.
I welcome the report on European cooperation in vocational education and training and would like to emphasise how important it is to promote lifelong learning through initiatives and Europe-wide programmes in order to make it possible for workers to have a better future.
I welcome the results of today's vote, particularly in view of the fact that I was rapporteur for the document on the air transport agreement between the European Union and the United States, which was a document of particular importance.
I welcome the willingness of Azerbaijan to discuss these methods. I also welcome the role the European Parliament plays in advocating democratic values to the partners in Azerbaijan, including through its work in the EU-Azerbaijan Cooperation Committee.
I welcome the work carried out by the European Maritime Safety Agency. I also believe that the adoption in March 2010 of a five-year strategy represents progress in terms of its actions and improvements to future work. I therefore decided to vote in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Maritime Safety Agency for the financial year 2009.
I welcome the work carried out on the basis of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), not least in supporting the automotive industry, which has been affected by the economic and financial crisis. I am also voting for the decision to mobilise the EGF in favour of Belgium, for the benefit of workers in the automotive sector, through measures that form a coordinated package of personalised services intended to reintegrate them into the labour market.
I welcome this agreement on the protection and sustainable development of Prespa Park.
I welcome this agreement, the objective of which is to prevent, deter and eliminate IUU fishing through the implementation of effective port State measures, thereby ensuring the long-term conservation and sustainable use of living marine resources and marine ecosystems.
I welcome this initiative by Parliament because the broad consent between the political groups to initiate a debate on small and medium-sized enterprises illustrates their crucial role as a driving force for growth in the EU. The recession is making it even more difficult for small and medium-sized enterprises to raise capital.
I welcome this report as I believe impact assessments to be a key instrument in the legislative process.
I welcome this report which stresses that GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world; emphasises that GDP is a measure of production and does not measure environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion and social progress in general; underlines furthermore that it can be misleading in the sense that remedial measures following certain incidents such as accidents and natural disasters are treated as a benefit instead of a cost; notes that besides measuring economic development and productivity, there are other indicators that influence and explain the living standards in a country and that have not been quantified until now, although relevant indicators exist; stresses the need to develop additional indicators for measuring the full impact of economic activity.
I welcome this report which, if followed through by the Commission, should help victims of fraud.
I welcome this report, which deals with developing and deploying European systems to exploit Galileo and other satellite systems and their applications in the transport domain.
I welcome this report, which has provisions to allow a greater volume of euro cash to travel to countries which are due to adopt the euro to cope with demand. I supported this report because it improves the safety and training of professionals who transport euro cash.
I welcome this resolution, which warns against too much bureaucracy and red tape for SMEs.
I welcome today's resolution, which highlights progress in negotiations for an EU trade agreement with Canada.
I welcome your statement today on Bosnia and Herzegovina - that was a fine statement, but you have failed to appoint a head for the delegation in Sarajevo.
I welcomed the fact that Mr Manders considered other aspects too, such as the reduced administrative burden for Member States resulting from the transposition into national law of the technical adaptations required by the addition of the names of new textile fibres to the harmonised list.
I welcomed the report because 2011 is a strategic moment to draw lessons from four years of operation of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation (DCI). The purpose of this report is to establish at an early stage Parliament's position with regard to a new financing instrument for EU development cooperation, based on the lessons drawn from our scrutiny of the implementation of the DCI. I agreed that a differentiated approach to the diverse group of developing countries is needed, and that traditional financial aid may become less relevant for emerging countries. I believe that aid for emerging countries, while promoting sustainable economic growth, should still focus on reinforcing the partner country's fiscal policy and promoting mobilisation of domestic revenue which should lead to the reduction of poverty and aid dependence.
I welcomed the report because GDP is an indicator of economic market activity that has become a standard benchmark used by policy makers throughout the world.
I welcomed this document because Europe needs to take action immediately, especially where young people are concerned: rising youth unemployment is one of Europe's most pressing challenges.
I welcomed this document because the financial sector should meet the needs of the real economy, help to promote sustainable growth and display the greatest possible degree of social responsibility.
I welcomed this document because this report is a response to the Commission's Communication on the mid-term review of the autonomous European Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) (Galileo and EGNOS), which assesses the process and implementation so far and launches the debate on its future governance, exploitation and financing.
I welcomed this document because, at the turn of the century, the EU changed its strategy for the external dimension of social policy from a hard to a soft approach, i.e. from focusing on linking social standards with trade agreements to focusing rather on international cooperation and dialogue.
I welcomed this important document because, through Regulation (EC) No 2007/2000, the European Union has granted exceptional unlimited duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process.
I welcomed this report because impact assessments (IAs) are a key instrument in the legislative process, and one which European legislators should make greater use of in future.
I wholeheartedly supported this report to strengthen protection for consumers across Wales.
I wholly subscribe to what my colleague, Renate Weber, eloquently said: I do think it a bit rich for those of the same political persuasion as the ruling Fidesz party in Hungary to accuse critics of that constitution of being politically inspired.
I will be supporting an amendment in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) report which limits Member State EU contributions to the rate of inflation (currently 3.2%) or below, as suggested by the Heads of State of the UK, France, Germany, Netherlands and Finland.
I will close with a request of Parliament and the Commission to ensure that the Youth in Action programme does not suffer financial cuts or even abolition in favour of the Youth on the Move programme.
I will conclude by expressing my concern about the incidents and irregularities that have taken place in the administration of the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC). As a European-level forum for expressing opinions and reaching a consensus between the three pillars of our productive and economic life, which are so necessary at this time of crisis, it is a body that seems essential to me. That, then, is reason enough to demand that it be administered as impeccably as the other institutions.
I will conclude by noting that this year we must avoid a repetition of what happened last December, and try instead to find a balance with the Member States from next July's trialogue.
I will continue to oppose a European common forestry policy in future, too. I would instead like to put resources into research, education, information and innovation with regard to how to prevent the effects that climate change will have on our forests.
I will end on a positive note. I want to welcome the release of the three Bulgarian hostages who worked for the UN Humanitarian Air Service and were abducted from Darfur in January.
I will end with a clear message: after 2013, cohesion policy must have at its disposal much-needed and stable resources to be able to exist.
I will listen carefully to the Commission's response about new legislation. I am always concerned that we layer legislation on top of existing laws without looking at the enforcement aspects, and I would ask the Commission to address the issue of enforcement. I think in many areas we do not have sufficient numbers in Member States to correctly keep control and account of the transportation issue, in this case of toxic waste.
I will not forget this, because it was a very, very important signal for me. How can we increase the effectiveness of our investments in research? I believe that the contributions made by the European Research Council (ERC) and the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) in the area of research are interesting and exciting and could produce good results.
I will now give the floor to Mrs Győri to respond on behalf of the Council, although I understand that you have lost your voice, so a representative will be speaking on your behalf.
I will say one thing, which is perhaps one of the most unpopular messages that could be given in Europe right now. I will say it nevertheless, because I am firmly convinced that it is right.
I will vote based on the rapporteur's suggestion in paragraph 34, with a reservation about mentioning regions falling under these limits. I will also vote in favour of Amendment 5 for clear, strict criteria, which we regard as being of paramount importance in order to avoid difficulties when implementing the new framework.
I will vote in favour of the Ferreira report, as it is the only one that emphatically highlights the crucial importance of retaining a broad macroeconomic perspective which takes into account varying levels of productivity in Member States whilst simultaneously safeguarding fundamental and social rights through the 'Monti clause'. On the other hand, the economic package proposed by all the other reports only maintains further implementation of widespread austerity measures, which have had, and might well continue to have, damaging effects on economic growth.
I will vote in favour of this report because it highlights the importance of moving beyond the current greenhouse gas emissions target of 20% and increasing this to 30% in order to work towards the ambitious 2 degree Celsius objective.
I wish Mr Wessberg every success in the important office for which he has been chosen, and I am convinced that he will carry out the functions for which he has now been appointed with complete dedication and competence.
I wish to comment briefly on the creation of the EU's common foreign policy.
I wish to reassure you that this House has access to a lot of information, either because this information is in the public domain or because Parliament, as part of the budgetary authority, holds hearings with the directors of agencies, on the annual work programmes and on budgetary discharge, in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee.
I wonder about the usefulness of such calculations - what will they actually tell us? I am not as optimistic as the rapporteur and my fellow Members.
I would add that Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation does not exclude domestic workers, so no amendment is needed for the ratification of the ILO Convention.
I would also ask the Commission to provide an explanation for its rejection of Canada's social and employment policy proposals, which ought to be seen in a positive light for the sustainability chapter.
I would also ask the President to make it clear on behalf of the European Parliament that should any of the teams withdraw on human rights grounds, they would have the support of this Parliament, and that the bloodied name of Bahrain should not stand, this year, alongside the proud European names of the Nürburgring, Monza, Monaco and Silverstone.
I would also be interested to hear what form the discussions with the countries of origin (Tunisia and Egypt, for example) take and whether we Europeans are making headway in this area.
I would also insist on the need for the Commission to examine, with the greatest attention, the issue of social labelling. I believe that consumers should be informed about the social conditions under which a textile product has been manufactured in order to give them greater responsibility for the working conditions of workers in the textile industry.
I would also like to acknowledge the Hungarian Presidency - which inherited this thorny problem only in the final stage of the procedure - for having made every possible effort to make up for lost time. I thank all the Hungarian Presidency representatives for that. I know they do not deserve any blame at all, which is due instead to the stalemate that occurred within the Council between the different national government positions.
I would also like to ask the Commission to sit down with the Member States and work closely with them in this area and not to interfere in their national powers.
I would also like to call on the Commission to concentrate more, when performing impact assessments, on the transparency of the entire assessment process, to strive harder for its independence, and not to aim for just one solution to a problem in its proposals, but to assess multiple variant solutions to a specific situation independently. I would also like to call for a simplification of the process of public consultations, and an extension of the deadlines for submitting concrete proposals, including the possibility of submitting proposals in all official languages of the Union.
I would also like to call on the Commission to consider how it might be possible in Europe to improve the publication of all public procurement notices and to eliminate the administrative burden which prevents European firms from taking part in transboundary public contracts.
I would also like to congratulate the European Parliament and its rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, and also the Hungarian Presidency, which did an excellent job of pushing this so far forward, enabling us to have these very good results at this time.
I would also like to emphasise that there is no conflict between cultural and commercial use. I want us to have ambitions of a kind that will enable us to bring culture into this new technology, rather than reserving the technology for commercial use, which will be the outcome if we are not sufficiently ambitious.
I would also like to inform you that Mrs Koch-Mehrin has informed me of her resignation from the position of Vice-President of the European Parliament with effect from 11 May 2011.
I would also like to mention and to emphasise that we should not forget in this context adequate and all-round focused movement activity aimed precisely at this age group, which can assist in the development of the individual and contribute to better health in the future.
I would also like to mention specifically that this also concerns the issue of the criteria on which simplification and the reduction of red tape are based. CIP is already much less bureaucratic than the Seventh Framework Programme.
I would also like to remind our colleagues from all across the political spectrum that this is a trade agreement and, as such, we should be focusing on the trade aspects.
I would also like to say something to you, Commissioner: it is true that there are some Member States that will and others that will not be able to give this aid, and that, according to you, this will create disparity.
I would also like to say that I am not talking, as one of the previous speakers has done, about crocodile tears and hypocrisy and so on. That is not up to me to say, but let us say in a very neutral way that what has been said tonight is not necessarily consistent with what has been said in the past.
I would also like to thank Mrs Sanchez-Schmid for her contribution.
I would also like to thank all the shadows from the other political groups.
I would also like to thank the rapporteurs for including the proposal put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs to provide increased access to books for those who are blind or sight-impaired. I hope that this will be able to help these people to an even greater degree to experience the pleasure and strength that literature provides.
I would also like to underscore the profound need for additional investment, both in research into nuclear power and in other important research aimed at anticipating and combating accidents and their adverse effects in the future.
I would also stress the introduction of the reversed qualified majority rule in the Council when decisions are being taken that are essential to the proper functioning of this package.
I would ask all Members for their forbearance with regard to the current discrepancies, as the display is not working.
I would ask the Commission to activate immediately all the necessary mechanisms to compensate the damage to the Spanish and European sector, both financially and in terms of consumer image.
I would ask the President, in that letter, to remind those teams that there is a fine tradition of sportspeople withdrawing from events on human rights grounds - from Muhammad Ali and Vietnam to cricketers refusing to go to South Africa under apartheid and athletes to the Moscow Olympics.
I would ask you to be responsible, therefore.
I would ask, particularly tomorrow, for the Council to reduce the interest rate on Ireland.
I would be pleased if, in the heat of this debate and deliberation, we were to understand that there are certain loopholes that must be closed in legislation in the EU and also in many Member States.
I would be very interested - unfortunately, Commissioner, you did not mention this at all just now - in how you intend to involve the European Parliament in the issuing of the mandate. I have the impression that we would have a great deal to say on the subject of Japan.
I would commend the rapporteur on all the efforts made, but I call for greater consideration and compromise.
I would congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, which has resulted in a report enabling us to start drawing up the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the post-2013 period, which constitutes a challenge for the Commission and for the Council.
I would first like to highlight an initial point.
I would have liked to have seen stronger wording with regard to the common agricultural policy, and I would also have liked us to have investigated the possibility of making savings in the Structural Funds.
I would immediately stress the importance of including the European Semester in this legislative text, so as to gradually provide an effective platform for joint political discussion of the budgetary policies adopted by all the Member States, which will favour a robust and balanced economic union. I would stress the crucial importance of EU Member States' public finances being in order, as well as the need to adopt increasingly responsible economic policies that ensure stability and growth.
I would just like to point out, as every one of you has done here, that the process of selecting a new Managing Director of the IMF has begun.
I would like now to appeal to the Commission and to Commissioner Dalli, whose conduct during the negotiations was admirable, although perhaps the Commission did not explain his role in conciliating the positions.
I would like the relevant European bodies to take note of this situation, monitor it and take action to resolve it as soon as possible.
I would like to address two points.
I would like to ask what the position of the European Commission is regarding the restructuring of government debt.
I would like to be very clear, however, and I have already said this on several occasions, during conferences and also directly to the NGOs concerned: we are not asking for data exclusivity; we are simply not asking for that.
I would like to briefly mention these issues: we need a serious discussion; we need long-term cooperation and a long-term agreement with you: following on from the gentleman's agreement that is what we should like to do. We stand by the discharge procedure on the basis of the Court of Auditors' findings because that is the rule, that is the Treaty issue; and we also expect Parliament and ourselves to take into account the complexity of simplifying existing regulations and enhancing their transparency.
I would like to characterise the flagship Youth on the Move initiative, part of the Europe 2020 programme, as an excellent objective for the greatest possible improvement of the entry of young people into the labour market, with two main emphases.
I would like to confirm once again that a financial transaction tax will be proposed by the European Commission.
I would like to congratulate Mr Casini on the excellent work he has done. I will vote in favour of his proposal to create a register of lobbyists so as to increase transparency in the European institutions. I hope, however, that representatives of the regions, for instance, will be given due recognition.
I would like to congratulate Mr Falbr for his excellent work on the report on the external dimension of social policy, promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility. A politically and economically integrated EU also needs a social dimension more urgently than ever.
I would like to congratulate Mrs Merkies on the one-stop shop, the funding strategy, and the recognition of necessary risk-taking by researchers.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur because the report has managed to cover absolutely every aspect of this issue and this European policy.
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his fine work and beneficial cooperation on this report. I want to highlight again the great economic and cultural potential, as well as the unique nature of the creative industries.
I would like to emphasise in this Chamber the importance attached to settling unresolved conflicts, particularly the one in Transnistria. I welcome this step, especially in the wake of the failure of the Vienna dialogue conducted last month. I support continuing the negotiations in the 5 + 2 format.
I would like to emphasise my strong support for the 'Youth on the Move' framework, aimed at improving education systems and vocational training in Europe. I think that this is of paramount importance with a view to developing specific policies supporting youth mobility and facilitating a stable transition for them from the education system to employment.
I would like to emphasise once more that I think it somewhat absurd if ski runs are not included in the size of a ski area just because the entire mountain has not been dug up. As I see it, those are ultimately the areas concerned and they must be included.
I would like to emphasise that we attach great importance to safeguarding the rule of law in Ukraine, which is a country that we want to enter into a closer contractual relationship with on the basis of association and economic integration. A smoothly functioning, independent and transparent justice system is essential in order for this to happen.
I would like to end by adding that I would very much appreciate it if Members would not confuse the topic of the 'transparency register' with that of the 'code of conduct', as it is a completely different issue.
I would like to end by stressing that, even though I might often disagree with you, we should honour the work you have been doing lately. I am sure that your nights are not very long and I promise that, on the day you return to a more decent life, I will gladly invite you to dinner.
I would like to end with a few words as a member of a delegation that opposed the launch of enhanced cooperation on the unitary Community patent and to say that we opposed it, because we believe that the enhanced cooperation instrument may directly affect the internal market, territorial cohesion and the right of citizens of all Member States to have maximum legal security.
I would like to explain to the honourable Member that this subject is so important that I should have at least seven to eight minutes speaking time.
I would like to express my general thanks for a very constructive discussion, including the question of what is to follow in the wake of Fukushima.
I would like to express my thanks and to say that the Commission and Europe as a whole can be pleased with what they have achieved in this case.
I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to Mr Garriga Polledo for having prepared a comprehensive report, and for the impressive amount of work he has put into drafting compromise amendments. I agree with the rapporteur that cohesion policy, which has proven its effectiveness, should be given a place in the new Multiannual Financial Framework which is commensurate with its importance.
I would like to finish by saying that my opinion regarding the Sarajevo initiative, which Mrs Pack brought up today, is that it is quite true that five years ago decisions were taken on capitals of culture, but, as in science, a paradigm always has to be challenged anew.
I would like to give Mr Oettinger my support and encourage him to submit an ambitious proposal on the subject of energy efficiency in two weeks. I am very happy with the parts that we already know about, which are a mix of incentives and obligations for those affected. I do not like the fact that the Member States are supposed to set their own goals.
I would like to give my full endorsement to the directive on the charging of heavy goods vehicles. I would, in particular, like to support a provision which is very important for Europe's environment. I hope that the lower charges for vehicles which are less polluting will motivate owners of transport firms who have not done so to renew their fleets.
I would like to highlight Article 23 in the report about stamping out illegal logging. I should mention that implementing sustainable forest management is vital to preserving biodiversity in Europe.
I would like to highlight the fact that the implementation of EU funds varies between the different Member States, and it is important for the EU to understand the difficulties that some countries have had in taking corrective action in order to actively contribute to the wider uptake of EU funds, in line with the Europe 2020 strategy.
I would like to issue a word of warning, however: in our soapbox speeches, we are always talking about reducing bureaucracy. I would like to appeal to the Commission not to create additional bureaucracy in this area.
I would like to know how the European Commission intends to approach these negotiations and this draft convention, and on the basis of what mandate it will act on behalf of all of us, so that tomorrow, in the area of domestic work, the European Union can set an example and that we, too, can give expression to the values of the European Union.
I would like to know whether you meant that the rules must be adhered to, regardless of the situation, and that people should not always be guided by the circumstances.
I would like to know, therefore, what is to become of these programmes, at least as far as the Commission can tell, seeing that they are approaching their expiry dates and we should already have confronted the matter within the Committee on Culture and Education.
I would like to look briefly at the European Training Foundation (ETF). It is important because of its cooperation with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in the EU's partner countries.
I would like to make five comments.
I would like to mention briefly one other issue. I was part of a delegation to California and one evening, we met with young entrepreneurs and people who wanted to start new companies. I will never forget that evening.
I would like to mention three specific issues which attracted several questions.
I would like to observe that cohesion policy is not very visible in rural areas, despite the declarations which have been made on this matter.
I would like to point out that the European Court of Human Rights has already stated that in asylum cases, no one can be sent back to Greece, for example, because the conditions in prisons there are so poor. I wonder when it will happen that you cannot extradite someone on the basis of the European Arrest Warrant because the conditions in the prisons in the country requesting extradition are so dreadful.
I would like to point out that, according to various studies, young people who avail themselves of the opportunity to study or work abroad perform better in school, they are more successful and more competitive in terms of job hunting, and, moreover, in terms of their integration into society.
I would like to praise the very constructive work which we have developed in our joint working group.
I would like to remind this House that in March 2009, we adopted a resolution which took into account both the trade and the non-trade concerns.
I would like to repeat what I said in my introduction: I remain committed to the principle of maintaining a balance and complementarity between the two pillars of the common agricultural policy. I also intend to keep a strong second pillar in the future common agricultural policy.
I would like to reply right away by saying that the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General put a lot of effort into ensuring our safety in Parliament.
I would like to request appointment of a delegation to negotiate on behalf of Parliament and we should reach an agreement by means of a politically representative delegation for Parliament.
I would like to say a final word about the legislative fingerprint, which is a good idea in theory but not in practice.
I would like to say one more thing, and that is that Mr Barroso's statement about the possibility of cuts to the second pillar means that he does not have a real knowledge of the seriousness of the problem.
I would like to say to Mr Stevenson that a decision was made before I took the chair not to use the blue card procedure in this debate, precisely in order to be able to give the floor to all Members who asked to speak.
I would like to say to the High Representative that I sorely missed her voice during the very first few days of the horrors perpetrated by the Syrian authorities. I believe that the courageous citizens who were - and still are - demonstrating in Syria at great personal risk have missed your voice even more.
I would like to see a league table of Member States' usage of drugs per head of animal population, so that we can actually look at countries which adopt best practice and benchmark them against others that are not. I do not mean to point the finger, but rather to allow those Member States who might be overusing antibiotics to improve their animal husbandry practices.
I would like to see more money for research but there is no bottomless bank account. I, and my group, cannot support doubling the EU budget in one area without a commitment to showing where that money can come from elsewhere.
I would like to speak in favour of timely and concrete steps to alleviate non-tariff barriers in order to liberalise EU-Japan trade relations.
I would like to state that many of those in positions of responsibility in Hungary today are the people who took to the streets to fight against communism and for liberty.
I would like to state very clearly in this Chamber that the dissemination of ethnic and religion intolerance is an action which blatantly contradicts European values and basic human rights, as well as the traditions of Bulgarian society.
I would like to support the adoption of a clearly defined measuring system which will go beyond GDP, in the sense of complementing GDP in the context of making and assessing decisions. GDP is an indicator of economic market activity which has become a benchmark used by policy makers.
I would like to take up the subject once again of what is wrong in Greece, because I think that Mr Daul has a responsibility towards Nea Dimokratia.
I would like to thank Mr Mikolášik for the clear commitment in his report to achieving results and for the explicit references to the importance and the future development of the strategic reports, the impact of these reports and the way in which they can be used.
I would like to thank Mrs Jordan Cizelj for her comprehensive report and for her work over the last few weeks. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy and from the other committees.
I would like to thank all those Members who have spoken in clear language, stating priorities while, at the end of the day, agreeing on exactly what we have to do in a strategic approach to regulation with regard to the management of radio spectrum.
I would like to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, the rapporteurs Mr Pieper, Mr Mikolášik, Mr Vlasák, Mrs Sanchez-Schmid and Mr Stavrakakis for their excellent reports, which will help us to make progress with our work.
I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Committee on International Trade for their hard work and their support for the proposal.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Dess, for his work over past weeks and months. I would also like to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their hard work and the fruitful discussions that we have had since I began the task of preparing the reform of the common agricultural policy.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, for the report he has submitted. I agree with its assessment of the Commission's proposal, and I would like to make a few observations on the importance of such activities.
I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their help in preparing and drafting this report, and I would also like to decry the fact that some infinitely small-minded political forces in Parliament prevented my report from mentioning an academic organisation that contributed a study to serve as its basis.
I would like to thank you very much for your constructive support today. I am sure that in a few years we will be discussing this subject again in Parliament with the aim of extending and improving this first directive.
I would like to urge the Commission to speed up the gathering of research from all Member States, but also to support new research into antibiotics that would be effective for humans and would save lives.
I would like to welcome the President of Tajikistan, Emomali Rahmon, who is on an official visit to the European Parliament. I met with the President a short time ago.
I would like to welcome the observation of Minister of State Becsey, made in today's debate. I consider the steps relating to the work of the Hungarian Presidency to be important.
I would like to welcome the resumption of negotiations for an ambitious new partnership agreement in an attempt to overcome past tensions. I think that Russia must be supported by the European Union in its efforts to join the WTO, as this will boost trade and economic relations between the two partners and encourage investment.
I would like to welcome this report which draws attention to the necessity of broadening the system of vocational training in the EU since equal access to quality lifelong learning means better chances in the labour market and thereby contributes to fulfilment of the goals of the EU's 2020 strategy.
I would like, in particular, to thank Ms Grässle for her work on the Financial Regulation. I think it is very important that the proposal submitted by the Commission on the introduction of management declarations is finally approved because this issue is really about increasing the accountability of our Member States, which are responsible for managing 80% of your budget.
I would now like to turn briefly to the situation in the three eurozone countries to which I have already referred. I should, however, mention that, from the outset, many of the issues in relation to these Member States are discussed outside the regular Ecofin format, reflecting their specific characteristics as members of the eurozone.
I would particularly like to emphasise our position on the export of radioactive waste. I dare say that not a single member of the Committee is a nimby ('not in my backyard'). We are not in favour of irresponsible management and we want radioactive waste to be disposed of safely.
I would particularly like to thank Commissioner Vassiliou and her cabinet with whom we have worked very closely on this, and also the Hungarian Presidency, which had early years learning as one of its priorities.
I would particularly like to thank Mr Arsenis for his expert and professional work, which involved a long and difficult debate, because - as we are well aware - the forest situation is not the same in all the Member States.
I would point out that last October, Parliament, by a large majority, voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation on the indication of the country of origin of certain products - including textile products - imported from third countries, and that to date, the Council has not opened negotiations or discussions with Parliament, even on an informal level. I would like to thank the Hungarian Presidency for having included the issue among its priorities, but I would also ask for the debate to be accelerated, or else we run the risk, for example, of providing safeguards for European consumers with regard to foodstuffs but not with regard to manufacturing products.
I would say to Martin Schulz that I also have some questions about rating agencies and the role they are playing in the current crisis, but let us try to find errors and the sources of the crisis within our own ranks, and maybe not outside the European Union and outside its institutions.
I would simply like to ask for the negotiations in progress with the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which have not yet produced a conclusive result, to be given a chance to do so. That is why I would opt for a measured tone in relation to the situation so that we leave an opportunity for negotiations, which should take place very urgently and, I hope, reach a conclusion.
I would stress, however, that care must be taken when publishing results.
I would strongly urge Members of the European Parliament to support this science-based communication to the public, in order to reduce unnecessary fears and to reinforce our common efforts. I can assure you that the Commission, together with these agencies, is working very hard with national health and food safety ministries to support them in containing this outbreak.
I would therefore ask him to kindly withdraw the comments he made about me and thank him in advance.
I would therefore emphasise the need to improve reciprocity in terms of the protection of intellectual property, including trademarks, geographical indications and policies for the reciprocal promotion of bilateral investment, aimed principally at innovation and technology and inspired by the positions already taken in this field by the European Parliament.
I would therefore like to ask the EU, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council to try harder to support Member States, and to push harder for them to invest in this area, because it is only through the money we invest in research, innovation and education that we can really fulfil the objectives of Europe 2020.
I would therefore like to ask you, Commissioner, if it is possible that, without any increase in the Union budget, the creation of the infrastructure fund and new innovation policies - which will be linked to cohesion and to regional development, which I support - will become a Trojan horse brought into the cohesion budget?
I would therefore like to believe that democratic political forces in the Hungarian Parliament will correct all of the errors in another legislative process, and will amend the constitution to bring it into line with international law and Hungary's international obligations.
I would therefore like to congratulate the rapporteur on the result that has just been achieved due to an effort at finding a compromise between all the groups in an ambitious and encouraging report.
I would think that, if the EU were to introduce an increased de minimis at this point in time, it is likely to undermine the EU leadership in the ongoing negotiation process, sending a signal round the world that other countries, too, could increase their fishery subsidies on fuel, which would lead to a vicious circle, increasing the pressure on the world's fish stocks.
I would, however, like to express some reservations. I do not agree with excluding a series of actors from the scope of the register, such as the social partners and local, regional and municipal authorities.
ICP Forests and the EU operate one of the world's largest biomonitoring networks with the aim of quantifying these changes and helping to understand the cause and effect relationships. I have abstained from voting because in my opinion, the measures proposed in the report relating to the extent to which the individual Member States will be held responsible and will be involved do not go far enough.
ILO Convention supplemented by a recommendation on domestic workers (debate) 
IN FAVOUR of the following: 1. Postpones its decision on granting the Secretary-General of the Council discharge in respect of the implementation of the Council budget for the financial year 2009; 2. Sets out its observations in the resolution below; 3. Instructs its President to forward this Decision and the resolution that forms an integral part of it to the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the Court of Auditors, the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor, and to arrange for their publication in the Official Journal of the European Union (L series).
If 20 years to halve debt is the long-term perspective, what is the short-term perspective? I cannot imagine a longer-term perspective in this situation.
If 3% of the EU's GDP can really be earmarked for research and development by 2020, 3.7 million new jobs will be created, which would increase annual GDP by some EUR 800 million by 2025.
If Canada does not stop its action against the import ban on seal products before the conclusion of this kind of agreement, then, in my opinion, we should not agree to this trade agreement.
If EU asylum rules really say that a mere claim to be an asylum seeker is enough to create an obligation to accept them, then the rules must be changed.
If Europe really intends to implement the policies laid down in the European Treaties, including the most recent policies, it must have the financial resources it needs to fulfil these ambitions.
If Europe wants to successfully achieve the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, which place particular stress on innovation, research and training, it will have to invest in better qualified young people, opting for forms of education that are more geared towards future incorporation into the labour market and paying particular attention to knowledge that really prepares young people for the future.
If European cultural aspects are to be more prominently included, as is proposed, as an integral part of economic, foreign, security and development policy, it depends on what explicit form this is to be given.
If European economic governance is to be improved, the coherence and timely adoption of all parts of the package have to be guaranteed straight away, within the context of these procedures.
If European products are to be competitive in global markets, we cannot afford experiments that may result in even further damage to an already weak European economy by imposing yet more additional costs.
If European research policy is to be more competitive and in tune with the EU's economic and social ambitions, FP7 needs to be tailored to four major objectives: promoting the simplification of the framework programmes for research and cutting the burdens of administrative procedures; improving the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); strengthening the innovation dimension and intensifying the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility.
If Greece can demonstrate that it is genuinely committed to the reform package agreed with the European Union and the IMF, we will accompany Greece on its journey back to growth.
If I go to the supermarket and buy a carton of milk, I pay value added tax.
If I plant a grain of corn, I am thinking only of today, but if I plant a tree, I am looking to the future.
If Italy and its border police's security system reportedly lags far behind the ordinary Schengen standard, it is to be feared that newcomers like Romania and Bulgaria could soon also slacken in their efforts.
If Japan demonstrates a real willingness to eliminate non-tariff barriers, I believe the EU should enter into negotiations with Japan with a view to signing a free trade agreement.
If Member States fail to take effective action in order to meet their commitments and reduce their deficits - and these are commitments, remember, that they have undertaken of their own free will - then decision-making must be effective.
If Mr Gollnisch is charged over a press release written by the political office of the Front National, then of course this activity should be seen as falling within the scope of his EU mandate.
If Mrs Merkel and her Ministry of Health had translated the arrogance with which they frequently address other States into diligence and efficiency, some of the things that happened would not have done so. That negligence has had criminal consequences for one State, namely Spain, and for its most important sector, agriculture.
If Pakistan is allowed to join the ranks of those countries that enjoy preferential tariff rates - in other words, if it is to be included in the so-called 'GSP+' list - then the matter could be said to have resolved itself.
If Pakistan wants to increase its cooperation with the European Union, it should show that it is cooperating in the fight against terrorism in a very real way and that it is developing its rule of law.
If Parliament's security is so poor that someone can walk in here and rob the post office or the bank, and no one even gets caught, there is every reason to make improvements, and fast.
If Portugal is able to comply rigorously with the results of the agreement in the first few months, I think that it will be in a position to go to the European Financial Stability Facility and the International Monetary Fund and ask for a review of the rates within six to nine months. I think that would be good news for the Portuguese people and I think it would be good news for the European Union.
If Sweden is to belong to the EU's inner circle, we cannot simply trudge along behind EU critics from Hungary, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom.
If Youth on the Move is to enjoy better success, its implementation and progress will have to be closely monitored on the ground and by Members of this House in our constituencies.
If a 28th regime procedure is going to be instituted, in keeping with this report, this would facilitate cross-border credit-based transactions.
If a country chooses to use a fair election and a two-thirds majority to create an autocracy, the rest of us are allowed to be shocked by that and to try and oppose it. I quote György Konrád here, who says: 'In Hungary, a so-called majority knows how to create an autocratic regime in a democratic way'. That is true.
If a country like Belgium wishes to ensure that Europe is not allowed to make decisions on Belgium's behalf in the future, then it is high time to demand that those responsible for federal policy should recognise their responsibilities to their citizens, instead of intervening with the Commission for the retention of the index or of social policy in Belgium.
If a sustainable development policy is to have the desired effect, there needs to be enough information available for the decision-making process to facilitate the adoption of considered solutions.
If acts of terrorism and cyber attacks are not going to be covered by the stress tests, then so be it. You have explained why that is the case and we can understand that.
If all proceeds as planned, the Council will be able to adopt the text of the regulation in early autumn, and therefore the legislation will be applicable from 2012.
If all the Member States who use the euro want to strengthen and deepen the coordination of their economic policies, then that should be their decision.
If an objection is lodged, the interested parties have six months to reach agreement.
If anything, it is not Pakistan, but China that poses the biggest threat to Europe's textile market.
If anything, it risks increasing illegality, insecurity and economic costs.
If common sense prevails, this Parliament will vote for a reduction of the EU budget for 2012.
If consumers know where a product was made, they will also more easily avoid purchasing hazardous products, of which there are still very many, despite improved controls.
If courts in the European Union are now ruling that Dublin II is to be ineffective - in other words, that refugees are not to be deported to their states of first arrival - then we must ask the Commission how committed it will be to taking action against those states that are obviously not currently implementing the existing law.
If cultural and creative industries are to maximise their role as a driving force, financing facilities backed up by solid expertise in the characteristics of cultural industries and an adapted taxation system must be introduced.
If deemed necessary, control must be in line with what is feasible in practice in respect of the work process. I would also like to contest the vote on paragraph 9. During the very quick vote, I got the impression that we did not actually obtain the right result.
If domestic workers cannot work occasionally, sporadically or not on an occupational basis in this sector, then the opportunities for circumventing the legislation are already in place.
If ever there was an example of bureaucracy at European level, this surely is it.
If farms are to be enabled to plan with certainty then we cannot keep changing course every couple of years.
If globalisation has incontrovertibly favoured the proliferation of exchanges, we must fight against the danger of a uniformity of cultures.
If implemented correctly by national bodies, this international agreement will be an important tool for ensuring the long-term protection of marine life and the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks.
If it does so, we will return to growth, we will meet our commitments and we will be a great nation, part of Europe once again.
If it is not delivered within this period, the purchaser has the right to cancel the order;
If it is successful in this way, and when the Commission makes detailed proposals afterwards, then we will be on the right path, and we can all rejoice that farmers are involved in volunteer moves to protect the environment.
If it is true that a month's worth of greenhouse gas emissions in China corresponds to an annual 20% decrease in Europe, then this says a lot.
If it proves useful to carry out targeted activities in evaluating the consequences for human health in all areas affected by the fallout from Chernobyl, the Commission is ready to take action and to transfer responsibility for the coordination of the appropriate measures to the EU's Health Security Committee.
If it turned out that they had not been achieved, we would then have the possibility of together examining the causes of non-compliance and whether it was due to domestic or external factors.
If laws regulating consumer transactions were harmonised throughout the EU, small and medium businesses (SMEs) and consumers in all Member States would benefit.
If necessary, we must also apply extreme measures - various economic sanctions and restrictions - against countries and companies which consistently ignore them.
If necessary, we will have to investigate whether there will be shortages, to ensure that emissions trading remains an effective instrument for reducing CO2 emissions within the market economy.
If none of that happens, I guarantee you that that will be the end of Schengen, which would, actually, not be such a bad thing.
If not, your conscience and this Chamber will hold you to account.
If our citizens are informed, they stand a better chance of avoiding infection.
If people are detained in violation of their basic human rights, they can take action before domestic courts and, later, before the European Court of Human Rights.
If people were serious about wanting structural reforms, they could have taken up the suggestion made by David Cameron, for example, of going to the Council and saying: funding is to be frozen, but we demand that unused resources should be able to be carried over to the next financial year, so that we can continue to spend them on viable projects and to save money.
If production costs in Europe are too high, the global quantity of emissions will rise, due to increased imports of products from countries with low efficiency in terms of emissions.
If public lenders extend their maturities, that is not just a shuffling of deckchairs on the Titanic: it is taking the public lenders below decks to sink in the ship while the private loan holders are helped away to the lifeboats.
If public support is needed, the banks benefiting from it should, pursuant to the December 2010 communication on the application of State Aid Regulations to support measures in favour of banks, provide the Commission with a restructuring plan which is appropriate for dealing with the problem, in order, in particular, to consolidate and restore their long-term viability.
If so, we need a positive plan for it.
If someone is murdered and an innocent person is put in prison for it, that provides no comfort or justice for the murder that has been committed.
If such tendencies are observed, it is primarily up to the Member State governments to draw up the right strategies regarding training, remuneration and career opportunities to improve development for those in the medical profession, for example, which has been a particular focus of these discussions.
If such were the intent of the Sri Lankan Government, how come they have just released 200 000 Tamils who were prisoners? It is absurd to accuse the Sri Lankan Government of genocide. I would hope that the Member would retract that statement.
If that had been the case, legal action would not have been possible! This is the basis of the current Article 8. By definition, Article 9 applies to activities beyond the scope of this Parliament! Parliament now preserves or waives immunity according to how it feels: it waives it for political opinions in one case, but preserves it for suspected tax evasion in another, considering it an example of fumus persecutionis.
If that happens, I think that we will be able to show that we are making laws which are beneficial for our industry, for our consumers and also for us, because we do need to retain public support in Europe.
If that is what we are being asked to think, it really is unbelievable.
If that is what you want, then give me the legal competence to do so and approve the relevant jobs. I will accept everything you have to offer.
If the British Government invested more in the European Union, they could make savings on their foreign policy, in William Hague's department.
If the British Government wants to make savings, it can join the euro, it can give the European Union more powers and responsibilities, and it can make savings with regard to all those people working on monetary policy in Britain.
If the Commission now increases this ceiling, it means that only the Member States with a healthy budget can give this.
If the Council is also equipped with the register, this would therefore underline more effectively that the structure of Europe is made up of a government - the Commission - and a legislative body, consisting both of representatives of citizens and of states.
If the EGNOS system is to be developed further, priority must be given to the measures proposed in the action plan and adequate investment and funding in research and development activities must be provided without fail.
If the EU adopts strict measures on the use of antibiotics with agricultural animals, we can also expect changes to legislation in third countries, particularly because of the financial losses that would be caused by a restriction on meat exports to Europe.
If the EU can create an EU-wide momentum that stimulates these companies by supporting innovation and modernisation, we will be able to promote employment and social cohesion and, as the rapporteur mentions, make the European Union 'the economy which is founded on the most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-base in the world'. I therefore voted for this report, because I believe in the potential of these creative industries and in their promising future.
If the EU is serious about increasing recycling, reducing waste and limiting air emissions and climate change, then it must take action.
If the EU is serious about its strategies for improving relations with Russia, then it must firstly resolve these problems and secondly, give consideration to Russian sensitivities relating to an historical sphere of influence that undoubtedly exists, or which exists as far as Russia is concerned.
If the European Parliament is trying to show that it is a powerful, responsible legislative body which is proud to have achieved the Lisbon Treaty, I think it flunked its first test.
If the European Union works together on development cooperation, it will result in savings, elimination of overlaps and ensure better and more efficient spending.
If the Member States do not agree unanimously, it is not possible for us to impose a decision on those Member States, and thus we are fully respecting the democratic nature not only of our Union, but also of our Member States.
If the Parliament had not been so inflexible, then we would have a much needed update of the rules.
If the aim of finding more frequencies for wireless broadband communications is to be pursued and encouraged, it would seem appropriate to proceed on the basis of this inventory - without anticipating the result - by selecting, without any prior technical expertise, one or more specific frequency bands.
If the conciliation had been successful, we could now be jointly welcoming an imminent ban on the marketing of food from cloned animals.
If the costs of the umpteenth strategy will still only finance talk, I call on the European institutions to make amends to the dozens of small entrepreneurs in my region, Veneto, who have taken their lives rather than see their small businesses fail.
If the enormous amount of money paid in taxes were to reach small and medium-sized farmers instead of big landowners, agricultural factories, large businesses, monarchs and golf clubs, then maybe it would be possible to halt the decline in farming.
If the failing countries had remained outside the eurozone, their currencies would have fallen in value, leading to export-led expansions facilitated by low interest rates that would be set by their central banks.
If the forecasts are going to continue to be disturbing and we do not find the source of the infection, businesses will be forced to stop trading because of a lack of liquidity. I think the European Union does have administrative instruments which allow it to react quickly to such cases, so we should consider how to improve the system to make it more effective.
If the goals indicated in the Europe 2020 strategy are to be attained, vocational education and training have to be treated as a key priority of the European Union institutions and those involved at local and regional level.
If the history and literature of minority communities were taught in majority schools, and if minority education efforts were to include majority culture, communities living together would get along with each other more harmoniously.
If the ladies and gentlemen over there are to display their political posters, then I wish to have the right to permanently display my 'Vote UKIP' poster on my desk and for anybody else to display their posters.
If the latter is to be credible and efficient, it must be strengthened by the introduction of yearly fines for non-compliance with recommendations or the obligation to draw up a sufficient corrective action plan.
If the money is not there at the end of the day, there is little we can do in many of these areas.
If the negotiations go well, both parties will benefit: sustainable development will be promoted, child labour will gradually be eradicated and a more progressive form of social protection will be upheld. I feel it is pointless and detrimental to oppose this, and so I call on all the groups in Parliament to reject a priori a compromise text.
If the refusal to execute the European Arrest Warrant is final, it is clear that the person can no longer be arrested in that Member State as a result of the instrument.
If the situation does not improve, further actions are required.
If the southern part secedes, it will be necessary to show support for as peaceful a transition as possible. I would therefore like to express support for the Commission, which has roundly condemned the use of force against innocent civilians, who have been, and still are, the victims of intervention by the Sudanese army occupying this region.
If the substance is not there, we should simply say no. Some of our requests, such as access for our cars or wines and spirits or the opening of certain services sectors, are difficult for India to deliver. I look forward to more intensified exchanges on this with the European Parliament as we move into what is hopefully the final phase.
If the supply of energy resources is not exploited as a political tool, if it applies equal, transparent and non-discriminatory rules to all market players, if Russia makes an objective choice to make use of our existing mutual dependence in the field of energy in a collaborative way, based on specific, fair and legally binding principles, we shall be able to speak of a new era in the development of a united Europe.
If the tests should ever give negative results for particular installations, then these tests should have a binding effect on Member States, which would then have no choice but to close those non-functioning installations.
If their function has become obsolete, they should have access to similar jobs with the same conditions.
If there are serious problems with a particular nuclear power station, the citizens of Europe and of the relevant Member State will call for the necessary measures to be taken.
If there is a proportionality problem, it is not caused by the instrument or by the EAW framework decision; it is rather the result of the criminal justice policies in individual Member States.
If there is one person here who does not have the right to criticise Mrs Göncz, then that person is Mrs Morvai.
If there is reason to believe that organised crime groups are behind more and more crimes on the Internet, the same investigative measures applied in the detection and prosecution of offline organised crime should be applied, coupled of course with an improved coordination mechanism.
If there really is a winner from processes of monopolistic concentration in the air transport sector - which is what inevitably follows liberalisation and 'free competition' - it is not the passengers, nor the workers, nor many of the so-called 'flag carrier' airlines, but rather the major European companies in the sector.
If these issues are not resolved, the pact becomes stupid, as someone said.
If these reports do not get a majority tomorrow then we are always prepared to work together constructively to achieve a common solution for economic governance that takes social and economic responsibilities equally seriously.
If these rescue packages are quoted as the reason why risks are not priced correctly, then in practical terms this is like nationalising private risk as a fait accompli.
If these steps are continued, when Parliament puts the issue of the Council discharge on its agenda again this autumn, finally it will be possible for the European Parliament to grant discharge to the European Council with the backing of a long-term agreement between the European Council and the European Parliament on the Council discharge procedure.
If these tests are carried out under the terms that you are presenting, Commissioner, whereby the first stage is undertaken by the stakeholders themselves, the second stage is carried out by the governments defending those stakeholders and the third stage is undertaken by partners, who are really stakeholders, I ask myself if the result will not be to say, in the end, that all nuclear plants are in good health and are to be recommended.
If these trade preferences were to come to an end now, this would jeopardise further economic growth in these countries. I have not voted in favour of the report because, as has already been explained, some points in the new regulation are not clearly worded.
If these two factors are in balance, then this means, on the one hand, that people can do their work with adequate remuneration that is in line with human dignity and professional quality, while, on the other hand, it allows business owners to develop their businesses by following market principles, though tempered by the human environment in which this must take place.
If they are not, and are subjected to intensive deforestation, they would produce 25% of all CO2 emissions, a greenhouse gas caused by human activity.
If they are to enjoy uninterrupted connection, they must have radio frequencies dedicated entirely to them.
If they do not, they should.
If they were mandatory for anyone, it was only for those who aspired to join the euro area, and they were not mandatory for anyone in the euro area.
If things go wrong, if people are dying in Africa, the European Union cannot stay on the outside saying 'well, it is too far'. Your broad interest in the issues definitely encourages both the High Representative and myself to put together efforts to help people build peaceful lives.
If this continues, ladies and gentlemen, the euro area will soon have to rescue the European Central Bank, or simply fall apart.
If this directive expands its capabilities, any move by the UK Government to introduce HGV charges will be overshadowed by an unwanted indirect tax which the Commission also reserves the right to make obligatory in 2013.
If this does not happen, the security of the Schengen area is weakened, the credibility of the European Union is undermined and mutual trust is destroyed.
If this instrument is created, we will be introducing a completely new type of supranational law, which will be on the boundary between EU law and international private and commercial law, not to mention the fact that the mandate for creating a European contract law for consumers and businesses does not have sufficient support in primary EU law.
If this is not the case, the EU's already embattled citizens will have to rely on their heads of state to defend them.
If this project is to be truly effective, action must be taken on two fronts.
If used correctly, antibiotics are an effective tool, but I call on the Commission to introduce concrete measures to make their use more efficient so as to reduce animals' resistance to antibiotics, as this is a problem that impacts on the entire food chain.
If we Europeans consider peace, democratisation in the Middle East, the eradication of extreme poverty and the development of living conditions in Gaza as our ultimate goal, the appropriate means for the facilitation of this noble cause is not the flotilla, as VP/HR Ashton pointed out earlier today.
If we achieve the goals set out here, I have no doubt that we will enter a new economic cycle of growth.
If we adopted a different approach to Russia along these lines, we might harbour the hidden hope that democratic processes would be liberated to a far greater extent in Russia, with a certainty and confidence that can then feed into European politics. I am keeping my fingers crossed that this will emerge from the forthcoming talks.
If we adopted a tenth part of their policy we would be in serious trouble, but they have got one thing right - which is that these bail-outs are punishing the majority of people in order to reward some very wealthy individuals.
If we agree that the value of the European Union is much more than the sum of the 27 Member States that comprise it, if we are in favour of high quality, responsible agriculture, if we want to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, if we want to help our Mediterranean neighbours in their transition towards democracy, if we want to keep investing in research and innovation, if we want to carry on fighting climate change and investing in education, training and Erasmus grants, if we still believe in the cohesion policy as a tool for sustainable development and solidarity between our countries, and if we still support, for example, trans-European energy and transport networks - in short, if we still want more Europe - then we must call for a bigger budget for the European Union.
If we all want safety, then the right thing to do is to show a permanent commitment to safety and not just when there has been a core meltdown in three reactors.
If we allow our position to be weakened because of the weakness of the Council, we have not learned any lessons from the crisis.
If we analyse Mazowsze's economic situation without including the city of Warsaw, we see that the gross domestic product of a significant part of the region is a long way from the established 75% level, and what is more, it is even as low as that of the poorest regions of the European Union, which shows that further assistance is essential.
If we analyse the causes of the recent financial crisis, we can see that it is necessary to find mechanisms for control of investment risk, of the composition of boards, and of directors' pay, thereby enabling enhanced cooperation between public and private supervisory bodies, while ensuring their independence.
If we are going to debate and adopt new rules, they must apply to all countries - both old and new.
If we are not going to proceed in this manner, far from saving time, we will waste time and the problem will get worse.
If we are saying that we should leave the report on the table, and we should not have investigations into what happened between January and May, and indeed not open the door to investigate many allegations on both sides, what is the point of a report of this nature?
If we are sure about which of these we prefer, Mrs Malmström, then during the European Council in June the Commission will have to convince Member States to formulate a European policy on immigration, because Europe à la carte would be tantamount to the collapse of the European dream.
If we are talking about European integration or the future of these programmes and projects which we have in mind here, all these young people must feel European.
If we are talking about universality - I do not know how many minutes I have, Mr President - but if we look around, there are European Union Member States where we can see very similar cases. I will believe you, Mr Posselt, that you adhere to the principles and want us to enforce human rights everywhere - both in the European Union and Ukraine - if you table such a resolution for Bulgaria as well where prime ministers and former ministers are being investigated on absurd charges.
If we are to do so, then, in order to secure the lead in area after area with regard to telecoms and the development of broadband, I want Europe to have the best broadband capacity and the highest speeds, because then we will be home to the development of all the new services that will be crucial to the modern economy and to our competitiveness. I want Europe to be home to the next generation of Googles, Yahoos, Apples and all other companies that are manifestations of both competitiveness and innovation.
If we are to preserve our forests as we know and love them, we must be at the forefront of the fight to ensure sustainable management of forest areas and to protect them from the threats that hang over them.
If we are too over-protective, we will retain our old industries and miss out on the change and renewal that we need because we do not dare to take new decisions.
If we basically expect the Ukrainian Government not to interfere in the work of the independent court and prosecutor's office, what right does the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) have to call today for the European Parliament itself to get involved in such political interference? I cannot accept that we should pardon all the decisions made by the previous government in Ukraine.
If we can get free elections and a new government in place, the European Union, in conjunction with other international bodies, particularly the African Union, can help nurture this country along on the road to democracy and the road to economic recovery.
If we can take anything away from the crisis we are going through, it is the need to learn from the past. I call on everyone in this Chamber to recognise that.
If we carry on down the current road, it is the path to social and economic disaster.
If we cease to attach so much importance to the principle that some members should be allowed to speak in their own language, this will become less important for other members, too.
If we compare that figure of 50 000 out of the then 5.5 million population of the three Baltic States to that of the UK or France, the 50 000 Baltic deportees would have meant proportionately 432 000 citizens deported from the UK or 363 000 persons deported from France.
If we consider forests solely as a source of renewable energy, we totally have missed the point of combining sustainable industry and environment protection.
If we consider that, after Saudi Arabia, Canada has the largest oil reserves, this is probably also of strategic significance in the context of European efforts to achieve more energy security, and that is something that we should definitely bear in mind.
If we do not dare to set those priorities, we do not show leadership.
If we do not finally and regularly name and shame the Member States where the majority of fraud is taking place, we will lose our credibility.
If we do not learn the lessons of this failure quickly, 23 people will have died for nothing.
If we do not manage to make headway on these matters, the problems are more likely to continue rather than be resolved. I also believe that it is important to remember what happened in 2005 when we ought to have taken action and demonstrated that it is not all right to contravene the common allocation clauses.
If we do not reinforce existing mechanisms, Member States will continue to act alone.
If we do not succeed in stopping this in all the Member States and in implementing the directive uniformly and effectively throughout Europe, even greater damage will be caused.
If we do not want domestic work to remain undeclared, we should turn this work into a proper profession and overcome the usual stereotypes, which often present such work to us as valueless.
If we do so, Europe will be a better place: it will have more growth, more jobs, more renewable energy, more money being spent on innovation and more entrepreneurs. I think that has to be our target.
If we do that, we will not always need to call for more and more budgetary resources, but will be able to use the budget to produce modern policies for the future.
If we fail - and I say we and I really mean us all - they will simply say that 'Europe' has failed.
If we fail to transform Europe into an Innovation Union, the economies of the 27 Member States will, in fact, be destined to decline, resulting in a loss of talent and ideas.
If we had accepted the Council's final proposal, we could not have claimed that we defended the wishes of ordinary citizens not to have cloned meat on their table.
If we had had that in our constitution in Ireland, we might not be in the mess we are now financially.
If we have been unable to regulate cloning - one of the main sticking points in these negotiations - it is because the governments have not shown enough willingness.
If we have that, then we will get results.
If we highlight one particular project, the ITER nuclear fusion reactor, it becomes clear that this is one of the projects which is receiving the largest increase in funding in the next budget, in other words, EUR 740 million.
If we ignore the Romantic, almost monarchist ideas which pervade the spirit of the preamble, I would like to mention some areas we regard as being highly sensitive, in contrast to our fellow Members from Fidesz who are also Members of the European Parliament.
If we in Europe avert our eyes and say 'This is purely a Hungarian affair', if 26 Member States are not prepared to say, 'Friends, we do not treat people like that in our society', and if the European Commission says the same, what should we then say, as a group, to countries where the situation is even worse? What should we tell those Hungarians who are not part of the two-thirds majority? 'Terribly sorry, you will not have any chance to reverse these laws after the next two elections, either'. I find it absolutely appalling that all of us in Europe are averting our eyes and that we are failing to take action.
If we in the Commission and in the European Union had taken energy efficiency more seriously at an earlier stage, the question of the automatic mechanism would probably not have arisen.
If we live in a European democracy, then of course, the core components of our constitutions must be mutually agreed and must be compatible with the international treaties that we have all signed.
If we look at the idea of ownership, which has been mentioned several times already, then it is certainly necessary for all of you to lend a hand.
If we manage to connect 500 million people, our citizens and businesses will be able to reap all of the benefits and opportunities of the digital economy.
If we move down that road, I believe it gives us the ability to respond to that question and explain to the public exactly what direct payments are for.
If we really want these delegations to prevent development money ending up in the wrong hands or to prevent money leaking away into failing projects, then EU delegations will need more staff.
If we really want to prevent future crises; if we want to create a cohesive and responsible economic Union; if we want to be guided by a perspective of prevention and correction; if we want to commit to sustainable growth then, for this package to be complete, this directive was essential.
If we reject debt restructuring, then we need a better balance between punishment and assistance and the design of response packages which would make it possible to avoid pushing countries further into a debt trap.
If we sign the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention on Climate Change or any other convention, we must be able to tell the rest of the world whether we have done well or badly.
If we succeed in developing Parliament's own resources and establishing an autonomous structure under the leadership of Members of this House in order to develop a method that allows us to carry out professional regulatory impact assessments within the European Parliament, then I believe we will have achieved a great deal with this report. I hope it will receive your support tomorrow in the vote.
If we succeed in simplifying this system - and we have launched an initiative to this end together with Commissioner Barnier - we will also reduce the practical error rate in this area, too.
If we take a look at the first issue, namely, the origin of products, it makes sense to begin with the cliché that there is an ongoing crisis in the European Union that is due mainly to the fact that production industries, for example the textile industry, were outsourced to different countries in the Far East for easy and quick profits, and therefore production in the European Union has declined.
If we take a purely market-based approach, then we are clearly in danger of giving priority - or excessive rights in any case - to market players which we know are able to distort the market on account of their size; in other words, we know that small operators cannot always compete with them.
If we take an approach to problems that only leads to the Member States beginning to mistrust each other, to sowing mistrust between the various states, to creating and exacerbating differences and rivalries between southern and northern states and between central and peripheral states, the end result will be the decline of the European Union.
If we want Parliament to play its role of discharge authority seriously, the MEPs must be given access to more comprehensive and detailed information on the budgetary and financial management of the agencies.
If we want stricter rules, they need to be more intelligent, but above all we need more democratic debate and more cross-border discussions.
If we want the experts to accept the results of these tests, we must avoid the superficiality and inconsistency which characterised the banking sector tests of July 2010.
If we want there to be European economic governance, there needs to be a space for public debate and for European democracy, in order for this European economic policy to work.
If we want these industries to develop fully, we have to make progress on various fronts: skills adaptation and capacity building, access to funding, improving the business environment, support for cross-border circulation and new distribution models, maximising these industries' potential for regional and local development, promoting their spillover effects in terms of innovation, and promoting a creative Europe on the world stage.
If we want to achieve this ambitious goal, I believe that the financial resources the EU has need to be just as ambitious.
If we want to do something, then we should do so in a spirit of solidarity with all countries and with the involvement of everyone, and that means we need direct aid for the flood victims.
If we want to ensure that Europe 2020 is a success and if we want to turn the strategy that is currently only on paper into concrete activities, initiatives and projects, it is exactly this up-to-the-minute, advanced form of regional policy which needs to be implemented in all our regions, in order to achieve the necessary results in our cities, communities, businesses, research centres and schools.
If we want to implement the instrument efficiently, this naturally represents a transfer of powers from the national capitals here to Brussels.
If we want to prevent these agreements from interfering with the rules laid down by the Treaty, we cannot but adopt the policies and measures contained in the report by Mr Schlyter.
If we want to remain a relevant player in a globalised economy, then we have to ensure greater coordination between economic and budgetary policies, as well as greater coordination between the economic policy and the policy on the competitiveness of Member States.
"A Comissão recorda o seu compromisso em velar por que os Estados-Membros estabeleçam quadros de concordância, que liguem as medidas de transposição por eles adoptadas com a directiva da UE, e os comuniquem à Comissão, no contexto da transposição da legislação da UE, no interesse dos cidadãos, de uma melhor legislação e de uma maior transparência jurídica, e a fim de ajudar no exame da conformidade das normas nacionais com as disposições da UE.
"Algo lamentável", porque, embora a situação das finanças públicas nos Estados-Membros seja complicada, deveríamos ter feito tudo ao nosso alcance para reinvestir as receitas obtidas em benefício, por exemplo, dos projectos prioritários da rede transeuropeia de transportes (RTE-T). Senhor Comissário Siim Kallas, caberá à Comissão exercer um controlo apertado. "Lamentável" também, porque, pessoalmente, lamento este acordo mínimo, no que respeita à vontade de reduzir o congestionamento: embora o acordo proposto mantenha o conceito da utilização fora das horas de ponta, os métodos de implementação para os Estados-Membros são "frouxos". A Comissão deverá dar um impulso também nesta matéria.
"Convida a Vice-Presidente da Comissão/Alta Representante da União para os Negócios Estrangeiros e a Política de Segurança, o Conselho e a Comissão a apoiar os esforços para reforçar o processo de responsabilização no Sri Lanka e a apoiar o relatório das Nações Unidas, nomeadamente a criação imediata de um mecanismo internacional de justiça”.
"Cooperação territorial" é sem dúvida um dos temas mais importantes hoje em dia para a União Europeia. A necessidade de os países se aproximarem e de os laços entre os povos continuarem a fortalecer-se torna-se mais evidente do que nunca se considerarmos que 37,5% da população europeia vive em regiões fronteiriças. Por causa disso, a cooperação territorial prova assim ser crucial segundo diferentes pontos de vista.
"Finalmente", porque, depois de negociações muito extensas, chegámos a um compromisso, e o princípio do "poluidor-pagador" começa agora, efectivamente, a ganhar forma neste dossiê.
"Não surpreende que o espírito da mudança revolucionária que durante muito tempo inquietou as nações do mundo tenha extravasado da esfera da política e feito sentir a sua influência no sector correlativo da economia aplicada”. Estas são as palavras do saudoso Papa João Paulo II, que, na sua encíclica Centesimus Annus, retomou os temas abordados pelo seu antecessor Leão XIII na encíclica Rerum Novarum. A sua intenção ao fazê-lo foi analisar e dar o seu contributo para a "questão” social, que - hoje, como em 1991 - só pode ser resolvida recorrendo à doutrina cristã, ou seja, através do reconhecimento da dignidade absolutamente sem distinção do ser humano e do trabalhador.
"O Conselho considera que a transparência deve reger as relações com os representantes de interesses e que o Registo fornece uma base útil, sobre a qual é possível construir e interagir com eles de uma forma aberta, inclusiva e consistente.
"Por conseguinte, o Conselho saúda e apoia a iniciativa levada a cabo pelo Parlamento Europeu e pela Comissão no sentido de criar um "Registo de Transparência" comum.
"Tenho o prazer de vos informar que é com muita honra que damos hoje as boas-vindas a Bogdan Borusewicz, presidente do Senado polaco, Irena Degutienė, presidente do Seimas da República da Lituânia e Volodimir Litvin, presidente do Verkovna Rada da Ucrânia.
"Unida na diversidade” é o lema que todos partilhamos enquanto cidadãos europeus e que traduz o sentimento de pertença a uma grande comunidade europeia: uma encruzilhada de pessoas, culturas e costumes que vive em união apesar das suas diferenças em termos económicos, religiosos e outros. O meu apoio ao relatório da senhora deputada Schaake é ditado precisamente pela necessidade de incentivar o reforço desta consciência colectiva. A cultura deve ter um papel congregador a nível interno e externo, pelo que, nas relações do SEAE, a cultura europeia poderá ser o porta-estandarte dos valores europeus, que devem contribuir, através do diálogo com culturas de outras partes do mundo, para uma cooperação pacífica e um entendimento construtivo entre os povos.

- Segue-se na ordem do dia a discussão conjunta dos seguintes relatórios:
... e saliento que, nos termos do n.º 2 do artigo 3.ºdo Regimento, enquanto os seus poderes não tiverem sido verificados ou não tiver havido decisão sobre uma eventual impugnação, e desde que tenha assinado previamente a declaração em como não exerce qualquer função incompatível com o mandato de deputado do Parlamento Europeu, o senhor deputado Dimitrios Droutsas terá assento no Parlamento e nos respectivos órgãos no pleno gozo dos seus direitos.
...para apoiar a sociedade civil, para apoiar o Conselho Nacional de Transição da Líbia e Mahmoud Jibril (reunimo-nos várias vezes com ele); para apoiar a reforma do sector da segurança; para desenvolver os aspectos que a população nos disse que pretende ver desenvolvidos.
2011 é o momento estratégico para colher os ensinamentos de quatro anos de vigência do Regulamento (CE) n.º 1905/2006, que institui um Instrumento de Financiamento da Cooperação para o Desenvolvimento (ICD). A Comissão anunciou que apresentará as suas propostas relativas ao Quadro Financeiro Plurianual (QFP), para após 2013, antes do período de interrupção dos trabalhos do Parlamento no Verão, e as propostas legislativas referentes aos instrumentos financeiros de acção externa em data posterior, ainda no corrente ano.
37,5% da população europeia vive em zonas de fronteira, o que faz da cooperação territorial, com as suas três dimensões - transfronteiriça, transnacional e inter-regional - uma política fundamental para a União, ajudando os territórios, as regiões e os Estados a uma melhor colaboração entre si, na prossecução dos seus objectivos comuns.
61 anos depois da Declaração Schuman, cujo aniversário celebrámos há dois dias, necessitamos mais do que nunca de mais Europa. O que desejamos é algo de muito concreto: necessitamos da prevenção de conflitos e da gestão de crises civis, Senhora Baronesa Ashton.
A 100ª sessão da OIT teve início na semana passada.
A Alta Representante salientou que a questão da responsabilização deveria ser vista como uma parte essencial do processo de reconciliação nacional.
A Assembleia Euronest, criada recentemente, deveria constituir um instrumento de intercâmbio e de cooperação. No caso da Bielorrússia, é impossível cumprir plenamente este objectivo devido às medidas adoptadas. O resultado geral da decisão implica uma violação da Declaração de Praga e o abrandamento de uma possível evolução positiva em matéria de cooperação mútua.
A Bielorrússia continua a violar todos os direitos fundamentais e liberdades cívicas.
A Bulgária e a Roménia concluíram o trabalho exigido pela Fortaleza Europeia para que os seus cidadãos possam circular livremente no espaço Schengen.
A Bulgária e a Roménia cumpriram os requisitos e eu quero felicitar o senhor deputado Coelho por ter conjugado a liberdade de circulação e a segurança dos cidadãos neste seu equilibrado relatório, adoptado pela Comissão das Liberdades Cívicas, da Justiça e dos Assuntos Internos.
A Bulgária e a Roménia devem aderir ao espaço Schengen, uma vez que ambos os países estão prontos e as objecções de certos Estados-Membros são infundadas.
A Bulgária e a Roménia envidaram esforços consideráveis para reforçar o controlo das suas fronteiras, e conseguiram-no. As avaliações mais recentes são muito claras: fizeram-no em todas as áreas, desde a cooperação policial e judiciária à protecção de dados e à política de vistos e ao controlo das fronteiras aéreas, marítimas ou terrestres.
A Bulgária e a Roménia foram sujeitas à avaliação da boa aplicação de todas as partes do acervo de Schengen - controlo das fronteiras terrestres, marítimas e aéreas, cooperação policial, emissão de vistos, ligação ao Sistema de Informação de Schengen (SIS) e protecção de dados - sendo esta uma condição prévia à adopção de uma decisão do Conselho de Ministros da UE para a abolição dos controlos nas fronteiras internas com estes países, após consulta do Parlamento Europeu.
A Bulgária e a Roménia tornar-se-ão, portanto, uma rota e uma entrada para imigrantes ilegais na União Europeia, os quais, no espaço Schengen, terão depois liberdade para se deslocarem até Calais, o que aumentará seguramente a imigração ilegal para o Reino Unido.
A Carta dos Direitos Fundamentais da União Europeia confirma, aliás, o meu ponto de vista. O artigo 28.º da Carta estabelece que os trabalhadores ou as respectivas organizações têm, de acordo com o direito da União e as legislações e práticas nacionais, o direito de negociar e de celebrar convenções colectivas aos níveis apropriados, bem como de recorrer, em caso de conflito de interesses, a acções colectivas para a defesa dos seus interesses, incluindo a greve.
A China, na medida em que seja possível envolvê-la, é um membro permanente do Conselho de Segurança e seria de grande ajuda para encontrar soluções no país. Nesta fase, não posso afirmar que tenha havido uma actividade muito intensa com os chineses.
A Comissão Europeia deve também incluir os países vizinhos quando realiza os testes de stress, aplicando-lhes os mesmos critérios de teste estabelecidos a nível da UE e tendo em conta a natureza transfronteiriça dos possíveis efeitos da energia nuclear. A Roménia já iniciou o processo de levar a cabo testes de stress. A fazer essa avaliação, interessa-nos que se dê atenção à natureza específica da tecnologia nuclear utilizada na Roménia, comparada com as tecnologias nucleares utilizadas na UE. Razão por que entendo que se deve ter presentes os seguintes pontos aquando da realização e avaliação dos testes de stress:
A Comissão Europeia deveria aumentar a assistência técnica dada aos órgãos governamentais locais, regionais e dos Estados-Membros e proporcionar-lhes mais formação, a fim de incrementar as suas capacidades e de alargar os conhecimentos que eles têm das regras aplicadas para abordar questões relacionadas com a implementação. Além disso, os próprios Estados-Membros deveriam dar prioridade ao investimento na capacidade institucional e simplificar as disposições administrativas, a fim de reduzir a carga administrativa.
A Comissão Europeia e o Senhor Comissário responsável pela Indústria e o Empreendedorismo pretendem continuar a apoiar a política industrial e as pequenas e médias empresas, a fim de dar respostas aos nossos cidadãos também sobre a questão da qualidade dos produtos fabricados pelas nossas empresas. A competitividade da economia europeia também se mede em termos da qualidade dos produtos enquanto factor de protecção da saúde dos nossos cidadãos. Por isso, esta noite, no final deste debate, a Comissão Europeia renova o seu desejo de avançar com a marcação de origem.
A Comissão Europeia propôs aplicar o princípio da "harmonização total", já que as actuais divergências nas legislações nacionais têm contribuído para a fragmentação do mercado e do quadro regulamentar.
A Comissão Europeia só não tem imaginação para o que era preciso porque todos nós precisamos de reestruturar a dívida, de renegociar a dívida, de envolver os credores na solução. Por favor, Senhor Comissário, ponha a mão na consciência, demita-se que a Europa agradece.
A Comissão Europeia é uma defensora acérrima da consolidação fiscal como uma pré-condição para o crescimento sustentável, mas estamos, mais do que nunca, conscientes da sensibilidade do debate económico que está a ser discutido agora como o problema "relançamento versus austeridade", e isso foi discutido ainda hoje no Hemiciclo.
A Comissão acompanhou activamente as negociações e facilitou a coordenação dos peritos dos Estados-Membros durante a primeira ronda de negociações na OIT em 2010. À luz da legislação da União Europeia, a Comissão analisou os instrumentos à medida que se desenvolveram durante as negociações. A Comissão prestou atenção, em particular, a quaisquer pontos da proposta de Convenção que pudessem afectar a livre circulação dos trabalhadores.
A Comissão admite - e refiro isto com muita pena minha - que os danos causados para a credibilidade da Europa, devido às falsificações dos primeiros testes de esforço, são quase irreparáveis? Os cidadãos da União Europeia olham com angústia para o que está a acontecer em relação à banca.
A Comissão adoptou uma nova proposta de decisão sobre a mobilização do FEG a favor da Bélgica, a fim de apoiar a reintegração no mercado de trabalho de trabalhadores despedidos em consequência da crise económica e financeira mundial, que atingiu em particular a empresa General Motors Belgium.
A Comissão aguarda com expectativa a continuação deste debate nas futuras discussões. Neste contexto, os vossos comentários de hoje e as questões que levantam ajudarão a melhorar ainda mais a nossa compreensão.
A Comissão aguarda com expectativa a oportunidade de colaborar com todos os actores relevantes, em particular o Parlamento Europeu, de modo a assegurar a aplicação eficaz do "Small Business Act" a nível europeu e a nível nacional, nos Estados-Membros. A Semana Europeia das PME em Outubro será uma boa oportunidade de trabalharem em conjunto em acções de sensibilização para a política em prol das PME e para as necessidades das PME em toda a União Europeia.
A Comissão ajuda os Estados-Membros a atingirem estes objectivos através de apoio financeiro, em particular do Fundo Social Europeu, coordenação política e orientação política a nível da UE no âmbito do Semestre Europeu. O relatório Conjunto sobre o Emprego 2011, baseado na avaliação feita pela Comissão dos projectos nacionais de programa de reforma dos Estados-Membros, convida-os a melhorar o funcionamento do mercado de trabalho introduzindo mais sistemas fiscais favoráveis ao emprego e tornando o trabalho compensador, assegurando que os ordenados reflectem o aumento de produtividade, introduzindo regimes de trabalho flexíveis para facilitar uma melhor integração da mulher no mercado de trabalho, garantindo que as pensões de reforma incluem uma ligação mais directa entre aposentações mais tardias e direitos de pensão acrescidos, eliminando os incentivos para que as pessoas se reformem mais cedo e ligando os subsídios de desemprego ao ciclo económico.
A Comissão apenas concebe uma solução para os problemas com que se depara o sector das pescas: o abate indiferenciado da frota, ou seja, curar a doença matando o doente. É importante que se diga que este abate, feito no passado, sem ter em conta as especificidades das frotas, o estado dos recursos haliêuticos em cada caso e as necessidades de consumo de cada país, não resolveu nenhum dos problemas com que se depara o sector.
A Comissão apoia a abordagem comunitária. A Comissão apoia a maior ambição possível, no que coincide, penso eu, com a vossa posição.
A Comissão apoia igualmente a estreita cooperação com e entre as organizações internacionais, a qual - e passo a citar a OCDE e a organização internacional do trabalho - é fundamental para alcançar igualdade de condições a nível internacional e, em particular, para a criação de normas laborais internacionais.
A Comissão atribui grande importância ao funcionamento eficiente das agências da União Europeia.
A Comissão comprometeu-se a aplicar os princípios da transparência e da igualdade de tratamento nestes programas.
A Comissão confia no Parlamento para garantir que as nossas propostas sejam adoptadas tão rapidamente quanto possível.
A Comissão consideraria, por conseguinte, aconselhável confiar a um organismo especializado, operando a vários níveis, a tarefa de simplificar assuntos, determinar objectivos comuns e critérios de selecção e de fornecer informações a interessados no que se refere a programas da UE para inovação em tecnologia verde?
A Comissão constata com satisfação que a qualidade deste trabalho de avaliação é reconhecida pelo Parlamento. A Comissão sublinha que os pontos principais levantados neste relatório coincidem com as questões fundamentais abordadas na resposta da Comissão ao relatório de avaliação. Embora possa não haver um acordo completo em todos os pormenores, é importante observar que existe um entendimento comum essencial sobre as grandes questões identificadas, designadamente a necessidade de uma estratégia global para impulsionar a investigação e a inovação no contexto da estratégia Europa 2020, a necessidade de tornar o programa mais acessível à generalidade dos possíveis contribuidores em toda a Europa, e a necessidade de aumentar a simplificação de processos para permitir a todos os participantes concentrarem-se na criatividade, e não na burocracia.
A Comissão continuará também a promover o desenvolvimento sustentável, o trabalho digno, normas laborais e a responsabilidade social das empresas em outros domínios, tal como a política de comércio e desenvolvimento.
A Comissão deixou bastante claro que compreende que a indústria pesqueira não é economicamente viável nalguns aspectos, mas isso não é uma consequência do aumento do preço do combustível. É por causa de décadas de práticas pesqueiras insustentáveis.
A Comissão deve ter um papel preponderante nesta matéria, fornecendo informações sobre as competências e necessidades de cada região e as alterações no mercado de trabalho da UE. Além disso, é fundamental criar um ambiente empresarial favorável às empresas que cooperam no desenvolvimento e na aplicação de programas de formação profissional.
A Comissão do Comércio Internacional não fez questão de nenhuma dessas coisas como obstáculo a tomar nas suas mãos a discussão e a votação desta matéria e tomou em conta todas estas alterações supervenientes, quer por parte da Comissão quer por parte do Conselho.
A Comissão do Emprego destaca a importância de encarar a política de inovação de um modo abrangente, não apenas segundo o modelo de inovação tecnológica, mas também - mais do que tem sucedido até agora - sob a forma de inovação social e relacionada com serviços que ajuda a responder a alguns dos desafios que a sociedade enfrenta, tais como o envelhecimento, os cuidados de saúde, e as mudanças no ambiente, o clima e a eficiência energética.
A Comissão do Emprego e dos Assuntos Sociais realça o facto de estes objectivos exigirem que o orçamento da UE seja comparável com, compatível com e complementar dos orçamentos dos Estados-Membros.
A Comissão e organizações de defesa de direitos como a Fair Trial International - declaro aqui o meu interesse, uma vez que pertenço à organização - e a Justice, onde tenho assento no conselho, salientaram falhas no Mandado de Detenção. Foram referidos, com razão, problemas com a sua utilização para delitos menores, a inexistência de representação legal no Estado emissor, longos períodos de prisão preventiva, a inexistência de fiança para pessoas que não são cidadãs do Estado emissor, e más condições de detenção. A Comissão não considera que necessitemos de reformular o Mandado de Detenção Europeu.
A Comissão encoraja igualmente os Estados-Membros a criarem uma Garantia Juvenil com vista a garantir que todos os jovens trabalhem, continuem a estudar ou participem em medidas de activação num prazo de quatro meses a partir da saída da escola.
A Comissão espera que o problema do trabalho não declarado realizado por cidadãos de países terceiros seja parcialmente resolvido pela Directiva 2009/52/CE que estabelece sanções contra os empregadores, a ser transposta pelos Estados-Membros para a legislação nacional até 20 de Julho do corrente ano.
A Comissão está a acompanhar os trabalhos da Comissão de Veneza do Conselho da Europa sobre esta matéria e aguarda um relatório em 17 ou 18 de Junho.
A Comissão está a prestar uma grande atenção às pequenas e médias empresas (PME): aos 23 milhões de PME que constituem o tecido económico da UE e que são uma fonte de inovação e criatividade, permitindo que a Europa continue a destacar-se no mercado internacional.
A Comissão está ciente da necessidade de abreviar os procedimentos de registo.
A Comissão está neste momento a acompanhar sistematicamente todos os passos dados pelas autoridades do Kosovo no sentido de cumprirem as condições para o início do diálogo sobre a liberalização de vistos.
A Comissão foi um parceiro muito construtivo e cooperante durante todo o período de tempo, sendo-lhe também devido um agradecimento.
A Comissão incluiu produtos de peixe em conserva, transformados, nos pacotes de ajuda alimentar enviados pela União Europeia aos países a sofrer de uma crise humanitária? A Comissão não concorda que os produtos de peixe em conserva transformados são especialmente apropriados para situações de ajuda alimentar visto tratar-se de um produto rico em proteínas, com um prazo de validade grande e estar prontamente disponível?
A Comissão já referiu a importância da liberalização do regime de vistos. É particularmente importante para as relações entre os indivíduos que as pessoas usufruam da máxima liberdade de circulação possível entre a Rússia e a União Europeia.
A Comissão lamenta a falta de apoio à disposição incluída na proposta de Directiva do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho que altera a Directiva 1999/62/CE relativa à aplicação de imposições aos veículos pesados de mercadorias pela utilização de certas infra-estruturas (Eurovinheta), que tinha como objectivo tornar obrigatório o estabelecimento de quadros de concordância.
A Comissão lamenta a falta de apoio à disposição incluída na proposta de Directiva do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho relativa aos direitos dos consumidores, que altera a Directiva 93/13/CEE do Conselho e a Directiva 1999/44/CE do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho, e revoga a Directiva 85/577/CEE do Conselho e a Directiva 97/7/CE do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho, que tinha como objectivo tornar obrigatório o estabelecimento de quadros de concordância.
A Comissão nunca apresentou uma posição contra qualquer tipo de rotulagem, mas dissemos que todas as decisões que tomamos têm de ser avaliadas para garantir o impacto que vão ter sobre os nossos cidadãos em geral, sejam eles produtores ou consumidores, e essa é a posição que continuo a defender.
A Comissão pode, contudo, avaliar a constituição - como pode avaliar qualquer outro acto jurídico de um Estado-Membro - da perspectiva da sua conformidade com o direito da União. Escusado é dizer que as constituições de todos os Estados-Membros devem reflectir e cumprir os valores europeus da liberdade, da democracia, da igualdade, do Estado de direito, da dignidade humana e do respeito dos direitos humanos, incluindo os direitos das pessoas pertencentes a minorias, sem discriminação, nos termos do disposto no artigo 2.º do Tratado.
A Comissão pretende igualmente alcançar uma situação de equilíbrio de géneros e de ajuda a grupos desfavorecidos através do programa de aprendizagem ao longo da vida, nomeadamente o programa Leonardo da Vinci, que está incluído. Deste modo, é extremamente bem-vinda toda a ajuda que a Comissão puder receber do Parlamento.
A Comissão propôs a criação de um painel de avaliação da mobilidade no âmbito da iniciativa Juventude em Movimento.
A Comissão propõe o reforço do cumprimento do Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento por parte dos Estados-Membros, o aprofundamento da coordenação da política orçamental e o estabelecimento de requisitos mínimos para os quadros orçamentais, e especifica os mecanismos de aplicação dos regulamentos actualmente em vigor.
A Comissão publicará em breve as suas propostas legislativas para a reforma da política comum das pescas, a qual deverá normalizar os regimes de cumprimento e aplicação da lei nos Estados-Membros, uma área em que não existe uniformidade em toda a UE. Neste contexto, insto vivamente a Comissão a introduzir um sistema de sanções administrativas.
A Comissão recorda o seu compromisso em zelar por que os Estados-Membros estabeleçam quadros de concordância, que liguem as medidas de transposição por eles adoptadas com a Directiva da UE, e os comuniquem à Comissão, no contexto da transposição da legislação da UE, no interesse dos cidadãos, de uma melhor legislação e de uma maior transparência jurídica, e a fim de ajudar no exame da conformidade das normas nacionais com as disposições da UE.
A Comissão sempre entendeu que não há uma ligação formal entre o Mecanismo de Cooperação e de Verificação (MCV) e a adesão a Schengen.
A Comissão também parece não ter coordenado da melhor maneira a presente crise.
A Comissão também se congratula com o facto de o relatório apoiar algumas das suas sugestões dirigidas ao Parlamento Europeu através da Comunicação "Regulamentação Inteligente", mas estamos igualmente a par de algumas propostas muito problemáticas. A Comissão deixou claro na sua Comunicação "Regulamentação Inteligente" que não pode e não aceitará solicitações que afectem a sua autonomia na realização de avaliações de impacto - por exemplo, a externalização do Comité para as Avaliações de Impacto - ou que, de outra maneira, afectem o seu direito de iniciativa.
A Comissão tem cada vez mais poder. É tempo de pormos travão a isso. A Comissão arroga-se o papel de governadora de todos os países europeus e de decisora suprema sob a liderança do senhor Presidente Barroso. O senhor Presidente Barroso não foi eleito democraticamente.
A Comissão tem como objectivo, entre outras coisas, apoiar a uniformidade das regras de importação, através da harmonização das regras relativas às importações têxteis com as regras relativas às importações de outros bens industriais.
A Comissão tem uma opinião sobre a importância que se deve atribuir ao papel dos agricultores no que diz respeito a sumidouros de carbono, florestas e outras medidas, no combate a um dos maiores desafios de hoje que se coloca ao nosso meio ambiente?
A Comissão tenciona propor uma reforma ambiciosa e exaustiva da política agrícola comum que irá exigir que os agricultores dêem um contributo significativo para alcançar os objectivos da Estratégia Europa 2020. O impacto cumulativo de uma "ecologização” dos pagamentos directos e de medidas de desenvolvimento rural mais bem direccionadas, significa que a PAC oferecerá uma resposta mais robusta e abrangente ao fornecimento de bens públicos ambientais.
A Comissão terá também de negociar uma solução passível de ser aplicada a dois sistemas de indicações geográficas distintos: no Canadá "indicação geográfica" é um simples adjectivo; na Europa, é uma verdadeira marca registada. A protecção efectiva das indicações geográficas europeias implica o reconhecimento pelas autoridades canadianas do conceito europeu.
A Comissão tomará medidas para assegurar que as autoridades austríacas tenham em conta o impacto ambiental dos trabalhos já realizados a fim de garantir que, em qualquer alargamento futuro da área de esqui na região em redor de Damüls-Mellau, os requisitos da nossa directiva sejam aplicados em conformidade com as regras.
A Comunicação de 4 de Maio não só refere o restabelecimento dos controlos nas fronteiras internas, como também aborda muitos outros tópicos, como o combate contra o tráfego de seres humanos, a imigração ilegal, a reinstalação de refugiados, o asilo, etc.
A Conferência Internacional do Trabalho, que terá lugar em Junho deste ano, constituirá uma oportunidade para os membros da OIT adoptarem uma "Convenção sobre trabalho digno para os trabalhadores domésticos”. Este instrumento constitui um passo em frente para os direitos dos trabalhadores em todo o mundo, uma vez que alarga as normas em matéria de legislação laboral aos trabalhadores domésticos, uma categoria que estava, até agora, excluída dessas normas. A bola está agora do lado dos Estados-Membros, que devem empenhar-se na ratificação dessa convenção.
A Conferência de Presidentes, na anterior legislatura, criou um grupo de trabalho sobre a reforma parlamentar, que ficou encarregue de rever o funcionamento do Parlamento e sugerir melhoramentos.
A Constituição húngara foi adoptada em 18 de Abril através de um processo que levou a democracia aos seus limites. O texto entrará em vigor no início do próximo ano.
A Croácia pediu para integrar o Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência em 2005.
A Croácia permanece uma das principais rotas de tráfico de drogas para a UE. A participação da República da Croácia nas actividades do OEDT torna-se, nestas circunstâncias, um desenvolvimento positivo para toda a União. Isto significa que o envolvimento da Croácia no programa de trabalho do OEDT requer uma ligação à Rede Europeia de Informação sobre a Droga e a Toxicodependência e um intercâmbio de dados com o OEDT.
A Croácia é uma rota de trânsito de drogas ilícitas, que são contrabandeadas no caminho dos países de produção para os países consumidores. É por isso muito importante para a Europa que a Croácia faculte informação objectiva sobre drogas, toxicodependência e respectivas consequências, ao mesmo tempo podendo obter informação sobre as melhores práticas.
A Decisão Europeia de Investigação, parceira do Mandado de Detenção Europeu, encontra-se actualmente em preparação. É essencial que não cometamos novamente os mesmos erros.
A Declaração Escrita 0014/2011, apresentada pelos senhores deputados Konstantinos Poupakis, Richard Howitt, Ádám Kosa, Eva Lichtenberger e Cecilia Wikström, sobre um sistema de rotulagem facultativo em formato Braille na embalagem de produtos industriais, foi subscrita por mais do que a maioria dos membros que compõem o Parlamento e, de acordo com o artigo 123.º do Regimento, será enviada aos seus destinatários e publicada em textos aprovados na presente sessão, ficando os nomes dos signatários a constar da acta.
A Directiva "Eurovinheta" é uma das directivas que permitem, gradualmente, colocar em pé de igualdade o transporte rodoviário e ferroviário. O transporte ferroviário tem sido negligenciado nos Estados-Membros da UE Estados pelo facto de os utentes terem de pagar para utilizar as rotas de transporte.
A Directiva 70/157/CEE é uma das directivas específicas do sistema de homologação CE previsto na Directiva 2007/46/CE do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho, de 5 de Setembro de 2007, que estabelece um quadro para a homologação dos veículos a motor e seus reboques, e dos sistemas, componentes e unidades técnicas destinados a serem utilizados nesses veículos, e estabelece as prescrições técnicas relativas ao nível sonoro admissível e ao dispositivo de escape dos veículos a motor.
A Directiva 80/720/CEE do Conselho, de 24 de Junho de 1980, relativa à aproximação das legislações dos Estados-Membros respeitantes ao espaço de manobra, às facilidades de acesso ao lugar de condução, assim como às portas e janelas dos tractores agrícolas e florestais de rodas foi substancialmente alterada.
A Directiva 86/415/CEE do Conselho, de 24 de Julho de 1986, relativa à instalação, à colocação, ao funcionamento e à identificação dos comandos dos tractores agrícolas ou florestais de rodas foi, diversas vezes, objecto de alterações substanciais.
A Directiva 87/402/CEE do Conselho, de 25 de Junho de 1987, relativa aos dispositivos de protecção montados à frente em caso de capotagem, dos tractores agrícolas ou florestais com rodas de via estreita foi por diversas vezes alterada de modo substancial. É conveniente, por motivos de clareza e racionalidade, proceder à sua codificação. A referida Directiva é uma das directivas específicas do sistema de homologação CE previsto na Directiva 74/150/CEE do Conselho, substituída pela Directiva 2003/37/CE do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho, de 26 de Maio de 2003, relativa à homologação de tractores agrícolas ou florestais, seus reboques e máquinas intermutáveis rebocadas, e dos sistemas, componentes e unidades técnicas destes veículos e que revoga a Directiva 74/150/CEE(5) e estabelece regras técnicas relativas aos dispositivos de protecção montados à frente, em caso de capotagem, dos tractores agrícolas ou florestais com rodas de via estreita.
A Directiva Eurovinheta III permitirá aos EstadosMembros - se o desejarem - cobrar aos utilizadores das estradas custos externos (poluição atmosférica e sonora), a fim de introduzir finalmente o princípio do "poluidor-pagador" nos transportes rodoviários.
A Directiva contém um vasto catálogo de requisitos de informação a ser fornecida pelo comerciante ao consumidor na fase pré-contratual, em contratos no local, bem como fora das instalações e à distância. É muito importante que imediatamente antes de o consumidor fazer um pedido, ele tenha de ser informado sobre o preço total e as principais características do produto.
A Estratégia "Europa 2020” identifica os factores essenciais de um crescimento inteligente, sustentável e inclusivo (aumento da taxa de emprego, qualificação e luta contra a pobreza). No tocante ao ensino e à formação profissionais, impõe-se agora a adopção de medidas concretas ao nível da União Europeia e nos Estados-Membros, para dar execução a essa estratégia.
A Estratégia "Europa 2020” mostra que a política social é uma prioridade fundamental da Europa. Não obstante, é necessário fazer algo mais tendo em vista a introdução de melhorias neste domínio, e foi por isso que apoiei este relatório. O relatório exige a eliminação do trabalho forçado e a abolição do trabalho infantil, chamando ainda a atenção para a necessidade de dar mais destaque à protecção dos direitos dos trabalhadores.
A Estratégia Europa 2020 e a sua iniciativa emblemática intitulada "Uma União da inovação” foram adoptadas para fazer a economia da União sair da crise e para enfrentar os desafios sociais existentes. O investimento em desenvolvimento e inovação - incluindo em novas tecnologias como a eco-inovação, por exemplo - está no centro desta estratégia, e estão a ser concebidos novos instrumentos financeiros com o objectivo de obter um aumento substancial do investimento privado e de instaurar um crescimento sustentável e de longo prazo.
A Europa 2020 é a estratégia europeia que visa responder aos novos desafios globais da UE e dos diversos Estados-Membros que a compõem, sendo importante estruturar as condições económicas e financeiras que nortearão a sua aplicabilidade no período 2014-2021. O presente relatório visa contribuir para a definição do Quadro Financeiro Plurianual (QFP) após 2013, consagrando, face ao actual QFP, um aumento da dotação orçamental em 5 pontos percentuais, a manutenção das verbas destinadas à coesão e à agricultura e um reforço financeiro das áreas de investigação, desenvolvimento e inovação, energia e transportes.
A Europa ainda tem muito poucos programas para reestruturar o sector dos transportes utilizando soluções mais ecológicas com um impacto ambiental reduzido, e existe também escassez de recursos para melhorar a sua eficiência e o seu desempenho ambiental.
A Europa e os seus grandes projectos colidem com as restrições orçamentais a nível nacional, o que significa que um maior envolvimento do sector privado através de parcerias público-privadas é essencial para aumentar a competitividade e o crescimento.
A Europa está a viver uma crise. A quebra das receitas fiscais das regiões autónomas ultrapassa os 20% do orçamento, comparativamente ao período anterior à crise, o que é insustentável. A diminuição das receitas dos municípios é muito semelhante.
A Europa está mergulhada numa crise sem precedentes, que pode pôr em causa a zona euro e o projecto europeu.
A Europa integra um conjunto de Estados que partilham uma mesma matriz e este é um ponto a ter em conta quando se perspectivam as relações entre a UE e a Rússia, relações que se travam entre a mais relevante união política da Europa e o maior Estado europeu.
A Europa não pode manter-se ausente do Camp Ashraf: é um campo onde não só a política internacional é avaliada, como também a protecção dos direitos humanos. É nosso dever intervir nessa parte do mundo, assim como o é relativamente à Síria.
A Europa partilha de alguma responsabilidade, pelo facto de a questão da segurança nuclear não ser uma questão de soberania nacional, mas sim uma questão de responsabilidade europeia.
A Europa precisa de um modelo económico sustentável e competitivo que responda aos grandes desafios sociais de hoje e que garanta mais e melhor emprego. A iniciativa União para a Inovação introduz uma política de inovação europeia estratégica, integrada e orientada para as empresas e para as pessoas. O conceito de inovação deve ir mais além do que a inovação tecnológica.
A Europa precisa definitivamente de regras e de um quadro jurídico para o estabelecimento de requisitos obrigatórios que garantam o mais elevado grau de segurança possível, que tanto nós como os cidadãos da Europa muito desejamos.
A Europa tem também uma obrigação à escala global, Senhor Deputado Nuttall.
A Europa é o berço de uma cultura excepcionalmente rica e variada. A União Europeia deve fazer uso desse património quando promove a integração e a cooperação em países que não pertencem à União. Não nos esqueçamos de que a União Europeia é constituída por 27 Estados-Membros muito diferentes entre si. É importante cultivarmos e preservarmos esta diversidade cultural.
A Europa é um actor fundamental nos processos que se desenrolam a nível global e tem uma enorme quota de responsabilidade na produção de resultados que favoreçam modalidades viáveis de desenvolvimento. A União Europeia está na vanguarda da promoção das políticas sociais a nível global e apela aos países em desenvolvimento para que respeitem os acordos da OMC. O relatório do deputado Falbr refere também a importância da responsabilidade social das empresas e da sua assunção por parte das empresas da UE, que desse modo dão um contributo decisivo para a prosperidade social e a protecção ambiental e para o combate à pobreza nos países onde operam.
A Federação Russa e a União Europeia estabeleceram uma estreita parceria, de que é um dos muitos exemplos a luta comum contra o terrorismo internacional.
A Grécia continua a viver além das suas possibilidades, e a chave é que a Grécia tem de começar a ganhar mais do que consome e tem de ter capacidade para pagar as taxas de juro da sua dívida.
A Grécia, a Irlanda e Portugal recorreram ao mecanismo de ajuda, e, em consequência, sofreram a imposição por parte da Comissão e do FMI, de forma premente e através de "memorandos", de importantes mudanças nas relações laborais e nos procedimentos aplicáveis às negociações colectivas, que fizeram desaparecer as garantias nacionais em prol dos trabalhadores.
A Grécia, a Itália e Malta não estão obviamente em condições de proteger as suas fronteiras externas e os recém-chegados ao Grupo de Schengen abrandam frequentemente os seus esforços após a adesão. As fronteiras externas da UE têm mais buracos do que um queijo suíço e estão também a ser postas em causa internamente.
A ICP Forests e a UE operam uma das maiores redes de biomonitorização do mundo que visa quantificar estas alterações e ajudar a compreender as relações de causa-efeito.
A Irlanda corre um considerável risco nuclear devido às centrais nucleares da costa ocidental da Grã-Bretanha; Sellafield é a mais famosa. A 2 de Maio, foram detidos cinco homens no exterior da central nuclear de Sellafield, ao abrigo da lei do terrorismo, e o governo irlandês ainda não comunicou se o governo britânico partilhou consigo todas as informações de segurança acerca do incidente.
A Juventude em Movimento é uma das iniciativas emblemáticas da Estratégia "Europa 2020” para a promoção de um crescimento económico inteligente, sustentável e inclusivo. A iniciativa define caminhos fundamentais para aumentar a educação e a formação dos jovens através da mobilidade e, consequentemente, para facilitar a sua entrada no mercado de trabalho.
A Juventude em Movimento é uma iniciativa fantástica, e eu, colocando-me firmemente ao lado do meu grupo, apoio-a inteiramente.
A Mongólia deve continuar a receber o nosso apoio, não só no contexto dos programas de ajuda, mas mediante uma presença directa da União na capital mongol, através de uma delegação própria, como um sinal de que a Europa não está indiferente ao destino da Mongólia; os interesses europeus não devem continuar a ser tratados por uma delegação em Pequim.
A OIT tem um papel fundamental no sistema internacional, pois contribui para a construção de um consenso em torno das normas laborais.
A Organização Internacional do Trabalho (OIT) está actualmente a trabalhar na elaboração de uma convenção sobre os trabalhadores domésticos. A adopção desta Convenção da OIT sobre os trabalhadores domésticos constituirá um elemento essencial para garantir o respeito dos direitos humanos, sociais e laborais desses trabalhadores. O trabalho doméstico representa entre 5% e 9% do emprego total.
A PAC foi sempre actualizada com dois objectivos principais em mente: garantir um rendimento aos agricultores europeus e fazer face a um orçamento da UE cada vez mais reduzido, sem esquecer um vasto leque de outros objectivos relacionados com a qualidade da produção, do ambiente, da biodiversidade e dos recursos hídricos.
A PAC no horizonte 2020: Responder aos desafios do futuro em matéria de alimentação, recursos naturais e territoriais (
A PAC não deve ser medida unicamente em termos de despesa porque, além dos bens e serviços que fornece, há que deixar claro - hoje mais do que nunca - que 1 euro investido na agricultura gera 10 euros de riqueza no sector agro-alimentar.
A Parceria Oriental e a Assembleia Euronest constituem uma boa plataforma para esse diálogo, e sinto que novos ventos sopram do Azerbaijão, com um desejo renovado de diálogo político. A Comissão Parlamentar de Cooperação, que se deslocará ao Azerbaijão em Junho, deverá aproveitar essa oportunidade para abordar a questão dos direitos humanos e para estabelecer um diálogo mais coerente com o país.
A Política Externa e de Segurança Comum é sempre um grande problema na UE. Por um lado, tradicionalmente, confia-se nas forças dos grandes Estados, sendo que França e Reino Unido em particular, ainda se consideram grandes potências, o que é visível na sua abordagem para resolver problemas do domínio da política externa.
A Política de Coesão da União Europeia (UE) insere-se num quadro de solidariedade que engloba os 27 Estados-Membros e as suas 271 regiões e visa terminar com as disparidades económicas e sociais existentes no seio da UE. O presente relatório, elaborado por Oldřich Vlasák, pretende dar continuidade ao anterior denominado A Dimensão Urbana da Política de Coesão no novo período de programação. O papel das cidades - onde vive cerca de 80% da população europeia - enquanto fonte de criação de riqueza e pólo de desenvolvimento social e económico é inquestionável.
A Polónia não pode dar-se ao luxo de aumentar o objectivo de redução das emissões de dióxido de carbono para 30%. Uma das soluções possíveis poderia passar pela adesão, de forma voluntária, dos EstadosMembros a um clube de redução das emissões de CO2.
A Presidência colocou, portanto, a situação actual da adesão da Bulgária e da Roménia a Schengen na ordem do dia da reunião do Conselho JAI (Justiça e Assuntos Internos) de 24 e 25 de Fevereiro.
A Presidência em exercício do Conselho e a Senhora Comissária Cecilia Malmström foram unânimes em afirmar que estes dois países cumprem os requisitos técnicos e jurídicos, e junto a minha voz às suas.
A Presidência húngara opor-se-á a qualquer tentativa no sentido contrário.
A Presidência tenciona iniciar, na sessão do Conselho de 12 de Maio de 2011, o debate sobre as várias ideias relativas ao acervo de Schengen que foram apresentadas pela Comissão na sua comunicação de 4 de Maio sobre a migração. O Conselho espera, em particular, analisar as sugestões da Comissão para um mecanismo relativo à reintrodução coordenada e temporária de controlos como medida de último recurso, com base em critérios objectivos e no respeito da metodologia comunitária. O Conselho terá igualmente a oportunidade de debater a forma como deverão prosseguir os trabalhos de revisão do mecanismo de avaliação de Schengen, de modo a assegurar uma aplicação mais eficiente e uniforme do acervo.
A Professora Dagmar Lieblová está em Estrasburgo, acompanhada por 28 estudantes de Praga e Hamburgo, que trabalharam juntos num projecto de investigação de dois anos sobre a transferência de trabalhadores forçados checos de Hamburgo para o campo de concentração de Theresienstadt.
A República da Croácia participará, assim, no programa de trabalho do Observatório, passará a estar ligada à Rede Europeia de Informação sobre a Droga e a Toxicodependência (REITOX) e partilhará dados com o OEDT. A República da Croácia é uma rota de trânsito de drogas ilícitas provenientes dos países de produção e continua a ser uma das principais rotas de tráfico de droga para a UE.
A República da Croácia requereu a sua participação nas actividades do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência (OEDT), criado em 1993 e com sede em Lisboa.
A Roménia e a Bulgária adoptaram o acervo de Schengen quando aderiram à UE em 2007. A integração destes países no espaço Schengen é aceitável, desde que cumpram determinados requisitos técnicos destacados no processo relevante.
A Roménia e a Bulgária adoptaram o acervo de Schengen quando aderiram à UE, em 2007. A condição essencial para que o Conselho tome uma decisão favorável à supressão de controlos nas fronteiras internas com estes Estados-Membros é a confirmação, no quadro dos procedimentos de avaliação, de que os novos Estados-Membros cumpriram a exigência de aplicar todas as partes do acervo de Schengen: protecção de dados, Sistema de Informação Schengen, fronteiras aéreas, fronteiras terrestres, fronteiras marítimas, cooperação policial e vistos.
A Roménia encontra-se em último lugar na tabela da liga europeia para a qualidade e quantidade dos serviços médicos.
A Roménia gere uma das maiores fronteiras externas da União Europeia, razão pela qual desenvolveu o mais avançado sistema integrado de segurança, em conformidade com as disposições do acervo de Schengen. A Roménia e a agência Frontex fortaleceram a sua parceria.
A Rússia partilha com a UE a responsabilidade pela manutenção da estabilidade a nível mundial. A cooperação reforçada e as relações de boa vizinhança entre a União Europeia e a Rússia revestem-se da maior importância para a estabilidade, a segurança e a prosperidade da Europa e não só. Muitos desafios a nível internacional, nomeadamente em relação ao Médio Oriente, à Líbia, ao Irão, ao terrorismo, à segurança energética, às alterações climáticas e à crise financeira, não serão vencidos sem relações responsáveis e de cooperação com a Rússia.
A Rússia tem de respeitar a soberania e a integridade territorial dos seus vizinhos.
A Rússia é o terceiro maior parceiro comercial da UE. As exportações da UE para a Rússia atingem um valor total de 65,6 mil milhões de euros.
A Rússia é, evidentemente, um enorme mercado para as mercadorias da UE, sendo igualmente um importante fornecedor de petróleo e gás natural aos Estados-Membros da UE. Muito embora as relações entre a Rússia e a UE tenham melhorado constantemente nos últimos anos, as Partes envolvidas continuam a manter uma certa reserva e uma certa distância.
A Senhora Baronesa Ashton sabe que apoiamos a sua política de direitos humanos, e fez escolhas claras em relação aos rebeldes em Benghasi, e com razão. Faça agora o mesmo em relação a Omar al-Bashir, pois o povo do Sul do Sudão merece um forte apoio da nossa parte.
A Senhora Comissária Malmström referiu a confiança. Este é o ponto central dessa confiança. Deve ser dada a oportunidade aos governos de ambos os países de responderem ao desafio e de provarem que podem proteger eficazmente as fronteiras da Europa.
A Senhora Comissária comentou igualmente a questão do novo mecanismo. À luz da cimeira, este o debate sobre o mecanismo fortalece a percepção da confiança - relembro, ainda assim, que o artigo 23.º do Código das Fronteiras Schengen prevê um mecanismo para situações excepcionais -, ou limita-se a causar novas preocupações nos Estados-Membros e em todos os Estados do espaço Schengen?
A Sérvia, que se caracteriza por uma tradição cristã, tem repetidamente mostrado boas intenções. Uma barreira foi demolida com a extradição de Mladič, mas o Kosovo não tem de ser a próxima.
A UE 2020 é consensual, as suas prioridades são claras e os objectivos mensuráveis.
A UE adoptou uma abordagem activa, mobilizando mais recursos da comunidade internacional para permitir a conclusão de um excelente trabalho em Chernobyl, estando nós a prosseguir os nossos esforços nessa direcção com o nosso próprio contributo. A Comissão é a maior contribuinte para o Fundo de Protecção de Chernobyl, tendo nós prometido mais 110 milhões de EUR, na conferência de doadores realizada em Kiev no passado mês de Abril, que reuniu promessas de mais uns 550 EUR.
A UE conseguiu dissociar o seu crescimento económico das suas emissões. O PIB da UE cresceu 45% desde 1990, enquanto as emissões foram reduzidos em 13%, e isto inclui os dados de 2010, isto é, dados após a nossa saída da crise. A indústria transformadora da União Europeia cresceu mais de 30% no mesmo período.
A UE deu um passo importante com a sua decisão política. O relatório constitui um exame intercalar desta iniciativa emblemática, em que se avaliam o processo e a implementação até à data e se lança um debate sobre a sua governação, exploração e financiamento futuros no quadro do sistema da UE. Na minha opinião, é necessário lançar uma análise exaustiva para identificar com maior precisão os cenários de evolução possíveis e os meios de operação e de exploração para além de 2013.
A UE deve continuar a desenvolver os seus objectivos de política externa e promover os seus valores e interesses à escala mundial, com o propósito genérico de contribuir para a paz, a segurança, a solidariedade, a prevenção de conflitos, a promoção da democracia, a protecção dos direitos humanos, a igualdade dos géneros, o respeito do direito internacional, o apoio às instituições internacionais, o multilateralismo eficaz e o respeito mútuo entre as nações, o desenvolvimento sustentável, o comércio livre e justo e a erradicação da pobreza.
A UE e os Estados Unidos precisam de trabalhar em conjunto, não na violação dos direitos humanos, mas na respostas às mais prementes ameaças do nosso mundo.
A UE goza de boa reputação no que respeita ao diálogo internacional sobre questões sociais. É considerada um parceiro compreensivo e de confiança neste domínio.
A UE iniciou conversações sobre o acordo económico e comercial global com o Canadá em 2009. O potencial acordo abrange um largo espectro de tópicos: comércio de bens e serviços, direitos de propriedade intelectual, contratos públicos, cooperação regulamentar, investimento, migração temporária, política de concorrência e emprego e normas ambientais.
A UE lançou o projecto EGNOS (e Galileo) com o intuito de fornecer sinais garantidos para utilização civil e assegurar à indústria europeia, a todos os níveis, a possibilidade de competir neste mercado estratégico em crescimento. A quota de mercado actual da Europa, de 25%, está aquém das expectativas. O EGNOS é compatível com o sistema GPS, mas oferecerá mais possibilidades quando o Galileo ficar operacional em 2013, tendo agora um nível de exactidão dez vezes superior ao do GPS.
A UE opõe-se à tortura e à pena de morte desde há muito tempo, e isso continua a ser verdade no caso de al-Nashiri. Há dois princípios importantes que não podemos esquecer: um "não" incondicional à pena de morte, e o facto de a guerra contra o terrorismo ter de ser também uma guerra contra as causas do terrorismo.
A UE tem a oportunidade de desempenhar um papel pacificador, de ajudar à estabilidade na região e de reforçar não só a sua posição de maior doadora do mundo, mas também a sua posição política e, sobretudo, de ajudar os habitantes deste país.
A UE tem de se empenhar para ultrapassar o fosso digital que origina enormes disparidades na Europa - entre zonas urbanas e rurais em particular -, a fim de garantir que todos os cidadãos tenham igual acesso aos serviços, sobretudo aos que envolvem novas tecnologias.
A UE tem de ser muito clara neste ponto: acusem-nos ou libertem-nos. O senhor Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri está detido pelos Estados Unidos há nove anos e alega ter estado detido secretamente pela CIA num centro de detenção secreto, na Polónia.
A UE é o maior contribuinte para a ajuda ao desenvolvimento e o mais importante bloco comercial, mas a representação da União Europeia, enquanto tal, nas organizações multilaterais permanece fragmentada.
A UE é o principal parceiro comercial da Índia, sendo que o comércio de bens e serviços em 2009-2010 contabilizou aproximadamente 84 mil milhões de euros e que a UE é responsável por 20,15% do total das exportações da Índia e por 13,32% do total das suas importações, mas que, por outro lado, a Índia é responsável por 2,6% do total das exportações da UE e por 2,2% do total das suas importações. Por este facto, não podemos deixar de ter em consideração que os objectivos da política comercial comum devem ser plenamente coordenados com os objectivos globais da União Europeia e que, segundo o Tratado sobre o Funcionamento da União Europeia, a política comercial comum da União deve ser conduzida de acordo com os princípios e objectivos da acção externa da União, deve contribuir, nomeadamente, para o desenvolvimento sustentável, a erradicação da pobreza e a protecção dos direitos humanos.
A Ucrânia não está sózinha nesta matéria, mas deve demonstrar a sua incondicional determinação em introduzir reformas mais abrangentes e mais inclusivas se pretende aproximar-se da UE. Iremos continuar a dar um apoio significativo à Ucrânia nos seus esforços para introduzir reformas internas.
A União Europeia assumiu como objectivo tornar-se o líder mundial no sector dos sistemas mundiais de navegação por satélite (GNSS) com os programas EGNOS (Serviço Europeu Complementar de Navegação Geoestacionário) e Galileu, garantindo assim a sua independência tecnológica em relação ao GPS norte-americano.
A União Europeia carece de novas sinergias e de uma abordagem integrada entre as diferentes políticas sectoriais, a fim de se alcançar o melhor resultado para o crescimento e o desenvolvimento no terreno. É necessário um maior empenho em prol de uma política regional cada vez mais flexível e integrada com outros instrumentos e programas.
A União Europeia congratula-se, em especial, com a moratória sobre a pena de morte anunciada pelo Presidente da Mongólia, que enfrentou a oposição de alguns sectores a nível interno.
A União Europeia deu o importante passo de introduzir, por meio da sua decisão política baseada no Regulamento (CE) n.º 683/2008, um sistema mundial de navegação por satélite (GNSS) europeu autónomo, por si detido e gerido. A Comissão deve realizar uma análise exaustiva destinada a assegurar uma descrição mais precisa dos cenários de evolução possíveis e das modalidades de operação e utilização após 2013.
A União Europeia deve desempenhar um papel activo no desenvolvimento da ONU para que aquela instituição possa contribuir efectivamente para soluções globais, para a paz e a segurança, para a democracia e para uma ordem internacional baseada no Estado de direito. É necessário apoiar o multilateralismo enquanto interesse estratégico prioritário da UE, bem como reforçar a coesão e a visibilidade da UE como actor mundial no âmbito da ONU. A transformação da ordem internacional que está em curso desafia a UE a empenhar-se mais activamente num diálogo com potências mundiais estabelecidas e emergentes e com outros parceiros bilaterais e multilaterais, a fim de promover soluções eficazes para problemas que afectam tanto os cidadãos da UE como os cidadãos dos restantes países do mundo.
A União Europeia e o Canadá têm boas e sólidas relações comerciais há muitos anos. O Canadá é mesmo um dos mais antigos parceiros comerciais da UE. Em meados da década de 1970, a UE assinou o primeiro acordo económico e comercial com o Canadá. Ouros acordos se seguiram no sector pecuário e associados a vinhos e bebidas espirituosas. O Acordo Abrangente em matéria de Economia e Comércio UE-Canadá (AAEC) poderia ser muito vantajoso para ambos os parceiros comerciais.
A União Europeia e os seus Estados-Membros têm a oportunidade de se tornarem pioneiros no transporte verde com a introdução de incentivos aos utentes de meios de transporte sustentáveis e incentivando a transição para uma União sem carbono.
A União Europeia enfrenta muitos desafios com os quais os seus concorrentes não se confrontam necessariamente, embora consiga manter-se na competição. Refiro-me à inexistência natural de fontes de energia em solo europeu, que constitui decididamente um obstáculo para o desenvolvimento e a inovação. Refiro-me também ao envelhecimento da população europeia, que é outro desafio enfrentado pela União Europeia.
A União Europeia já tem experiência com os testes de esforço empreendidos pelo Comité de Supervisores Bancários Europeus (CEBS). Essa experiência data de Maio de 2009, quando o Conselho ECOFIN mandatou o CEBS para organizar testes de esforço ao sistema financeiro, em cooperação com a Comissão Europeia e o Banco Central Europeu. O objectivo consistia em dispor de um nível de informação agregada sobre a capacidade de resistência ao esforço do sistema financeiro europeu no seu conjunto, e os testes concentraram-se nos 22 grupos bancários de maior dimensão. Os resultados não foram divulgados porque, segundo se dizia na altura, o mercado era muito sensível. A única coisa que foi divulgada foi uma metodologia para contemplar três cenários - o melhor, o intermédio e o pior -, e a finalidade dos testes não era a transparência do mercado.
A União Europeia mostra-se ávida e impaciente por adquirir todos os aparatos e atributos de um Estado.
A União Europeia possui a maior economia do mundo e, no entanto, está a ficar para trás de outros actores internacionais em matéria de estratégia digital e de economia digital. A Europa tem de tomar iniciativas relativamente à banda larga e à utilização da Internet, a fim de assumir a liderança no desenvolvimento desta área. A banda larga sem fios é essencial se quisermos garantir que todos os cidadãos tenham acesso a serviços novos e inovadores.
A União Europeia só poderá competir com os seus concorrentes a nível mundial se a política de coesão puder utilizar plenamente o potencial de desenvolvimento não exclusivamente das regiões urbanas, mas também das zonas rurais, com o seu potencial endógeno, e se conseguir dar uma resposta suficientemente flexível aos desafios e às dificuldades identificadas pela estratégia "Europa 2020".
A União Europeia tem a oportunidade e a responsabilidade de alimentar o novo Estado e de garantir o estabelecimento da democracia, do Estado de direito e do respeito pelos direitos humanos no Sudão e no Sudão do Sul.
A União Europeia tem a responsabilidade de transmitir mensagens explícitas sobre a importância da democracia, dos direitos humanos e do respeito do Estado de direito.
A União Europeia tem de continuar a prestar ajuda humanitária à população e ajudar as partes a chegar a um acordo que propicie a constituição de um governo de transição neutro, que seja consensual e inclusivo, a fim de restabelecer a ordem constitucional e convocar eleições democráticas livres e transparentes que permitam a participação livre de todos os movimentos e dirigentes políticos e possibilitem que o povo malgaxe decida sobre o seu futuro.
A União Europeia tomou medidas a este respeito nas áreas da agricultura, adaptação às alterações climáticas, florestação, gestão dos recursos marinhos e zonas costeiras, bem como gestão da água.
A União Europeia é a maior economia do mundo. A necessidade de um mercado interno único é crucial para que a Europa assuma a liderança na economia global, com ênfase no sector dos serviços e na economia do conhecimento. A Agenda Digital e a economia digital podem servir como ponta-de-lança para tornar o mercado interno uma realidade para todos os sectores da nossa economia.
A União Europeia é hoje um verdadeiro actor no palco mundial. O seu papel nas organizações internacionais multilaterais é visivelmente crescente e tem-se revelado cada vez mais importante.
A União Europeia é uma experiência feita de experiências: a zona euro, este próprio Parlamento em que estamos, o espaço Schengen e vários outros instrumentos são experiências. O problema é que os políticos são muitas vezes muito menos humildes do que os cientistas.
A União Europeia, através do seu financiamento da investigação e da inovação, e através do seu apoio à agricultura, bem como ao desenvolvimento regional, contribui de forma tangível para impulsionar as economias europeias.
A União despende actualmente 1 euro por habitante e por ano para defender o princípio fundamental do direito destes cidadãos aos alimentos, dentro de uma lógica de solidariedade europeia. A eliminação deste euro simbólico no altar dos egoísmos nacionais e da austeridade orçamental ilustra o fracasso moral e político da Europa.
A União e os seus Estados-Membros devem, portanto, providenciar incentivos financeiros ou fiscais às empresas e indivíduos, concentrando-se na investigação científica e técnica e no desenvolvimento de áreas que sejam menos lucrativas mas grandemente benéficas para o público.
A União pretende agora dar resposta a uma crise do modelo neoliberal com fórmulas neoliberais e cortes sistemáticos nas despesas, especialmente na segurança social, apesar de se saber que essa despesa constitui uma defesa contra as crises económicas.
A União tem necessidade de uma nova abertura em relação à Rússia, uma vez que, desde a última Cimeira UE-Rússia surgiu um grande número de desafios que não podemos vencer sem melhor cooperação. Hoje, a União Europeia é unânime contra a política russa de reavivar desafios latentes e contra as tentativas de Moscovo de intervir nas políticas de Estados independentes que anteriormente faziam parte da USSR, como é o caso da Geórgia. É com crescente ansiedade que observamos exemplos sucessivos de ataques à liberdade de imprensa e a jornalistas independentes.
A abordagem assumida no relatório aparentemente prejudica os esforços efectuados pelo Governo do Sri Lanka para promover a verdade e a compreensão, sobretudo através da Comissão das Lições Aprendidas e Reconciliação, e do facto de o Governo ter libertado mais de 200 000 prisioneiros tamil.
A abordagem global será um documento de estratégia política, que estabelecerá todos elementos chave da nossa política em relação ao Sudão. Os principais objectivos da UE são ao apoio à paz entre os dois Estados e a democratização e prosperidade em cada um deles.
A acrescentar a este atraso tecnológico, há os efeitos da crise económica, que atingiu duramente este sector, causando uma quebra de 20% a 25% do seu volume de negócios em comparação com 2008.
A actividade de representantes de interesses de diversa ordem junto das instituições comunitárias (aqui, Parlamento Europeu e Comissão) tem inegáveis vantagens, aumentando o leque de informação relevante para o momento decisório e facilitando o conhecimento de interesses legítimos e atendíveis, mas é essencial salvaguardar a transparência da actuação das instituições comunitárias, de modo a garantir, em última instância, a sua própria legitimidade e a cabal prossecução do seu escopo, sem desvio de poder.
A actual Organização Comum de Mercado (OCM) dos produtos da pesca não tem conseguido contribuir suficientemente para a melhoria dos preços na primeira venda e para uma melhor distribuição do valor acrescentado na cadeia de valor do sector.
A actual Organização Comum de Mercado dos produtos da pesca não tem contribuído suficientemente para a melhoria dos preços na primeira venda, nem para uma melhor distribuição do valor acrescentado na cadeia de valor do sector. A situação económica de um grande número de empresas deteriorou-se nos últimos anos, levando ao desaparecimento de muitas delas, sendo real o risco de desaparecimento de milhares de empresas de pesca e de destruição de milhares de postos de trabalho devido ao aumento do preço dos combustíveis.
A actual PAC inclui instrumentos dirigidos às alterações climáticas, principalmente através dos vários benefícios conexos entre políticas agro-ambientais e alterações climáticas. O primeiro pilar dá apoio ao rendimento dos agricultores que têm de respeitar a condicionalidade, um conceito que inclui obrigações de base, algumas das quais são relevantes para as alterações climáticas. A política do desenvolvimento rural no segundo pilar disponibiliza aos Estados-Membros medidas mais direccionadas para as alterações climáticas.
A actual ausência de normas harmonizadas relativas à marcação de origem coloca a União Europeia em desvantagem, priva os produtores europeus de bens de consumo cuja origem é um critério importante da oportunidade de tirarem os benefícios associados à produção na União, e impede os consumidores de terem acesso à informação relativa à origem dos produtos. A marcação de origem facilitaria a escolha do consumidor e contribuiria para reduzir as marcas de origem fraudulentas, imprecisas e enganosas.
A actual conjuntura económica deve ser encarada como uma oportunidade para, com acrescida legitimidade, se reformular o que pode ser mais eficiente, combatendo com tenacidade todo e qualquer desperdício de tempo e recursos. A necessidade de consolidar os orçamentos públicos obriga-nos a ser mais inovadores e a procurar um maior impacto do financiamento disponível. O presente relatório, que votei favoravelmente, faz a reflexão sobre a situação actual e a necessidade de futuras sinergias para uma eficácia reforçada entre fundos. A coordenação destes fundos deve ser melhorada.
A actual crise económica e financeira confere a este FEAG um papel primordial em ordem a atenuar os impactos sociais decorrentes da falência de muitas empresas, muitas vezes provocada pela política económica aguerrida de mercados emergentes, sendo esta a terceira candidatura a ser analisada no âmbito do orçamento da UE para o ano de 2011.
A actual crise económica, financeira e social demonstrou que o modelo de governação económica em vigor na União não funcionou: o quadro de supervisão revelou-se muito frágil e as regras do Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento não foram respeitadas.
A actual dinâmica de venda não permite a repercussão das oscilações dos custos dos factores de produção, incluindo os combustíveis, nos preços do pescado - para o que contribui, entre outros factores, a actual política de importações.
A actual reunião do Conselho Europeu é a última reunião a ter lugar durante a Presidência húngara do Conselho, à qual não foi dado o devido reconhecimento, uma vez que vários projectos concretos constantes da agenda da UE seguida pelos húngaros, incluindo os projectos relacionados com a governação económica, foram ensombrados por questões políticas, como a lei relativa aos meios de comunicação social ou a Constituição húngara.
A actual situação migratória no Mediterrâneo e as pressões resultantes colocaram em evidência algumas debilidades e reacções descoordenadas dos Estados-Membros na gestão de Schengen.
A adesão ao acervo de Schengen envolve a necessidade de cumprir diversos procedimentos de avaliação, devendo os países candidatos cumprir uma série de condições para poderem ser admitidos no espaço de livre circulação, um espaço que actualmente abarca 25 países e 400 milhões de cidadãos. O presente relatório avalia as posições da Bulgária e da Roménia, salientando, por um lado, que a Bulgária segue as melhores práticas em diversas actividades e, por outro lado, os esforços envidados pela Roménia no que respeita às lacunas que foram sendo detectadas.
A adição de uma componente ecológica ao primeiro pilar, em conjugação com uma política de desenvolvimento rural reforçada, é outro objectivo essencial que ajudará a combater as alterações climáticas e os desafios ambientais e contribuirá para a concretização da estratégia "Europa 2020".
A administração de antimicrobianos aos animais tem de ter em conta a potencial ameaça da resistência antimicrobiana nos seres humanos, frequentemente causada por doses inadequadas de medicamentos antibióticos, tratamentos incorrectos e pela exposição constante de organismos patogénicos aos antimicrobianos nos hospitais.
A adopção da proposta do senhor deputado Zahradil reabriu o debate sobre a importância da marcação de origem de produtos de países terceiros, como uma medida destinada a implementar uma política comercial que pode prevenir perturbações do mercado, devidas a um aumento das importações estrangeiras e a resolver o complicado enquadramento legislativo que dificulta actualmente o desenvolvimento das pequenas e médias empresas.
A adopção deste relatório é um importante passo em frente, pois lança as bases para a implantação geral dos sistemas globais de navegação por satélite e, especificamente, para o desenvolvimento do EGNOS, que deveria facilitar o caminho para a implementação do sistema Galileo.
A adopção do Tratado de Lisboa tem reforçado os poderes do Parlamento, e este é hoje co-legislador em quase todas as áreas no âmbito do procedimento legislativo ordinário. À luz desses desenvolvimentos, neste contexto constitucional, e de acordo com seu compromisso para com a transparência, o Parlamento e a Comissão concordaram em estabelecer e manter um registo comum. A fim de ter em conta as alterações aos direitos e obrigações existentes e a criação de novos direitos e obrigações dos deputados, a resolução aprovada hoje defende a necessidade de alterar o Regimento do PE.
A adopção, em Junho do ano passado, de uma nova estratégia da UE, a "Europa 2020”, visa ajudar-nos a sair da crise económica e contribuir para o desenvolvimento da União Europeia. É também um passo significativo em termos da manutenção e mesmo do aumento da mobilidade juvenil.
A afectação de mais dinheiro a este sector com o objectivo de compensar o aumento dos preços do petróleo constituirá um maior incentivo para que os pescadores continuem a utilizar navios de alto consumo, em especial num contexto em que o aumento dos preços dos combustíveis deixaram de ser conjunturais e passaram a ser nitidamente estruturais.
A afirmação da União Europeia no contexto internacional só se consegue por via de uma acção concertada dos Estados-Membros e dos órgãos da União. Neste contexto, uma Política Comum de Segurança e Defesa capaz de responder aos desafios que se lhe colocam ergue-se como um objectivo de primeiro grau.
A agricultura dá segurança ao aprovisionamento de alimentos a preços acessíveis e de qualidade, dá uma protecção indispensável ao ambiente e à ocupação equilibrada do território, cria empregos, crescimento e riqueza.
A agricultura é, sem dúvida, o sector económico em que a União Europeia tem conseguido mais resultados. O presente debate antecipa o anúncio de propostas cruciais de reforma pela Comissão previsto para Outubro.
A ajuda da União Europeia ao Sul do Sudão deve ser compatível com o que o novo Estado pode efectivamente absorver.
A aliança da UE com a NATO e os EUA para levarem a cabo a guerra e a agressão em países como a Líbia aí estão a demonstrá-lo. São princípios fundamentais da Carta da ONU, como a não ingerência nos assuntos internos dos Estados, o respeito pela sua soberania e independência e o reconhecimento do seu direito ao desenvolvimento, que a UE tem vindo a colocar em causa. A soberania reside no povo. E os povos da Europa não a conferiram a esta UE, cada vez mais anti-social e antidemocrática.
A alta taxa de desemprego jovem é uma das prioridades da Comissão e é uma das minhas principais preocupações pessoais. A falta de emprego gerará possivelmente um êxodo de jovens da Europa, mas a esmagadora maioria dos jovens que mudarem de país para procurar trabalho escolherão outro Estado-Membro.
A alteração agora proposta ao Regimento do Parlamento visa o estabelecimento e manutenção de um registo comum de inscrição e controlo das organizações e das pessoas que, de alguma forma, participam na elaboração e na implementação das políticas da União Europeia.
A alteração apresentada ao Regimento vem dar resposta à corrupção revelada nos últimos meses, em que três eurodeputados aceitaram uma proposta corrupta de jornalistas de investigação. É impossível aceitar que os eurodeputados não sejam sujeitos a escrutínio público relativamente aos interesses que defendem no desempenho do seu papel, à pressão a que estão sujeitos ou a quem os está a pressionar.
A aposta na educação e na formação para atingir uma maior qualificação dos jovens europeus é um objectivo fundamental da Estratégia UE 2020 e um instrumento que considero essencial para combater o desemprego e incentivar o empreendedorismo. É por isso de saudar a iniciativa Juventude em Movimento, em especial na sua vertente de apoio e incentivo à mobilidade dos estudantes e de reconhecimento de qualificações, bem como na importância que é dada à formação não-formal e informal, tantas vezes tão ou mais importante do que as aprendizagens formais.
A aprendizagem desde os primeiros anos de vida deve assentar na garantia de uma rede pré-escolar pública, gratuita e de qualidade, acessível a todos, como algo essencial para o desenvolvimento social e para a luta contra a pobreza. A educação não pode estar à mercê da lógica mercantilista. Há que desenvolver uma rede pública de creches que contemple uma maior vastidão geográfica e uma maior abertura a modelos de ensino que sejam um incentivo ao desenvolvimento da criança e da sociedade, que combata a segregação social e as discriminações, de modo a perspectivar uma vida e um futuro melhores.
A aprendizagem desde os primeiros anos de vida deve assentar na garantia de uma rede pré-escolar pública, gratuita e de qualidade, acessível a todos, como algo essencial para o desenvolvimento social e para a luta contra a pobreza. A educação não pode estar à mercê da lógica mercantilista. Há que desenvolver uma rede pública de creches, infantários e jardins infantis que contemple uma maior vastidão geográfica e uma maior abertura a modelos de ensino, que seja um incentivo ao desenvolvimento da criança e da sociedade, que combata a segregação social e as discriminações, de modo a perspectivar uma vida e um futuro melhores.
A aprendizagem durante a primeira infância segue tradições distintas, de longa data, nos diferentes Estados-Membros da UE. Afigura-se importante definir um quadro europeu de valores e de metas comuns, podendo estas ser estabelecidas como objectivo em todos os Estados-Membros, pondo a tónica no intercâmbio de boas práticas como factor chave para a prestação de um serviço de elevada qualidade, e colocando os interesses e as necessidades da criança no centro de todos os esforços. As recomendações do relatório centram-se no equilíbrio entre o papel dos Estados-Membros e o papel da Comissão; na necessidade de alargar o âmbito dos serviços para a primeira infância, inspirando-se nas boas práticas de Estados-Membros onde as creches e os jardins-de-infância são um direito dos pais; na inclusão de todas as crianças, qualquer que seja o seu meio social ("noção de serviço público”); na necessidade de dar atenção à situação dos filhos de migrantes e à sua integração no sistema educativo pré-escolar; na inclusão das artes e de todos os recursos susceptíveis de estimular a criatividade das crianças na aprendizagem; na formação dos educadores com vista a melhorar as suas competências interculturais; na promoção de uma maior paridade entre os géneros no sector dos CEPI; e na criação de emprego com elevada qualificação na área.
A aprendizagem durante a primeira infância é extremamente importante para o bom desenvolvimento da criança e é fundamental para a criação de uma sociedade estável e economicamente dinâmica. O investimento na aprendizagem durante a primeira infância traz benefícios a longo prazo para o futuro das nossas crianças. Os esforços de análise do tema tanto numa perspectiva europeia como numa perspectiva nacional feitos no relatório são importantes.
A aprendizagem durante os primeiros anos de vida tem uma importância decisiva para as perspectivas de vida futuras de um indivíduo. O desenvolvimento de hábitos de vida saudáveis, como a prática de uma boa alimentação e de exercício regular, é um factor determinante para a saúde física e mental ao longo da vida.
A aprovação da Convenção da OIT, complementada por uma recomendação sobre os trabalhadores domésticos, constitui um avanço importante, que valorizamos.
A aprovação de uma Convenção da OIT sobre trabalhadores domésticos constituiria uma primeira medida no sentido de colmatar a lacuna existente, ao garantir direitos associados à sua contratação, a aumentos salariais, à adopção de critérios pelos empregadores ou até ao esclarecer que os empregados domésticos não têm necessariamente de residir em casa do empregador.
A aprovação do Tratado de Lisboa aumentou os casos em que a aprovação do Parlamento é necessária para a conclusão de acordos internacionais.
A aprovação do pacote da governação económica prova, uma vez mais, que o projecto europeu continua vivo e que é a partir da concertação a 27 que os EstadosMembros irão ultrapassar as dificuldades, e simultaneamente, fazer face aos desafios do futuro. A crise soberana das dívidas públicas demonstra que os actuais mecanismos de supervisão e correcção não são suficientes.
A aprovação do relatório por uma ampla maioria traduz o profundo interesse do Parlamento no êxito do presente programa e dos programas subsequentes.
A arte da política estrutural consistirá agora em dar às regiões os impulsos que lhe permitam inovar para enfrentar esses desafios e em ajudá-las no sentido da auto-suficiência.
A austeridade institucionalizada não pode ser a única resposta que oferecemos aos europeus. O pacote "governação" que acabou de ser votado é intrinsecamente desequilibrado na forma como procura responder à crise. É verdade que é necessário reforçar o Pacto de Estabilidade e que os défices devem ser mais bem controlados, e mesmo penalizados.
A avaliação da execução dos programas da política de coesão co-financiados pelos Fundos Estruturais no período de 2007-2013 deve reflectir o impacto dos projectos seleccionados, no âmbito da política de coesão, na recuperação da economia europeia, nomeadamente em termos de criação de novos postos de trabalho, de redução das disparidades socioeconómicas, de reforço da inclusão social e de melhoria do capital humano.
A avaliação do Sétimo Programa-Quadro da União Europeia de actividades em matéria de investigação, desenvolvimento tecnológico e demonstração deve realizar-se olhando para o estado actual da União Europeia, mas com os olhos postos no futuro.
A boa execução da estratégia "Europa 2020" é essencial para que a UE reinicie um crescimento económico sustentado e sustentável.
A capacidade de fazer frente ao tipo e variedade dos problemas previstos depende das condições naturais da região (zonas montanhosas, por exemplo, encontram-se expostas a problemas diferentes daqueles a que estão expostas as zonas de fraca elevação), da sensibilidade fisiológica da vegetação da floresta, de até que ponto ecossistemas individuais desenvolveram a sua capacidade de adaptação, da intensidade da alteração climática prevista (na Europa Central e na Europa Oriental, por exemplo, prevê-se que a alteração seja vez e meia superior à média global) e das possibilidades técnicas de que dispõe a silvicultura para tomar providências em matéria de adaptação, por exemplo, mudando a combinação das espécies em favor de árvores resistentes.
A celebração de acordos globais sobre transportes aéreos com países vizinhos ou importantes parceiros mundiais reveste-se de uma especial importância em termos de acesso ao mercado e de convergência regulamentar, promovendo condições de concorrência equitativas, o mesmo nível de normas sociais e ambientais, etc., o que traz benefícios para todas as partes: passageiros, operadores de transporte de mercadorias e companhias aéreas.
A celebração de um novo Protocolo ao Acordo de Parceria no sector da pesca entre a Comunidade Europeia e a República das Seicheles é importante para a economia e para o desenvolvimento da frota de pesca europeia. O novo Protocolo está em conformidade com os objectivos do Acordo de Parceria no sector da pesca, que visam reforçar a cooperação entre a UE e as Seicheles, e promover um quadro de parceria que contribua para o desenvolvimento de uma política das pescas sustentável e para a exploração responsável dos recursos haliêuticos na zona de pesca daquele arquipélago, no interesse de ambas as partes. O novo Protocolo prevê uma contrapartida financeira durante um período de 3 anos, bem como uma autorização anual de pesca nas águas das Seicheles para 48 atuneiros cercadores e 12 palangreiros.
A chegada de fluxos de imigrantes a Lampedusa, nos últimos dias, mostra que a crise migratória é um tema actual e que exige acções imediatas.
A cimeira foi cuidadosamente preparada pelo Serviço de Acção Externa em estreita cooperação com a Comissão e com os dois Presidentes, os preparativos basearam-se nos debates realizados no final de 2010 e em Janeiro de 2011 no Conselho Europeu e no Conselho sobre a Rússia enquanto parceiro estratégico, nos resultados da anterior Cimeira UE-Rússia e na visita realizada em Fevereiro pelo Governo russo à Comissão.
A ciência não existe como um fim em si. Deverá trazer benefícios para a economia e a sociedade. A articulação entre programas específicos precisa de ser reforçada por forma a garantir uma maior coerência na realização e demonstração de projectos científicos, de testes de marketing e projectos de aplicação comercial.
A classe operária não deve nada a quem os privou do que ganhou com o seu suor.
A cláusula de revisão - e agradeço, uma vez mais, ao Conselho por ter salientado a sua importância e declarado a sua disponibilidade para trabalhar desde já com a Comissão para transpor o regulamento - prevê que a Comissão apresente um relatório, seguido, eventualmente, de uma proposta legislativa, até 30 de Setembro de 2013. É minha firme intenção procurar reduzir esse tempo e, para isso, já dei instruções aos meus serviços para que comecem a trabalhar sobre esta questão.
A codificação da legislação já existente resulta na aproximação das legislações dos Estados-Membros respeitantes ao estabelecimento de regras técnicas para o nível sonoro admissível e o dispositivo de escape dos veículos a motor, que propiciem a sustentabilidade ambiental a nível europeu.
A codificação das regras já em vigor para as menções ou marcas que permitem identificar o lote ao qual pertence um género alimentício é o objectivo desta proposta. É, no entanto, de considerar a importância cada vez maior de que exista uma informação correcta e completa para os consumidores, especialmente no respeitante aos lotes, às datas de fabrico e às restantes informações que permitem acompanhar o percurso do produto desde a sua origem.
A codificação dos textos jurídicos comunitários é um procedimento essencial para simplificar e facilitar a compreensão dos mesmos pelos cidadãos europeus e, assim, assistir a uma concreta aplicação das directivas europeias.
A coesão económica, social e territorial é um princípio fundamental na definição de todas as políticas e actividades da UE. Partilho da opinião do relator de que a crise económica nos obrigará a ser mais inovadores e a procurar um maior impacto do financiamento disponível. A inovação significa a criação de sinergias e uma abordagem integrada entre as diferentes políticas sectoriais, a fim de se alcançar o melhor resultado para o crescimento e o desenvolvimento no terreno.
A coesão entre os diferentes territórios da União Europeia é um objectivo fundamental e estratégico de que depende o próprio futuro da Europa.
A combinação da eficácia económica, social e ecológica porá termo ao modelo de comércio livre ultra-liberal que está a destruir as explorações agrícolas familiares. A União Europeia tem de diligenciar para que sejam introduzidas alterações radicais na Organização Mundial do Comércio e de trabalhar mais estreitamente com a Organização das Nações Unidas para a Alimentação e a Agricultura (FAO) para regressar a sistemas de cooperação que incluam direitos aduaneiros variáveis nas fronteiras.
A comissão responsável recomenda (unanimemente) o levantamento da imunidade parlamentar, porque o Tribunal Distrital Central de Buda, Budapeste, pede ao Parlamento Europeu que levante a imunidade do seu membro, Ágnes Hankiss, a propósito de um novo processo penal ordenado pela decisão do Supremo Tribunal da República da Hungria proferida a 12 de Novembro de 2009. Ágnes Hankiss foi acusada por um queixoso particular de um alegado crime de difamação da honra cometido em público (Secção 179 do Código Penal húngaro) e, em especial, de difamação da memória de uma pessoa falecida, o pai do queixoso, nos termos da Secção 181 do Código Penal húngaro, em resultado de uma declaração feita durante o programa "Péntek 8 mondatvadász" em 23 de Janeiro de 2004.
A comissão teve a oportunidade de dar seguimento a muitas destas sugestões construtivas e duradouras; rejeitou-as. Não fizeram nada do que foi proposto, e o relatório deve ser rejeitado por esta Assembleia.
A comunicação da Comissão "O PIB e mais além - Medir o progresso num mundo em mudança" incide sobre o desenvolvimento de indicadores mais inclusivos para complementar o PIB, que proporcionem uma base de conhecimentos mais fiável. O PIB assumiu a função de indicador para medir o desenvolvimento e o progresso global da sociedade, mas não oferece uma base fiável para o debate político de todos os problemas.
A comunicação da Comissão Europeia intitulada "Educação e acolhimento na primeira infância" (EAPI) é uma iniciativa de saudar porque examina os problemas na educação das crianças e visa criar meios para lhes proporcionar o melhor começo possível para o mundo de amanhã. Contudo, em minha opinião, falta neste documento da Comissão uma análise da investigação e dos dados relativos à educação, ao acolhimento e à protecção social das crianças, tendo em conta as informações dos 27 Estados-Membros da União Europeia.
A comunicação da Comissão foi debatida na reunião informal dos ministros responsáveis pela competitividade, em Gödöllő, na Hungria, no dia 13 de Abril de 2011.
A concluir a minha intervenção no que toca à iniciativa Juventude em Movimento, gostaria de agradecer mais uma vez o apoio do relator e das senhoras e senhores deputados.
A concluir, fico muito satisfeita com o entusiasmo do Parlamento - e em particular da minha cara amiga Doris Pack - relativamente às capitais europeias da cultura e com o interesse de Sarajevo na designação. Naturalmente, a Comissão partilha a vossa perspectiva da importância histórica e cultural de Sarajevo. A cidade simboliza alguns dos episódios mais negros da história recente da Europa, mas também é depositária da nossa esperança num futuro melhor.
A concluir, no que respeita ao relatório sobre as dimensões culturais das acções externas da UE, quero salientar a importância da cultura nas nossas políticas de cooperação. É essencial melhorar o entendimento mútuo com países terceiros e, num período de grande agitação política a Sul das nossas fronteiras, parece-me que faz muito sentido encontrarmos resposta para as questões em causa.
A concluir, é indispensável examinar formas de sujeitar as ANC à responsabilidade civil pelas suas notações. Portanto, solicito à Comissão que identifique formas através das quais as agências de notação possam ser responsabilizadas civilmente nos termos do direito cível dos Estados-Membros.
A conclusão deste dossiê fracassou apesar dos vários avanços positivos realizados sobre a questão da clonagem, durante os últimos meses e horas de negociações. A Comissão continua empenhada em dar seguimento ao relatório de Outubro de 2010, o qual, permitam-me lembrar, propunha o seguinte: uma suspensão temporária, por cinco anos, da utilização da técnica de clonagem na UE, da importação e utilização de clones para produção de alimentos, e de alimentos provenientes de clones, em conjugação com a introdução de sistemas de rastreabilidade para as importações de sémen e embriões de clones.
A condição prévia para iniciar negociações e reforçar as relações comerciais continua a ser a obrigação, por parte do Japão, de eliminar as barreiras não pautais e os entraves que impedem o acesso aos contratos públicos japoneses.
A confiança não pode ser decretada, tem de ser merecida e conquistada. Nós apenas podemos tentar melhorar a confiança entre os Estados-Membros, através de uma governação mais vigorosa do espaço Schengen, garantindo que o avaliamos, não através do sistema de revisão pelos pares de que dispomos hoje, mas através de um mecanismo independente de base comunitária, com o envolvimento da União Europeia, a fim de identificar problemas ou deficiências do sistema de Schengen numa fase muito inicial e também garantir que temos à nossa disposição instrumentos destinados a ajudar de imediato os Estados-Membros em dificuldades.
A consciência dos consumidores relativamente aos produtos que compram está constantemente a crescer.
A conservação das florestas é crucial para o interesse de toda a humanidade. É pena que, uma vez mais, ela sirva de pretexto para promover o mercado do carbono. O capitalismo verde europeu é um beco sem saída. O capitalismo e a ecologia são incompatíveis.
A construção de alicerces sólidos nos primeiros anos da vida de uma criança ao nível da educação e do acolhimento, em complemento com o papel central da família, constitui o fundamento essencial para o êxito em matéria de aprendizagem ao longo da vida, integração social, desenvolvimento pessoal e empregabilidade futura.
A construção do sucesso educativo é o ponto central deste relatório e é também o motivo pelo qual votámos a seu favor. É uma questão de mais mobilidade para os jovens, de maior capacidade para desenvolver oportunidades de trabalho e de um mercado de trabalho que deve ter em consideração não apenas os jovens que trabalham num determinado contexto, mas todos os sectores que proporcionam oportunidades de crescimento aos jovens.
A cooperação Schengen teve início em 14 de Junho de 1985 com a assinatura do Acordo de Schengen, permitindo a supressão dos controlos sistemáticos nas fronteiras internas dos países signatários e a criação de um espaço comum, em que as pessoas circulam livremente.
A cooperação entre o Tribunal de Contas e a Comissão do Controlo Orçamental, da qual sou membro, é excelente, e permitiu a formulação de um conjunto de recomendações sobre a maneira como o Parlamento Europeu deverá votar ao conceder a quitação. No entanto, na avaliação das instituições individuais, especialmente das agências europeias, detectam-se constantemente deficiências, por exemplo, no processo de recrutamento, nos contratos públicos, em problemas com transparência ou problemas com o controlo interno.
A cooperação europeia no domínio do ensino e da formação profissionais para apoiar a Estratégia "Europa 2020" é fundamental.
A cooperação institucional deve ser justa, lógica e democrática.
A cooperação neste domínio facilitará o estabelecimento do diálogo com sociedades de diferentes culturas.
A cooperação para o desenvolvimento constitui a única política de acção externa que defende os sectores mais marginalizados e vulneráveis da sociedade. A Comissão tem de envidar todos os esforços para assegurar a dotação de fundos suficientes para o desenvolvimento do sector privado nacional e de pequenas e médias empresas nos países de baixo rendimento. A migração tem de ser objecto de especial atenção. Importa garantir que o dinheiro destinado ao combate à imigração ilegal seja utilizado para o fim a que foi destinado.
A cooperação territorial irá também ser fundamental para o cumprimento dos objectivos da estratégia Europa 2020. É precisamente por isso que considero que ela tem de estar bastante mais acessível aos potenciais parceiros do sector privado, que necessitam de uma verdadeira oportunidade para passarem a ser parceiros de pleno direito nos projectos de cooperação territorial.
A cooperação transfronteiras europeia faz actualmente parte da política de coesão. Por um lado, contribui para a criação de projectos supranacionais e estratégias da UE e, por outro, contribui para reduzir barreiras entre territórios e regiões. Estou convencido de que a cooperação territorial eficaz é importante não apenas dentro da União, mas principalmente em áreas que partilham uma fronteira com Estados-Membros da União Europeia.
A coordenação das políticas económicas dos Estados-Membros, tal como estabelecido no Tratado sobre o Funcionamento da União Europeia (TFUE), implica a observância dos seguintes princípios orientadores: preços estáveis, finanças públicas e condições monetárias sólidas e balança de pagamentos sustentável.
A coordenação e linhas de informação e comunicação claras continuam a ser o aspecto crucial da nossa capacidade para sermos eficazes nestas situações. Temos lições a aprender nesta frente.
A credibilidade que a Europa necessita é a do "poder suave", da influência, que contribui para o estabelecimento da democracia, que abre um gabinete para apoiar o desenvolvimento da sociedade civil e que não define a cooperação internacional com a União Europeia em termos de subjugar os outros aos interesses diplomáticos e económicos unilaterais da União, mas que incentiva as políticas baseadas numa parceria equitativa entre diferentes regiões do mundo.
A criação de "regiões intermédias”, como propõe o relatório, significa que zonas relativamente ricas de Estados-Membros mais pobres receberão apoio e poderão preparar-se gradualmente para o momento em que irão perder totalmente este financiamento adicional. A possibilidade de criar um grupo de regiões desse tipo é uma evolução muito bem-vinda para os principais beneficiários da política de coesão, que têm de fazer planos a longo prazo. A adopção desta proposta pelo Parlamento no dia de hoje enviaria uma mensagem muito importante no debate sobre a futura forma da política de coesão.
A criação de um registo comum em matéria de transparência e a melhoria de todas as regras relativas à transparência no Parlamento Europeu são passos necessários com vista a aumentar a confiança dos cidadãos nas actividades do Parlamento e assegurar a transparência necessária destas actividades.
A criação de um verdadeiro "Erasmus para aprendizes” foi o compromisso que assumi na campanha eleitoral europeia de 2009: trata-se de dar aos jovens e aos menos jovens a oportunidade de viajarem pela Europa e terem um contacto directo com as realidades económicas do mercado interno, ao mesmo tempo que se iniciam no mundo do trabalho ou adquirem experiência profissional.
A criação do espaço Schengen data de 1985 e contempla, actualmente, um território com 42 673 km de fronteiras marítimas externas e 7 721 km de fronteiras terrestres, abrangendo 400 milhões de cidadãos. Actualmente o acordo Schengen engloba 25 Estados-Membros com um espaço comum de livre circulação de pessoas, através da supressão dos controlos sistemáticos nas fronteiras internas e a criação de uma fronteira externa única.
A criminalidade, e o crime organizado em particular, nunca foram detidos por fronteiras ou controlos de fronteira.
A crise económica conduziu muitos países da área do euro a graves problemas de dívida e é evidente que as regras do Pacto de Estabilidade não protegeram a União Monetária dos resultados da gestão irresponsável e de grande amadorismo por parte dos governos de alguns países.
A crise económica e financeira expôs e aumentou a necessidade de coordenação e melhoria da supervisão das políticas económicas na União Económica e Monetária (UEM). Estas experiências recentes revelaram também lacunas e deficiências no actual sistema de coordenação e nos procedimentos existentes de supervisão. A crise inverteu drasticamente as condições favoráveis em que actuava o sector económico e financeiro até 2007, tendo a maioria dos Estados-Membros de passar por um processo de consolidação das suas contas para reduzir a dívida pública.
A crise económica e financeira teve como consequência uma queda acentuada da procura de veículos comerciais e de passageiros na Europa que, por sua vez, resultou numa redução significativa da produção de veículos a motor.
A crise económica mundial instalada, agravada pela crise política do Magrebe e Médio Oriente, conduziu de novo a um aumento do preço dos combustíveis, cifrando-se o preço do barril acima dos 100 dólares.
A crise financeira dos últimos anos realçou que existem três problemas fundamentais no sector: falta de concorrência, excesso de confiança nas notações externas no quadro regulamentar e ausência de responsabilidade pelas notações das ANC.
A crise financeira e económica projectou uma luz crítica sobre as agências de notação de crédito e, em particular, sobre o seu papel activo no prolongamento da crise, e os principais problemas identificados são a falta de concorrência, a dependência excessiva das agências de notação externas e a falta de responsabilização no sector.
A crise financeira iniciada com a falência do banco Lehmann Brothers em 2008 e o crédito subprime (titularização abusiva da dívida hipotecária) veio lançar dúvidas muito sérias quanto à solidez das instituições financeiras, obrigando os governos, quer europeus quer dos Estados Unidos, a injectar fundos públicos (cerca de 25 % do PIB) no sector financeiro.
A crise financeira realçou a existência de três problemas essenciais no sector: falta de concorrência, excesso de confiança nas notações externas no quadro regulamentar e ausência de responsabilidade pelas notações das ANC.
A crise multiforme que enfrentamos exige uma nova racionalidade económica, social, energética e ambiental e a defesa do direito de cada país a produzir, de forma sustentável - algo que o livre comércio, um dos pilares do neoliberalismo, claramente inviabiliza.
A crise pode proporcionar-nos uma oportunidade para mudarmos as nossas regras e instituições, ou para criarmos outras novas. O economista Joseph Schumpeter falava da "destruição criativa". Neste momento, a UE dispõe, pois, de uma oportunidade única para criar um novo mecanismo capaz de, a longo prazo, conduzir a uma maior estabilidade macroeconómica, orçamental e monetária para os EstadosMembros e de os ajudar a aumentar a sua competitividade. A experiência que adquirimos no passado com o funcionamento da União Económica e Monetária mostrou que essas regras têm de ficar consagradas na legislação, e que não podemos contar com a boa vontade de cada Estado-Membro.
A cultura desempenha um papel importantíssimo no contexto da União Europeia, um espaço que se quer unido na diversidade. A montante, salienta-se a sua inegável dimensão integradora, propiciando a existência de lugares comuns, isto é, pontos em que pessoas oriundas de diferentes horizontes culturais se encontram numa representação comum. Não por acaso, a exposição de motivos do relatório inicia com uma curiosa citação: Culturalmente falando, o rock-and-roll foi um elemento decisivo para a abertura das sociedades comunistas e para as aproximar mais de um mundo de liberdade (Andras Simonyi). Salientam-se, por outro lado, os inegáveis reflexos económicos que podem advir da aposta na divulgação da cultura europeia.
A cultura, como todos os fenómenos históricos, não é feita de uma qualquer identidade homogénea e comum.
A decisão de admitir a Roménia e a Bulgária no espaço Schengen continua a ser puramente política. O relatório que apoia a inclusão da Roménia neste espaço, adoptado pelo Parlamento Europeu, apenas serve para confirmar que as opiniões dos peritos da União estão correctas - a Roménia fez um bom trabalho, tornou as suas fronteiras seguras e cumpriu todas as condições exigidas. A opinião do Parlamento tem, em Bruxelas, carácter consultivo e agora, como no passado, a decisão está nas mãos dos políticos do Conselho. A aplicação de dois pesos e duas medidas e o discurso sobre critérios obrigatórios que, uma vez cumpridos, são encarados como "meramente técnicos” não são, de todo, característicos da União democrática e justa que conhecemos. É por isso que apenas posso esperar que as opiniões dos peritos e do poder legislativo europeu não continuem a ser ignoradas pelos políticos dos Estados-Membros.
A decisão de aumentar os recursos do novo quadro financeiro plurianual em 5 % garantirá a estabilidade dos ciclos de programação existentes e novos investimentos em domínios como as redes europeias de energia e de transporte, o que permitirá à Europa defender a sua competitividade e abrir caminho ao crescimento económico a longo prazo.
A decisão define o processo de atribuição da designação Capital Europeia da Cultura, e as regras não deixam margem de manobra para o Conselho designar uma cidade de um país terceiro. A Comissão é a única responsável pela execução das decisões aprovadas pelo Parlamento e pelo Conselho.
A decisão sobre o chamado registo de transparência não é suficientemente ambiciosa. O registo da Comissão, que está agora a ser combinado com o registo do Parlamento, é voluntário e abrange uma pequena parte dos cerca de 15 000 representantes dos grupos de pressão em Bruxelas. O registo não contém informações relevantes.
A definição de uma estratégia europeia de protecção das florestas faz parte do compromisso geral da UE de combate às alterações climáticas.
A definição e a disponibilização de indicadores e de estatísticas descritivas que permitam monitorizar a evolução de factores económicos e ambientais e, bem assim, possíveis interacções entre ambos, constitui indiscutivelmente uma ferramenta útil de apoio ao planeamento estratégico, à definição de políticas públicas e ao delinear de vias de desenvolvimento sustentáveis.
A delegação ao Parlamento Europeu do Partido Liberal Democrata alemão presume que a inclusão da Roménia e da Bulgária no espaço Schengen irá reforçar a livre circulação na UE. Agora que estes dois Estados-Membros obtiveram resultados de avaliação positivos em todos os domínios da avaliação Schengen, não devem surgir mais obstáculos que protelem a sua inclusão. É inegável que a segurança das fronteiras a nível técnico não as tornará automaticamente seguras enquanto persistirem problemas no combate à corrupção no sistema judicial e policial.
A delegação do Partido Liberal Democrata alemão no Parlamento Europeu admite que a inclusão da Roménia e da Bulgária no espaço Schengen irá melhorar a liberdade de circulação na UE. Agora que ambos os Estados-Membros alcançaram resultados positivos na avaliação de todos os domínios abrangidos pela revisão de Schengen, não devem existir obstáculos adicionais que atrasem mais a sua inclusão. É impossível negar que a protecção técnica das fronteiras não as tornará seguras enquanto continuar a haver problemas com o combate à corrupção e com o sistema judicial e policial.

A delegação socialista espanhola votou a favor do relatório Merkies sobre a União da Inovação: transformar a Europa para um mundo pós-crise, porque concordamos e estamos empenhados nos princípios fundamentais que o relatório apresenta e que define as bases para a transição para uma economia europeia inteligente, sustentável e equitativa.
A derrogação, caso seja concedida, constitui as preferências máximas que a UE pode conceder ao Paquistão nesses termos e, por conseguinte, o regulamento terá de reflectir o conteúdo da derrogação da OMC logo que o mesmo esteja negociado.
A despeito dos direitos aduaneiros baixos, creio que é bastante claro que o volume das transacções comerciais bilaterais entre a UE e o Japão está aquém do volume das transacções comerciais entre a UE e outros parceiros comerciais importantes.
A dimensão do desenvolvimento rural também é relevante para os países que aderiram recentemente à UE. Infelizmente, o número de trabalhadores que migraram tem sido mais elevado nas zonas rurais.
A dimensão externa da União Europeia tem de ser reforçada, porquanto o artigo 21.º do Tratado da União Europeia promove um sistema internacional baseado numa cooperação multilateral mais forte, em que os Estados-Membros conferem à União a capacidade de afirmar os seus interesses e valores na cena internacional.
A dimensão externa da política social destina-se a promover as normas sociais fundamentais em países terceiros tendo em vista o cumprimento dos Objectivos de Desenvolvimento do Milénio fixados pelas Nações Unidas e a protecção dos trabalhadores decorrente do respeito das normas laborais internacionais. A UE está longe de se dar por vencida e deve, por isso, aproveitar a sua credibilidade e a sua "boa reputação” nesta matéria para estabelecer alianças sociais com os seus principais parceiros comerciais e promovê-las ao nível da Organização Mundial do Comércio (OMC) e da Organização Internacional do Trabalho (OIT). Devemos exigir aos países terceiros que, antes de se sentarem à mesma mesa de negociação com a UE, subscrevam as mesmas normas laborais fundamentais de âmbito internacional.
A dimensão externa da política social destina-se a promover normas laborais e sociais em países terceiros e a combater o dumping social, que frequentemente resulta da globalização ou do comércio internacional. A União não pode continuar sem reagir ao dumping no que respeita ao bem-estar, à saúde e ao ambiente, porque ele é responsável por demasiadas deslocalizações da produção para fora da Europa.
A dimensão externa da política social inclui actividades e iniciativas da UE destinadas a promover normas laborais e sociais em países terceiros.
A dimensão externa da política social inclui actividades e iniciativas da UE destinadas a promover normas laborais e sociais em países terceiros. A UE assumiu o duplo objectivo de se tornar um pólo de excelência em matéria de responsabilidade social das empresas (RSE) e de promover essa responsabilidade nas suas políticas externas. O desrespeito de normas sociais fundamentais de âmbito internacional constitui uma forma de dumping social e ambiental que prejudica as empresas e os trabalhadores europeus.
A dimensão externa da política social inclui actividades e iniciativas da UE destinadas a promover normas laborais e sociais em países terceiros. A protecção dos direitos económicos e sociais constitui um dever para todos os Estados-Membros, que decorre da Declaração Universal dos Direitos do Homem das Nações Unidas.
A dimensão externa da política social inclui actividades e iniciativas da UE destinadas a promover normas laborais e sociais em países terceiros. O desrespeito de normas sociais fundamentais de âmbito internacional, que ocorre tanto no interior como no exterior da União, constitui uma forma de dumping social e ambiental que prejudica quer as empresas europeias, quer os trabalhadores e os cidadãos da UE e de países terceiros.
A dimensão externa da política social é uma das principais prioridades do Grupo da Aliança Progressista dos Socialistas e Democratas no Parlamento Europeu. É essencial reforçar as normas laborais internacionais, nomadamente as respeitantes à liberdade de associação e de negociação colectiva, à eliminação do trabalho forçado e obrigatório e da discriminação no emprego e nas profissões, e à abolição do trabalho infantil.
A dimensão externa da política social é uma prioridade fundamental tanto para o nosso grupo como para mim próprio.
A diplomacia cultural tem um importante papel a desempenhar na consolidação de relações frutuosas com países terceiros e, em muitos países, podemos tirar partido da Rede Europeia de Institutos Culturais Nacionais (EUNIC). Muitas pessoas que se ligaram a essa rede estão prontas para colaborar.
A directiva em questão aplica-se às emissões dos tractores agrícolas e o seu objectivo é uma alteração quantitativa da Directiva 2000/25/CE. A directiva em apreço diz respeito às emissões dos tractores agrícolas e propõe uma alteração meramente quantitativa à Directiva 2000/25/CE. Esta directiva é urgente pelo facto de incidir num período que já teve início no dia 1 de Janeiro de 2011 e, aspecto muito importante, pelas repercussões positivas que se espera venha a ter no sector em questão. A presente directiva estabelece o nível máximo de emissões para cada tipo de tractor, em função da potência do motor utilizado, e organiza a redução progressiva das emissões em etapas sucessivas.
A directiva em questão era uma excelente oportunidade para procurar criar normas comuns aos 27 Estados-Membros, assim como para simplificar a legislação comunitária em matéria de direitos dos consumidores, que se encontra ainda fragmentada em diversos actos legislativos.
A directiva em questão respeita às emissões dos tractores agrícolas e prevê uma alteração quantitativa sem alterar os objectivos ambientais previamente definidos na Directiva 2000/25/CE. Face às dificuldades presentemente sentidas no sector, um aumento da percentagem do número de motores introduzidos no mercado ao abrigo do regime de flexibilidade poderá ser vantajoso.
A directiva era um projecto europeu ambicioso e, naquela altura, a Comissão receava que a proposta completa fosse sabotada e que a directiva não chegasse em absoluto a concretizar-se caso insistisse no alargamento da directiva para além da relação entre empresas fraudulentas e cidadãos. À luz dos exemplos específicos que aqui evocaram e dos casos de abuso descobertos pela Comissão, poderá ser possível alargar o âmbito de aplicação da directiva para além da relação entre empresas fraudulentas e cidadãos aquando da revisão prevista para o próximo ano.
A directiva estabelece um conjunto de requisitos relativos a estatísticas contabilísticas, a previsões e a processos orçamentais. Não podemos esquecer que a inadequação da planificação orçamental e a falta de rigor da informação financeira contribuíram para agravar esta crise.
A directiva que aqui foi aprovada hoje pela grande maioria do Parlamento Europeu assinala uma fase importante da consecução de uma maior protecção dos consumidores na União Europeia.
A directiva relativa aos direitos dos consumidores vai permitir a harmonização plena dos direitos dos consumidores europeus.
A disponibilidade do Japão para iniciar conversações bilaterais sobre uma zona de comércio livre com a União Europeia constitui para nós uma oportunidade para aprofundarmos as relações políticas e aumentarmos as vantagens económicas, tanto para a UE como para o Japão. Considerando que o Japão é apenas o sexto maior parceiro comercial da União Europeia, o potencial de cooperação entre o Japão e a UE no domínio do comércio e do investimento continua ainda por explorar. O principal obstáculo que dificulta o acesso das empresas europeias ao mercado japonês são as barreiras não pautais.
A distribuição dos recursos da PAC entre os agricultores da União Europeia, que está no topo da agenda do diálogo público, exige cuidado. A ideia de uma taxa fixa em toda a União Europeia é alvo de uma oposição alargada.
A diversidade de tradições pedagógicas, incluindo ao nível da educação pré-escolar, que existe no seio da União, é aceitável e positiva, pois essas tradições reflectem os aspectos culturais, históricos e sociais únicos dos diferentes países europeus.
A divulgação da metodologia antes da publicação dos resultados do teste de esforço irá reforçar a credibilidade geral do exercício.
A droga é hoje um dos maiores flagelos que a nossa sociedade enfrenta. É uma problemática social e culturalmente complexa e dinâmica, que não pára de se modificar, apresentando novos contornos, a utilização de novas substâncias e novos grupos de consumidores. O Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência (OEDT), criado em 1993, tem como principais tarefas a recolha de dados sobre a droga e a toxicodependência, a elaboração e publicação de informações objectivas, fiáveis e comparáveis a nível europeu.
A economia da Irlanda do Norte é uma economia de pequenas e médias empresas - 97% de todas as empresas podem ser classificadas dessa maneira - mas é uma economia que está aquém de outras regiões do Reino Unido e da Europa na utilização das verbas do programa-quadro. A burocracia é referida como a principal dificuldade, e muitas pequenas empresas estão simplesmente mais preocupadas em manter a porta aberta do que com os benefícios a longo prazo do programa de investigação e inovação.
A economia de certos EstadosMembros, incluindo a do meu país, a Polónia, está já a sofrer as consequências do Pacote Clima-Energia, imposto arbitrariamente e utilizado como instrumento de concretização do objectivo político 20-20-20. No entanto, este objectivo político é, também, frequentemente mal interpretado: fala-se de uma redução de 20% no consumo energético, quando o verdadeiro objectivo é um aumento de 20% da eficiência energética, o que não é o mesmo. O termo "eficiência” é frequentemente utilizado de forma incorrecta na documentação da UE, devido a uma compreensão errónea da expressão "eficiência energética” e dos métodos da sua avaliação. Por outras palavras, cumpre saber se se trata da eficiência nacional bruta, ou da eficiência per capita, ou ainda da eficiência de conversão, por exemplo, da conversão de energia primária em trabalho útil.
A economia mundial, incluindo a Europa, vive a pior crise desde a Grande Depressão, e nós tivemos de retirar as conclusões necessárias.
A educação é, sem dúvida, um processo complexo e a longo prazo, cuja qualidade e, sobretudo, resultados influenciam duradouramente as futuras carreiras dos jovens. Não o esqueçamos.
A educação, a formação profissional e o conceito universal de "aprendizagem ao longo da vida” são os elementos fundamentais do futuro da integração europeia, que se vê confrontada com desafios constantes em relação ao apoio à Estratégia "Europa 2020”. Temos de enfrentar o facto de o desemprego dos jovens estar a aumentar a um ritmo alarmante.
A eficácia deste instrumento ainda não foi demonstrada, e a modulação dos fluxos de transporte cria problemas ao planeamento financeiro, actual e futuro, porque a tarifação varia e muda a toda a hora. A este respeito, disseram-me que os Estados Membros são livres de aplicar, ou não, esta majoração, porém, quando se trata de transporte transfronteiriço, depende também das decisões dos outros, pelo que terá de se chegar a acordo.
A eliminação ilegal de resíduos classificados como perigosos tornou-se um dos negócios mais lucrativos que existe.
A eliminação sustentável de certas substâncias é um objectivo que exige uma monitorização permanente e o aparecimento gradual de soluções tecnológicas a longo prazo. É por esta razão que concordo com a relatora quanto à necessidade de nos concentrarmos na reversibilidade, na esperança de que a investigação conduza em breve à transmutação definitiva do combustível irradiado e dos resíduos radioactivos, de modo a que estes possam ser utilizados para outros fins.
A energia nuclear é um tema controverso, que suscita debates vigorosos no Parlamento e entre os nossos grupos.
A enorme dependência do modo de transporte rodoviário é um problema real (em Portugal, a dependência deste tipo de transporte é ainda superior à média da UE). Seja por razões de ordem ambiental e de saúde pública, devido aos elevados níveis de poluição que lhe estão associados, seja também por razões de natureza energética, que se prendem com a escassez progressiva do petróleo e com a dificuldade acrescida de acesso a esta matéria-prima. É essencial por isso promover uma diversificação dos modos de transporte de mercadorias, particularmente com uma aposta forte no transporte ferroviário.
A entrada da Síria no Conselho dos Direitos do Homem seria um insulto às vítimas e às respectivas famílias, e um incentivo ao regime sírio para fazer uso da força bruta contra o seu próprio povo, totalmente ao arrepio dos valores que o Conselho dos Direitos do Homem deve defender.
A entrada em vigor do Tratado de Lisboa aumentou os casos em que a aprovação do Parlamento era necessária para a conclusão de acordos internacionais.
A entrada em vigor do Tratado de Lisboa trouxe a implementação do Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa (SEAE), que deverá na sua acção englobar uma estratégia coordenada e coerente no que diz respeito à diplomacia cultural.
A escolha do caminho acertado no domínio do direito dos contratos poderá constituir uma contribuição significativa para melhorar o funcionamento do mercado interno e abrir às empresas todo o seu potencial, em especial às PME, bem como aos consumidores.
A estabilidade da zona euro, em particular, e da Europa, no seu todo, obrigam à reestruturação dos instrumentos de prevenção e supervisão para, assim, corrigir os desequilíbrios macroeconómicos. A consolidação financeira é fundamental para corrigir os erros do passado e permitir às economias europeias um crescimento sustentado e não alavancado numa dívida pública e externa, mas sim na promoção do emprego e da competitividade.
A este propósito, apraz-me verfificar que, no âmbito da votação sobre o Livro Verde intitulado "Preparar as florestas para as alterações climáticas", foi aprovado o n.º 38 do relatório Arsenis, que "insta a Comissão a apresentar uma proposta legislativa para a prevenção de incêndios florestais" e prevê, nomeadamente, "a proibição, durante 30 anos, de construir em terrenos onde tenha havido um incêndio florestal". Esta é uma boa forma de contrariar a prática generalizada de usar os incêndios florestais para promover os interesses dos promotores imobiliários.
A este propósito, o Primeiro-Ministro Orbán declarou recentemente que cumpre diferenciar claramente entre migrantes económicos e refugiados políticos. A Europa deve acolher os últimos se quiser ser fiel aos seus princípios. A Europa, por meio de um mecanismo semelhante a um Plano Marshall, deve ajudar os países do Norte de África de forma a criar condições de habitabilidade naquela região, combatendo assim uma das causas primordiais da migração. Para tal, será necessário não só um acordo entre todos nós, como também consultas aos nossos vizinhos e, em especial, em parceria com os países do Norte de África, sendo ainda necessário ter em conta uma grande diversidade de factores, como a protecção internacional, a migração, a mobilidade e a segurança.
A este propósito, quero referir que se mantêm níveis elevados de pobreza nos países, territórios e regiões em desenvolvimento e que convém aumentar as verbas dedicadas às causas da pobreza - em particular a subnutrição, os problemas de saúde, a educação e o acesso à água potável - e não avançar para sistemas que regulam a imigração no âmbito de outros regimes financeiros.
A este respeito, estou cada vez mais preocupado com a questão das exclusões. Compreendo perfeitamente que a Índia exija certas exclusões em certos sectores das negociações. Um país com o nível de desenvolvimento que a Índia hoje apresenta precisa de exclusões. Trata-se de uma questão que, certamente, nós, na Europa, bem podemos entender.
A este respeito, gostaria de salientar que a implementação do primeiro dividendo digital nos Estados-Membros tem progredido até agora a velocidades muito diferentes.
A este respeito, é importante garantir que o primeiro programa europeu para a política do espectro radioeléctrico esteja em linha com os objectivos já delineados na estratégia Europa 2020 e na Agenda Digital e que se insira nas acções prioritárias do Acto para o Mercado Único.
A estratégia "Europa 2020" visa aumentar o nível de participação no ensino superior para 40 % e reduzir a taxa de abandono escolar precoce para 10 %. Para que estes objectivos sejam alcançados, todos os Estados-Membros têm de partilhar estas metas.
A estratégia da União Europeia 2020 é consensual, as suas prioridades são claras e os objectivos mensuráveis.
A estratégia europeia para a energia e clima deve combinar a competitividade da economia com a segurança do abastecimento de energia e as preocupações ambientais.
A estratégia europeia para um crescimento sustentável e inclusivo permanece no topo das suas preocupações e não pode deixar de estar presente na preparação do orçamento comunitário para o exercício de 2012. O papel reservado às pequenas e médias empresas é extremamente relevante, uma vez que são quem melhor permitirá alavancar semelhante tipo de crescimento.
A evolução da situação mundial relativamente à produção, tráfico e consumo de drogas ilícitas é preocupante. O relatório de 2009 do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência confirma desenvolvimentos de sentido negativo, em relação a drogas como a cocaína, a heroína e novas drogas sintéticas, em que se regista a persistência de consumos elevados e mesmo a tendência do seu agravamento.
A evolução do nosso modelo de desenvolvimento, concentrada doravante na economia de conhecimento, torna a cultura um sector de importância estratégica.
A execução dos planos de reforma da Grécia exige um esforço extraordinário do povo grego. A Comissão propõe agora uma resposta excepcional como um sinal de que há esperança para os gregos.
A existência de adidos culturais da UE significaria apenas mais tachos principescamente remunerados para funcionários públicos privilegiados, a pagar pelos países contribuintes.
A existência de um Direito Europeu dos Contratos, longamente debatida nas Instituições, pode representar uma série de benefícios para as empresas, para os consumidores e para o próprio funcionamento do mercado interno. Não somos indiferentes, por isso, às potencialidades ligadas à existência de um acervo comum de normas e princípios gerais aplicáveis ao direito dos contratos, a nível do aumento das transacções transfronteiriças, da regulação do comércio electrónico e do melhor acesso dos consumidores aos produtos.
A existência de um registo das organizações e trabalhadores que participem na tomada de decisões e na execução de políticas da UE reforça, assim, a transparência do diálogo entre estes representantes da sociedade civil e as instituições comunitárias, ao mesmo tempo que consagra medidas vinculativas em caso de incumprimento do Código de Conduta anexo ao Acordo.
A existência de uma aceitação recíproca dos resultados da certificação, ao mesmo tempo que se garantem procedimentos de certificação de produtos mais rápidos, mais simples e menos onerosos, trará enormes vantagens em termos económicos quer para as empresas europeias, quer canadianas.
A experiência resultante da implementação de programas da política de coesão ilustra claramente que o resultado positivo da maioria das acções de desenvolvimento regional depende basicamente da implementação de iniciativas complementares.
A exportação de resíduos controlados da UE com vista à deposição é proibida nos termos da legislação em vigor, estimando-se, todavia, que a transferência ilegal de resíduos da UE rondará 22 000 toneladas anuais. A Directiva REEE refere que os equipamentos electrónicos exportados devem estar em condições de funcionamento.
A factura energética representa, para o sector da pesca, a maior parcela dos custos de operação, e, ao contrário de outras actividades, o sector não pode contrariar o agravamento deste custo com um aumento da produção, em virtude do tecto de capturas estabelecido pelos TAC e quotas.
A família natural é o espaço ideal para a criança crescer e se desenvolver, e, volto a insistir, a concessão de licenças de maternidade ou de paternidade suficientemente longas pode ajudar a reduzir a procura de estruturas de acolhimento para a primeira infância.
A fase de trílogos foi longa e trabalhosa e o acordo, infelizmente não total, a que chegámos, fica a dever-se à Presidência húngara, na pessoa de András Kármán, à Comissão, na pessoa do Comissário Olli Rehn, e a todos os nossos colaboradores.
A favor. 2011 é o momento estratégico de colher os ensinamentos de quatro anos de vigência do Regulamento (CE) n.º 1905/2006, que institui um instrumento de financiamento da cooperação para o desenvolvimento (ICD). A Comissão anunciou que apresentará as suas propostas relativas ao quadro financeiro plurianual (QFP) para o pós-2013 antes do período de interrupção de Verão dos trabalhos do Parlamento, e as propostas legislativas referentes aos instrumentos financeiros de acção externa em data posterior, ainda no corrente ano. O presente relatório visa definir uma primeira posição do Parlamento acerca do novo instrumento de financiamento destinado a reger a cooperação para o desenvolvimento da UE, com base nas lições extraídas no decurso da implementação do ICD.
A fim de alcançar os resultados propostos, é necessário manter os principais critérios para a afectação dos fundos de acordo com o nível de desenvolvimento e de convergência entre as regiões da UE. Apoio este relatório porque entendo que complementar o quadro financeiro plurianual após 2013 é uma solução viável, que envolve fazer alterações na estrutura actual.
A fim de assegurar que esta Eurovinheta não seja um mero imposto, mas ajude efectivamente a melhorar os transportes na Europa, os Estados-Membros são igualmente incentivados a reinvestir as receitas arrecadadas em benefício da modernização dos modos de transporte. O Parlamento também conseguiu assegurar a realização de verdadeiros progressos no que respeita à interoperabilidade dos sistemas de portagem, bem como a concessão de incentivos à utilização de veículos pesados de mercadorias menos poluentes.
A fim de demonstrar a pertinência do acordo, a resolução defende que as economias indiana e europeia são complementares.
A fim de eliminar os potenciais obstáculos ao funcionamento adequado do mercado interno causados por práticas ou disposições divergentes dos Estados-Membros, e a fim de acompanhar o ritmo do desenvolvimento do comércio electrónico e dos futuros desafios no mercado dos produtos têxteis, é necessário examinar a harmonização e a normalização de outros aspectos da etiquetagem dos têxteis, com vista a facilitar a livre circulação dos produtos têxteis no mercado interno e de atingir um nível alto e uniforme de protecção do consumidor em toda a União Europeia.
A fim de estimular as economias dos países dos Balcãs Ocidentais, foi-lhes concedido um acesso privilegiado ao mercado europeu.
A fim de impedir que os consumidores comprem inadvertidamente produtos fabricados com matérias derivadas de animais (peles e curtumes), apoiei este relatório, que prevê que as etiquetas contenham obrigatoriamente a frase "partes não têxteis de origem animal". A etiqueta será igualmente uma protecção contra certos problemas que possam afectar alguns consumidores que sofram de alergias.
A fim de reflectir melhor e mais aprofundadamente os requisitos do Tratado nos procedimentos nacionais dos EstadosMembros, estamos prestes a adoptar regras que irão melhorar a qualidade dos quadros orçamentais nacionais.
A fim de simplificar esse critério de proporcionalidade, a Comissão irá apresentar um manual alterado como orientação para a aplicação do critério de proporcionalidade. A formação, que se encontra no topo da agenda para as próximas semanas, meses e anos, será extremamente importante porque temos de formar juízes, magistrados do Ministério Público e advogados na aplicação das nossas regras europeias.
A fim de tratar deste problema e de o resolver, a Senhora Comissária Reding projecta emitir uma comunicação até ao fim do ano, que relatará qual o estado da execução da directiva já existente relativa à publicidade enganosa e comparativa e quais as oportunidades actuais de a rever, e fornecerá uma avaliação da situação. A Senhora Comissária está a ponderar melhorar o conteúdo da directiva e a analisar as conclusões a retirar das práticas enganosas.
A finalidade destas medidas consiste em ajudar países do processo de estabilização, como os países dos Balcãs Ocidentais, através de medidas comerciais preferenciais com a União Europeia relativamente a países terceiros.
A finalidade deste relatório relativo à instituição de um instrumento de financiamento da cooperação para o desenvolvimento é definir, numa fase inicial, uma posição do Parlamento nesta matéria.
A formulação sobre o agravamento da situação dos direitos humanos e o maior número de incidentes deveria ser precedida da palavra "recentemente”, visto que não se trata de acontecimentos gerais que se agravaram ao longo dos anos.
A frase utilizada na proposta de resolução é potencialmente ofensiva para os indianos.
A futura agenda de cooperação transfronteiras, transnacional e inter-regional assume uma importância estratégica na definição dos objectivos de cada realidade territorial na Europa, e no modo como estes podem ser realizados. A "cooperação territorial" é um valor acrescentado que permite explorar todas as potencialidades de uma região, aumentando a sua competitividade.
A futura política de coesão tem de ter um orçamento adequado, para poder ir eficazmente ao encontro dos novos desafios, para apoiar todas as regiões da União Europeia, com particular ênfase, como sempre, para as regiões com maiores problemas de desenvolvimento, para incluir objectivos temáticos e, ao mesmo tempo, um nível de flexibilidade, para se basear em normas simplificadas que tenham sido o mais possível unificadas entre os seus fundos e para garantir que todos os cidadãos da União possam usufruir dos seus benefícios, mesmo que vivam nas zonas mais remotas da União Europeia, em ilhas e em regiões montanhosas.
A futura política de coesão, pilar da solidariedade do projecto europeu e da justiça social, deve ter em conta as seguintes prioridades: em primeiro lugar, reforçar a coesão social e integrar os desafios colocados pela estratégia "Europa 2020"; em segundo lugar, ter em consideração as necessidades e especificidades geográficas das regiões, em especial as das regiões mais desfavorecidas; em terceiro lugar, manter uma abordagem gradual da recolha de fundos, para que as regiões não abandonem o objectivo da convergência, evitando mudanças bruscas na recepção da assistência; e, em quarto lugar, promover um sistema equitativo.
A futura reforma da política comum das pescas terá de procurar o apoio dos pescadores.
A gestão sustentável dos resíduos radioactivos e do combustível irradiado tem de incluir o ciclo de vida dos resíduos (desde a geração até à armazenagem temporária ou final, bem como durante o período pós-encerramento das instalações de armazenagem) e a reabilitação do ambiente.
A globalização da economia e a deslocalização das empresas europeias trouxe preocupações na dimensão externa da política social.
A governação económica e a política económica nacional devem ser consideradas em maior grau como uma questão de interesse comum de todas as partes envolvidas.
A governação para a inovação deve implicar o estabelecimento de novas parcerias facilitadoras de sistemas de inovação eficientes que mobilizem as capacidades intelectuais e empreendedoras, detectando também os inovadores adormecidos - e temos muitos na Europa - através de um ambiente empresarial favorável à inovação, sobretudo para as PME, que abranja todos os sectores da economia.
A grande contradição deste relatório é que valoriza bastante as cidades, mas esquece os cidadãos. Coloca-se bastante ênfase no reforço da Agenda Urbana da UE, no desenvolvimento de infra-estruturas físicas de base e no seu contributo para o tecido económico, na sustentabilidade energética e ambiental, através de investimentos baseados no progresso tecnológico, mas secundarizam-se as pessoas.
A grande maioria dos indivíduos que se entregaram no Reino Unido era, na verdade, e conforme se verificou, composta por migrantes de outros Estados da União Europeia, acusados de crimes habitualmente graves, não de pequenas infracções. É irónico o facto de o Partido da Independência do Reino Unido (UKIP), que começou por se opor ao direito de estes migrantes entrarem no Reino Unido, estar agora a tornar extremamente difícil e oneroso para o contribuinte britânico o repatriamento desses migrantes para os seus países para que respondam perante a justiça.
A grande questão que se coloca, tanto à Comissão como a este Parlamento, é a de saber se devemos insistir em que o Japão continue a fazer progressos na redução destes obstáculos não tarifários antes de encetarmos as negociações, ou iniciar as negociações na esperança de que, ao fazê-lo, incentivaremos o Japão a reduzir as suas barreiras não pautais. Não é fácil a resposta a esta questão.
A grande superfície florestal presente na Europa é criadora de um considerável volume de negócios e número de postos de trabalho dentro da União. Tendo isto em conta, e não esquecendo a importância destes espaços verdes a nível ambiental, considero capital a tomada de medidas para combater os efeitos negativos das alterações climáticas que se têm verificado nos últimos tempos a nível global, a fim de salvaguardar as florestas europeias e todas as externalidades positivas com estas relacionadas.
A grande variedade de aspectos das relações culturais com países terceiros originou uma fragmentação das políticas, que agora exige uma estratégia mais coordenada e coerente da UE. Optámos por destacar os quadros organizativo e político que são necessários para optimizar a coordenação da cultura nas acções externas da UE. O preenchimento do conteúdo não deve ser regido nem regulado excessivamente do topo para a base.
A grave situação económica e social em diversos EstadosMembros da União Europeia devia merecer deste próximo Conselho, de Junho, uma atenção muito especial, uma reflexão profunda sobre as suas causas, a assunção de responsabilidades pela políticas comunitárias cada vez mais neo-liberais, como privatizações e desvalorização do trabalho, que estão a provocar mais desigualdades sociais, maiores divergências económicas, mais desemprego, pobreza e exclusão social.
A história oficial do Governo cubano é que a sua morte foi causada por pancreatite. Não obstante, de acordo com dissidentes que vivem em Cuba, a morte de Juan Soto foi causada por uma grande sova administrada pela polícia do regime comunista de Castro.
A ideia de que o QFP deve apoiar a governação económica, num momento em que a UE já percebeu que são necessários uma maior coordenação das políticas económicas e um maior controlo das políticas orçamentais, parece-me uma ideia muitíssimo pertinente.
A ideia subjacente à presente resolução é a de que a Política Comum de Segurança e Defesa, após a entrada em vigor do Tratado de Lisboa, prevê a intenção política firme da União de agir como uma força de estabilidade no mundo e dispõe de um quadro jurídico claro para o reforço das suas capacidades de perseguir os seus objectivos.
A igualdade de acesso aos mercados do sector público na UE e a revisão do quadro jurídico dos contratos públicos são essenciais para promover o Mercado Único na União e nos Estados-Membros e, consequentemente, a integração social e económica da UE. Atendendo ao contexto de crise económica e financeira, considero que a estratégia proposta nesta resolução é uma necessidade, em particular no que se refere ao objectivo de conferir uma maior coerência à política de comércio externo comum europeia.
A igualdade de circunstâncias em termos de desenvolvimento contribui significativamente para reforçar o mercado comum, o que produz resultados positivos para todos os Estados-Membros da UE. A política agrícola comum beneficia todos os consumidores da UE. Vale a pena ter em mente que os agricultores têm rendimentos muito reduzidos, apesar do apoio que recebem do orçamento europeu.
A implementação da política de coesão 2007-2013 merece a atenção do Parlamento por diversas razões importantes, que são as seguintes: o crescimento sistemático da coesão é estrategicamente importante para o futuro da União; o Fundo de Coesão é uma oportunidade para os novos Estados-Membros e para regiões sujeitas a condições de desenvolvimento particularmente difíceis; nos últimos anos, foram manifestadas reservas sobre a implementação da política pela Comissão do Controlo Orçamental devido à taxa de erro, que é demasiadamente elevada. O relatório Mikolášik merece ser apoiado.
A importância do sector dos transportes na economia europeia reflecte-se no emprego que directamente possibilita a mais de 10 milhões de pessoas e nos 5 % do PIB que representa. A sua evolução mostra-se essencial para o crescimento económico da UE e para o estreitar das distâncias físicas e psicológicas.
A importância económica, social e ambiental das florestas a nível internacional, europeu, regional e nacional é, de um modo geral, bem conhecida e encontra-se, em certa medida, legitimada em acordos internacionais e programas de cooperação e financiamento relevantes.
A imposição de uma taxa aos veículos pesados de mercadorias pela utilização de certas infra-estruturas, nos termos do documento do Parlamento Europeu levado hoje a votação em plenário, constitui um acréscimo de custos relacionados com a circulação deste tipo de transporte. A Eurovinheta é uma medida que penaliza os países periféricos da União Europeia e constitui, simultaneamente, uma receita adicional nos países da Europa Central, num período em que aqueles países passam por um período de dificuldades económicas e financeiras.
A imposição de uma taxa aos veículos pesados é uma medida que penaliza os países periféricos da União Europeia e constitui, simultaneamente, uma receita adicional nos países da Europa Central. O texto resultante do trílogo é menos negativo para Portugal do que a proposta saída da Comissão dos Transportes e do Turismo (TRAN), pois reduz a taxa de variação para 175 % e o pico horário de taxação para cinco horas, prolongando a isenção dos veículos menos poluentes por mais 1 ano (passa a ser por 4 anos). Porém, a imposição desta taxa continuará a ser uma realidade e trará um acréscimo dos custos existentes para os países periféricos da União Europeia.
A imposição de uma taxa aos veículos pesados é uma medida que penaliza os países periféricos da União Europeia, como a Grécia, a Itália, a Espanha e Portugal, que por sua vez são em grande parte os mais afectados pelo contexto de crise financeira (que se transformou nestes países numa crise orçamental e económica). Atendendo ao acima exposto, voto contra o documento apresentado, pois considero injusta a desigual incidência de tais taxas, uma vez que seria nos países periféricos que obteria a maior parte das receitas, em benefício dos países da Europa Central.
A imunidade parlamentar não serve para cobrir os delitos de direito comum. Ágnes Hankiss pode ser julgada sem que a sua actividade parlamentar seja posta em causa.
A incapacidade de avaliar com exactidão o impacto das directivas apresentadas neste relatório sobre a proposta de regulamento do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho sobre prevenção e correcção dos desequilíbrios macroeconómicos foi o que me decidiu a abster-me da votação. Não há dúvida de que a escala do colapso económico da Grécia, combinado com o risco de uma crise similar atingir muitos outros Estados-Membros, exige urgentemente uma estratégia para impedir que tal desastre volte a acontecer.
A inclusão de novos indicadores e o estabelecimento de limiares inferiores e superiores dos mesmos, que serão simétricos quando necessário, permitirão funcionar como níveis de alerta, para evitar os resgates financeiros actuais, levados a cabo pela Comissão e pelo FMI.
A inclusão pode reforçar a integridade ambiental dos nossos compromissos em matéria de clima, assegurando a cobertura de todas as emissões e eliminação e, ao mesmo tempo, aumentando a visibilidade dos esforços dos agricultores e dos silvicultores para aumentarem sumidouros através de uma gestão sustentável da utilização dos solos.
A independência do Banco Central Europeu (BCE) é incontestável e está consagrada no Tratado - e é, por isso, uma independência legal e fundada no Tratado; mas eu posso atestar também ao senhor deputado que nos cerca de sete anos que levo de exercício destas funções, e em que lidei com muita frequência com o BCE, pude testemunhar muitas situações em que o BCE provou que não precisava do nosso apoio para afirmar a sua independência.
A indústria europeia demonstrou que podemos contar com o seu empenho em procurar soluções inovadoras que ajudarão no combate às alterações climáticas. Só serão possíveis resultados inovadores se houver investimentos bem planeados e de longo prazo.
A indústria florestal europeia é mais sustentável do que qualquer outro sector da economia. Há várias gerações que os proprietários das florestas europeias cumprem a mais rigorosa legislação em matéria de conservação das florestas e da natureza. Não obstante, o relatório apresentado pela Comissão do Ambiente, da Saúde Pública e da Segurança Alimentar sobre o Livro Verde da Comissão sobre a protecção das florestas e a informação florestal introduz uma nova torrente de regulamentação, sem reconhecer a importância das florestas enquanto motores do emprego e da economia. O relatório solicita que se apliquem excessivos critérios de sustentabilidade à gestão florestal na UE, descurando completamente os factores regionais e os poderes de cada país. Os pontos essenciais que excedem a competência da política florestal nacional e fragilizam as florestas em termos económicos são sobretudo as disposições relativas aos fornecimentos de madeira na Europa.
A indústria nuclear, mais do que as outras, deve compreender que a transparência é crucial para todas estas questões de segurança - V. Exa. repetiu seguramente a palavra mais de dez vezes, Senhor Comissário - como o é a independência tanto dos operadores como das autoridades de supervisão estatais, com a nomeação de peritos independentes, e nesta questão continuamos insatisfeitos.
A iniciativa "Juventude em Movimento” incide sobre a mobilidade para fins educativos, mas é igualmente vital assegurar que o ensino que os jovens recebem satisfaça as necessidades do mercado de trabalho e, consequentemente, é essencial dotá-los das competências e do conhecimento de que irão necessitar.
A iniciativa "Juventude em Movimento” é um ponto de referência importante para os jovens cidadãos europeus. É um ponto de referência sobretudo em termos financeiros, pois representa mais um impulso para os projectos europeus relativos à mobilidade dos jovens estudantes e melhora as escolas europeias, estimulando a investigação e o debate sobre o significado de uma Europa unida e demonstrado o que ela pode proporcionar. O contributo da "Juventude em Movimento” para o debate sobre a definição de um modelo cultural europeu não é menos importante. A cooperação entre os vários institutos e a aprendizagem nas várias disciplinas, que são leccionadas de forma diferente nos vários países, dependendo igualmente da consciência política das classes dirigentes, também representam um contributo fundamental para a definição de uma identidade europeia.
A iniciativa "União da Inovação” continua a ser o passo mais importante da União Europeia para o desenvolvimento de uma estratégia europeia integrada em relação à investigação e à inovação. O aumento do ritmo da investigação e da inovação é essencial para a construção de um modelo económico justo e competitivo, garantindo a criação de postos de trabalho, orientando a actividade empresarial para uma gestão sustentável dos recursos, fazendo frente aos desafios energéticos e estimulando a sociedade do conhecimento.
A iniciativa Juventude em Movimento integra-se na Estratégia Europa 2020, apresenta 28 medidas com vista a adequar melhor os sistemas de ensino e de formação às necessidades dos jovens, incentivando-os a tirar partido dos apoios comunitários para estudar ou frequentar um curso de formação noutro país. A presente iniciativa visa aumentar a mobilidade dos jovens, procurando garantir que, em 2020, todos os jovens da União Europeia tenham oportunidade de estudar no estrangeiro.
A iniciativa Juventude em Movimento, umas das 7 iniciativas inseridas na UE 2020, é composta de 28 acções-chave para melhorar a educação e a formação dos jovens, através da mobilidade e da introdução dos jovens no mercado de trabalho.
A iniciativa emblemática "Agenda para novas qualificações e novos empregos" assinala que, devido à crise, a taxa de emprego se encontra abaixo dos 69%, enquanto a taxa de desemprego subiu para 10%; partindo do princípio que o mercado de trabalho irá estabilizar em 2010-2011, para que a taxa de emprego atinja os 75% até 2020, terá de haver um aumento médio da taxa de emprego ligeiramente superior a 1% ao ano.
A iniciativa emblemática "Juventude em Movimento” é uma das sete grandes iniciativas incluídas na Estratégia UE 2020 da Comissão Europeia para um crescimento inteligente, sustentável e inclusivo. O programa concentra-se na mobilidade dos estudantes, mas o seu valor acrescentado reside no facto de também antecipar uma educação que corresponda às necessidades do mercado de trabalho e proporcione as competências e o conhecimento necessários.
A iniciativa emblemática da Estratégia Europa 2020 "Juventude em Movimento” tem o admirável objectivo de melhorar o acesso dos jovens ao mercado de trabalho, com destaque para dois vectores.
A iniciativa europeia de criação dos programas Galileu e EGNOS permitirá à Europa não só estabelecer uma autonomia e independência estratégica face aos outros blocos económicos, mas, acima de tudo, trará melhorias na vida quotidiana dos cidadãos europeus e gerará benefícios directos e indirectos para a economia europeia.
A inovação poderá dar origem ao desenvolvimento e à reinvenção da União Europeia quando a actual crise económica estiver superada.
A inovação traduz-se na atractividade e competitividade dos territórios, e o envolvimento das autoridades locais e regionais torna-se essencial em termos de efectuação de dotações, redução de disparidades e destaque do papel activo que os cidadãos têm de desempenhar.
A inovação é o encontrar de soluções para problemas comuns na Europa, significando um maior enfoque, desenvolvimentos mais rápidos, eficiência (de custos) e mais força criativa. A União da Inovação não deve apenas resolver problemas comuns, mas também fortalecer a força competitiva da Europa, encontrando o caminho para sair da crise económica.
A inovação é para a política europeia o mesmo que a educação é para os jovens: um passaporte para o futuro, um seguro contra todos os riscos para uma sociedade que está a efectuar avanços e a preservar a coesão social.
A instauração do espaço Schengen sem fronteiras internas e a livre circulação dos cidadãos europeus constituem um dos princípios fundamentais da UE e um dos pilares da construção europeia. O restabelecimento dos controlos nas fronteiras internas da UE não poderá resolver o problema da imigração. Trata-se de uma medida que tornará mais difícil a vida dos cidadãos europeus e que reanimará os nacionalismos.
A integração de que tanto se ouve falar não deve, porém, consistir em deixarmos de festejar o Natal, a Páscoa, o dia de São Nicolau e outras datas nas nossas escolas e infantários em nome de uma melhor convivência com os imigrantes muçulmanos, porque isso significaria a perda da nossa identidade cultural.
A intenção não é, claramente, que os nossos motoristas e transportadores paguem pelo impacto do ruído e pelo impacto ambiental se, ao mesmo tempo, não introduzirmos medidas destinadas a resolver os problemas, como o tratamento de estradas e outras medidas de minimização da poluição sonora. É muito importante evitar que estes encargos se transformem simplesmente num novo imposto sobre veículos pesados de mercadorias, como alguns deputados aqui têm apontado.
A introdução das contas económicas do ambiente reveste-se de uma importância fundamental, mas não substitui a criação de indicadores alternativos ao PIB que cobram as várias dimensões ambientais e sociais. A Comissão deveria apresentar propostas, antes do início do novo Quadro Financeiro Plurianual, de modo a poder ser adoptado e utilizado um pacote limitado de indicadores compostos para complementar o PIB na concepção das políticas.
A introdução do governo das sociedades pode aumentar a confiança dos cidadãos na estabilidade do sistema financeiro, mas os mercados estão a reagir mediante a introdução dos seus próprios mecanismos, não devendo deixar-se em pouca conta o papel desempenhado pelas agências de notação. É completamente incompreensível que os cidadãos tenham de "apertar o cinto" para pagarem o pacote de resgate dos bancos, ao mesmo tempo que precisamente os gestores desses bancos que estão a pedir desesperadamente socorro estão a pagar a si próprios bónus no montante de milhões de euros.
A investigação é uma componente essencial do conhecimento mundial e, numa economia globalizada, é um esteio garantido do crescimento e da criação de emprego na União Europeia. O Sétimo Programa-Quadro (PQ7) constitui uma boa oportunidade para a União Europeia desenvolver a sua política de investigação, consolidando simultaneamente o Espaço de Investigação Europeu.
A julgar pelas intervenções anteriores, penso que fazer esta pergunta é, em parte, responder-lhe. A Europa está a ter dificuldade em ser tão bem sucedida quanto poderia ser, e nós conhecemos as principais razões disso, pois já foram aqui referidas: de uma maneira geral, na Europa existe uma divisão entre Norte e Sul em termos de investigação e desenvolvimento; a Europa está também atrasada no que se refere aos fundos que as empresas consagram à investigação e ao desenvolvimento; e, como o nosso relator referiu, os investigadores e as PME têm dificuldade de acesso aos vários programas.
A juventude caracteriza-se pela mobilidade e pelas mudanças de emprego. O desemprego dos jovens é grave quando eles não têm acesso a qualquer tipo de trabalho por serem pouco instruídos ou não possuírem experiência profissional, e os jovens que carecem de uma educação ou experiência profissional adequadas têm sempre dificuldades em lutar por um emprego. É por isso que temos de centrar as nossas energias na disponibilização de uma educação abrangente e de elevada qualidade e, além disso, prestar atenção à perspectiva de género, para que as causas profundas do desemprego dos jovens possam ser eliminadas.
A já referida legislação genérica é muito perigosa.
A legislação europeia tem de proteger os cidadãos europeus. Não podemos permitir que estas empresas se possam deslocar impunemente de um Estado-Membro para outro, e até para fora da UE, aproveitando-se do princípio da livre circulação de pessoas e bens em todo o Espaço Schengen.
A legislação húngara e a Constituição adoptada em Abril estão em consonância com a legislação e os valores fundamentais da União Europeia. A Hungria mantém todas as suas obrigações e compromissos jurídicos internacionais, como se encontra, de facto, enunciado claramente no texto da Constituição e, se não fosse esse o caso, então a Comissão recorreria ao Tribunal de Justiça no Luxemburgo para a questionar através de um processo formal; mas todos sabemos neste Parlamento que tal não sucedeu.
A legislação que neste caso é revogada diz respeito às condições de aceitação das provas de origem de certos produtos têxteis com origem em países terceiros, que estabelecia requisitos específicos através da aplicação de restrições quantitativas. O relator subscreve a opinião da Comissão de que as medidas de política comercial aplicadas pela União no sector dos têxteis podem ser geridas sem que seja imposto o encargo excessivo da apresentação da prova de origem para todas as importações. Em nossa opinião, é do interesse dos consumidores e das empresas assegurar que qualquer encargo imposto aos importadores de mercadorias de países terceiros sirva para controlar e limitar esses bens.
A liberalização e desregulação do comércio mundial causou profunda debilitação do aparelho produtivo das economias mais débeis da UE, como Portugal, conduzidas de acordo com os interesses dos grandes grupos económicos das potências europeias.
A lista de acontecimentos é extensa e todos eles afectam a UE e a Rússia, dois intervenientes mundiais vizinhos com interesses a longo prazo predominantemente semelhantes ou complementares.
A longo prazo, o nosso objectivo é dispormos de um único assento, pelo menos para a área do euro.
A líder da oposição, Yulia Tymoshenko, e outras pessoas de relevo foram vítimas de violações dos seus direitos humanos e impedidas de desenvolverem a sua actividade política graças a uma acção penal com motivações políticas e a um Código Penal antiquado.
A maior democracia do mundo evidencia, hoje em dia, paradoxos e assimetrias que uma História muitas vezes milenar integra aparentemente sem dificuldades de monta.
A maioria das iniciativas de incentivo à inovação tem origem no sector empresarial, tornando-se assim fundamental uma cooperação mais estreita com as universidades e os centros de investigação. Por outro lado, a exploração comercial dos resultados da investigação universitária na UE é inadequada ou demasiado lenta.
A maioria destes acordos tem como objectivo implícito a abertura do mercado e a liberalização do sector, tendo por argumentação a livre concorrência ou evitar as suas distorções, os benefícios que as companhias mais poderosas daí podem retirar e a falsa solução ambiental para a redução das emissões de carbono, de inclusão da aviação no regime de comércio de licenças de emissão.
A maioria do PE manifesta, uma vez mais, as suas já tradicionais posições neoliberais e de ingerência relativamente às relações entre a União Europeia e a Rússia.
A maioria do meu grupo também subscreve este acordo, na medida em que representa os primeiros passos rumo à introdução do princípio do "poluidor-pagador", e fá-lo de forma inteligente.
A maioria dos oradores falou de empregos. É esse o propósito da "União da Inovação". Trata-se do aproveitamento da investigação fundamental de base - que tão bem realizamos na União Europeia - e de a transpormos para o mercado de modo a oferecermos aqui empregos em vez de serem oferecidos no estrangeiro.
A medida é o primeiro passo no domínio dos transportes rodoviários conducente à internalização dos custos externos de todos os modos de transporte.
A melhoria da segurança e da governação do espaço Schengen num momento de pressão acrescida é um meio para esse fim.
A mensagem do Conselho ECOFIN é a de que todos têm de assumir as suas responsabilidades. A minha reacção imediata foi a seguinte: "Muito bem, então enfrentemos verdadeiramente as nossas responsabilidades”. Não com enorme pompa, não para podermos dizer que alcançámos um acordo rapidamente, mas tendo em mente os problemas financeiros da área do euro e da União Europeia e numa tentativa de preparar algumas soluções adequadas.
A mensagem do Parlamento Europeu deve ser clara - os benefícios da cooperação económica com a União Europeia não podem sobrepor-se às expectativas relacionadas com a necessidade de avançar no sentido de normas europeias de respeito dos direitos humanos fundamentais, sobretudo liberdade de expressão e de imprensa, que constituem pilares de democracia e são indispensáveis a qualquer sociedade democrática moderna.
A mensagem foi muito confusa e acarretou consequências significativas, incluindo para os produtores espanhóis, mas não só para eles, pois muitos outros viram-se afectados, como já aqui foi referido diversas vezes.
A mesma coisa em relação ao feto, à protecção do feto, ou por exemplo aos próprios checks and balances da República húngara.
A meu ver, deveríamos por cobro à sede insaciável de centralização por parte de Bruxelas.
A meu ver, isto é uma oportunidade perdida. Não o responsabilizo por isto - isto é algo que não está nas suas mãos -, mas nós teríamos sem dúvida todo o interesse em adoptar uma abordagem muito mais organizada, concertada e profissional.
A migração em massa de pessoas provenientes do Norte de África era previsível há meses, e a França e a Itália deviam ter reagido imediatamente, em conjunto com a Comissão. As suas afirmações e acções actuais, com a polícia de um Estado recusando-se a aceitar os documentos de outro Estado, causam mais do que mera surpresa.
A migração, reconheçamos, é uma questão muito emotiva.
A militarização da UE não serve a nenhum povo. A transformação em curso da UE em pilar europeu da NATO faz parte de um processo de divisão internacional de zonas de influência, com a liderança dos EUA, na procura de garantir uma maior exploração da força de trabalho e o acesso e controlo sobre recursos naturais, cada vez mais escassos, nomeadamente hidrocarbonetos, e o controlo sobre os mercados.
A minha grande preocupação, neste momento, é pôr cobro às hospitalizações: é este o meu objectivo primordial.
A minha opinião pessoal é a de que é importante, neste contexto, transmitirmos uma mensagem clara aos parceiros comerciais da União Europeia. A União deve continuar determinada em complementar a ajuda humanitária de emergência que concedeu generosamente ao Paquistão numa fase inicial com medidas comerciais destinadas a conduzir a economia do Paquistão a uma retoma sustentável.
A minha pergunta é concreta: o que está o senhor a fazer para evitar que o BCE, com o seus dois chapéus, obstrua as medidas difíceis mas necessárias para reestruturar a economia grega?
A minha pergunta é muito simples: passados seis meses, apresentou o meu país algum pedido de activação do Fundo Europeu de Ajustamento à Globalização para apoiar os trabalhadores afectados pela crise financeira? Em caso afirmativo, e se o Senhor Comissário dispuser dessa informação, agradeço que nos diga se o pedido foi ou não aprovado.
A minha preocupação seguinte é a operação de arrumação do local. O novo grande sarcófago de protecção é actualmente assunto de muita discussão. Por que motivo ainda não dispomos de uma análise de risco para o Sarcófago I? Por que motivo não conseguimos compreender o problema que aqui existe? Como é possível um projecto de tal magnitude estar a ser gerido sem uma análise de risco transparente? Pergunto-me também como ainda não temos explicação para o facto de ainda não ter sido possível retirar e armazenar as varas de combustível queimado dos Reactores II e III de Chernobyl, que foram devidamente encerrados? Considero isso um problema grave.
A minha primeira palavra é uma palavra de confiança, pela positiva.
A minha segunda mensagem é sobre a Síria.
A minha segunda observação é que, enquanto deputado ao Parlamento Europeu, fiquei profundamente chocado com a mordaz reprimenda de um conhecedor da situação no Sudão que é observador internacional na tão repetidamente flagelada região de conflito de Abyei, segundo a qual a pressão da Europa sobre o regime assassino e faminto de guerra do Presidente al-Bashir foi "nula e mal coordenada". Na realidade, trata-se de uma reprimenda esmagadora.
A minha solução para este problema é, portanto, a seguinte: coloque-se a ênfase na ajuda directa à reconstrução na sequência das inundações e tomem-se medidas imediatas em vez de se perderem em negociações em Genebra.
A minha terceira observação prende-se com a atitude do FMI durante a crise, quando comparada com a da União Europeia.
A minha terceira questão é: quais são as consequências? Não pretendo afirmar que, em última análise, serão boas ou más para nós. No entanto, gostaria de saber antecipadamente como vão ser avaliadas as consequências sociais e como estão as coisas em termos do ambiente ou do mercado de trabalho. São questões que julgo não terem sido inteiramente clarificadas.
A minha última observação tem a ver com o facto de os deputados do Grupo da Aliança Progressista dos Socialistas e Democratas no Parlamento Europeu terem afirmado que deveríamos aplicar a Estratégia 2020 e não apenas reduzir as despesas.
A mobilidade dos aprendizes também conduz a um melhor reconhecimento de muitas profissões e impede o dumping social, já que existe uma escala progressiva que implica que ao mesmo nível de formação seja atribuída a mesma remuneração.
A mobilidade dos jovens na UE e, em particular, a facilitação dessa mobilidade, é importante para a identidade europeia e para as actividades de cidadania europeia.
A moderna sociedade da informação e a escassez de bandas de frequências tornam essencial o planeamento estratégico e a harmonização da utilização do espectro.
A médio e a longo prazo, a solução será tornar praticamente supérflua a utilização de antibióticos. A primeira medida neste sentido é o investimento em investigação e a partilha de conhecimentos de peritos, a segunda é a transmissão deste conhecimento aos criadores e aos veterinários, e a terceira é a informação dos consumidores.
A natureza atractiva do Sétimo Programa-Quadro para a investigação não foi plenamente demonstrada no sector industrial.
A nação tem de poder decidir o seu futuro e a União Europeia tem de ser envolvida no apoio aos malgaxes de todas as maneiras possíveis.
A necessidade de se fazer uma avaliação exaustiva e pormenorizada das causas da insuficiente realização dos objectivos em matéria de cooperação para o desenvolvimento e das diversas linhas de apoio ao sector das pescas na Mauritânia.
A necessidade de uma PAC adequadamente financiada, que ofereça bens públicos, como o fornecimento de bens alimentares seguros e sustentáveis à UE, que garanta um regime estável de preços da alimentação, tanto à saída da exploração, como nas prateleiras do comércio, e que apoie uma economia rural dinâmica, é mais importante que nunca, nomeadamente à luz do recente aumento dos preços de energia e da instabilidade em certas regiões do globo.
A negociação e a assinatura dos acordos de pesca está de acordo com o objectivo geral da UE de manter e preservar as actividades da sua frota de pesca, incluindo a frota de alto mar, e com o desenvolvimento de relações com países terceiros num espírito de parceria e cooperação, com vista a reforçar a pesca sustentável fora das águas da União tomando em conta os factores ambientais, sociais e económicos.
A negociação e a celebração de Acordos de Parceria no domínio da Pesca (APP) satisfazem o objectivo geral de manutenção e salvaguarda das actividades de pesca da frota da União Europeia (UE), em particular da frota de pesca longínqua, sendo a assinatura deste documento fundamental para a prossecução dos objectivos da política externa da PCP.
A negociação e a celebração de Acordos no domínio da pesca satisfaz o objectivo geral de manutenção e salvaguarda das actividades de pesca da frota da União Europeia.
A nossa actual posição é de facto impressionante porque já temos 104 módulos, que os Estados-Membros registaram junto de nós e temos a sua palavra de que podemos mobilizar e dar assistência de um modo previsível, desde que não necessitem destes módulos para combater as mesmas catástrofes nos seus países.
A nossa comissão defendeu a opinião de que a base jurídica deveria ser o artigo 153.º do Tratado, na medida que o assunto em análise se prende directamente com a saúde que a segurança. Frisámos também a importância de prestar informações e de realizar consultas genuínas junto dos trabalhadores sobre a questão da segurança e das avaliações em matéria de segurança, não apenas dos locais onde se procede à gestão do combustível irradiado e dos resíduos radioactivos mas também no respeitante à forma como estes devem ser transportados, e à necessidade de um regime de inspecção efectivo, com sanções que sejam eficazes, dissuasivas e proporcionadas.
A nossa missão enquanto legisladores não é limitar a natureza jurídica do regulamento com base em especulação ou projecções de mercado, mas antes garantir segurança jurídica e lançar as bases para uma linguagem jurídica comum no domínio do comércio.
A nossa preocupação vai, em primeiro lugar, para as vítimas desta epidemia e os seus dependentes sobrevivos. Tão terrível situação não pode repetir-se; temos de tirar dela as devidas ilações e temos de o fazer rapidamente para, de futuro, conseguirmos detectar mais rapidamente as causas e comunicar de forma mais eficaz e coordenada.
A nova Directiva Eurovinheta, que visa incentivar a aplicação de sistemas de tarificação harmonizados nos Estados-Membros para melhorar a eficiência e o desempenho, em termos ambientais, dos veículos pesados de transporte de mercadorias, acabará por penalizar alguns Estados-Membros periféricos, como a Itália, que são países de partida ou de destino de mercadorias.
A nova constituição húngara entrará em vigor em 1 de Janeiro de 2012 e exigirá a adopção de medidas de execução. Por conseguinte, nesta fase, a Comissão pode apenas fazer uma análise preliminar, uma vez que a interacção entre a constituição e o direito da União, bem como os seus efeitos jurídicos só poderão ser plenamente avaliados quando for possível aferir as medidas legislativas, administrativas e judiciais de execução conexas.
A nova directiva é um acordo equilibrado, que oferece benefícios tais como o direito, reconhecido a nível europeu, de os consumidores mudarem de ideia nas duas semanas seguintes após terem recebido o produto que encomendaram e a obrigação de os responsáveis pelas vendas através da Internet fornecerem os seus contactos e informações completas sobre o valor total da compra.
A nova redacção estabelece, de forma clara e imediatamente compreensível, as condições relativas ao processo de reuniões conjuntas, eliminando assim a necessidade de remissão para outras disposições. Além disso, a redefinição das condições justifica-se face ao fardo administrativo e técnico que tal processo implica.
A não-declaração de cuidados domésticos ou de serviços de limpeza priva estes trabalhadores de um nível de vida digno e, sobretudo, de uma reforma digna.
A obesidade, a diabetes, cancros e vários tipos de doenças do aparelho circulatório constituem uma ameaça real para os cidadãos. Dados estatísticos demonstram que, anualmente, as doenças cardiovasculares são responsáveis por 4,3 milhões de mortes na Europa e mais de 1,7 milhões de pessoas morrem por cancro.
A opção de um bom europeu - um verdadeiro bom europeu - seria criar uma alternativa para ajudar os gregos a reintroduzirem a sua moeda, sendo-lhes então possível desvalorizá-la e renegociar as suas dívidas, porque o rácio dívida/PIB atingiu um ponto sem retorno.
A opção pelo lucro dos grandes grupos económicos, em detrimento da satisfação das necessidades das populações e dos trabalhadores, e mesmo da indústria dos países de economias mais frágeis da UE, não pode ser senão condenada e merecer a nossa viva oposição.
A opção pelo lucro dos grandes grupos económicos, em detrimento da satisfação das necessidades dos trabalhadores e das classes populares e mesmo da indústria dos países de economias mais frágeis da União Europeia, continua a gerar a perda de direitos, desemprego e pobreza e a afectar, igualmente, pequenos e médios agricultores, pescadores e PME, todos eles suas vítimas.
A organização de debates públicos e de consultas junto dos interessados, juntamente com a apresentação de relatórios aos parlamentos nacionais para obter opiniões são outras medidas positivas neste sentido.
A outra questão, na qual estamos claramente a obter reacções, é o facto de muito do tempo de trabalho ser gasto em burocracia. É necessário reduzi-la, para que possam ser definidas prioridades adequadas.
A palavra mais importante em qualquer debate deste tema é a "ponderação". Os antibióticos não são prejudiciais, mas a sua utilização imprudente e desregrada é perigosa. Não se pode condenar os antibióticos, mas devem ser utilizados com ponderação em humanos e animais.
A participação civil e a mobilização da sociedade civil, dos empresários, dos investigadores, dos jovens e dos artistas são fundamentais para uma sociedade solidária auto-determinada.
A partir de agora, a Comissão vai poder atribuir notas boas e más a seu bel-prazer.
A pergunta dirigida à Comissão diz respeito justamente à forma como os Estados-Membros abordam este problema.
A pergunta que lhe faço é a seguinte: no que respeita ao dissidente cubano, Juan Wilfredo Soto García, que foi detido, espancado e por último morto, está a senhora baronesa disposta a pedir que seja realizada uma investigação para esclarecer estes acontecimentos trágicos? Se essa investigação revelar que houve uma relação de causa e efeito entre o espancamento e a morte do referido dissidente, está disposta a condenar esses actos?
A persistência neste rumo levará inevitavelmente ao intensificar da luta social que por toda a Europa e também em Portugal se tem travado.
A pesca é uma actividade económica essencial para os países europeus, em especial para os países marítimos, como é o caso daquele de onde venho, e, como tal, este Parlamento tem que estar especialmente atento às condições que afectam a população que se dedica à pesca.
A política agrícola comum (PAC) deveria sofrer uma reforma de modo a poder responder melhor aos desafios da segurança alimentar, das alterações climáticas, da gestão sustentável dos recursos naturais, da gestão da paisagem e da manutenção de uma economia rural dinâmica. É necessário tornar o sector mais competitivo e a PAC mais justa, ecológica, rentável, eficaz e eficiente.
A política agrícola comum continua a ser uma dimensão fundamental da política comunitária e do orçamento da UE. Não podemos impor restrições adicionais às nossas explorações agrícolas, que têm de fazer face a uma concorrência crescente a nível global, e, ao mesmo tempo, reduzir o apoio prestado.
A política ambiental europeia apenas pode ser avaliada de forma aprofundada se estiverem disponíveis dados fiáveis. A reciclagem, as emissões para a atmosfera, as alterações climáticas e o consumo e a produção sustentáveis são domínios que têm de ser continuamente acompanhados para que neles sejam alcançados progressos em toda a Europa.
A política cultural permite também que a UE crie ligações a outros países com os quais não foi acordada qualquer outra forma de parceria. O apoio à dimensão cultural dos países do Norte de África que estão a construir uma sociedade nova e mais democrática é também especialmente importante. O desenvolvimento bilateral e os acordos comerciais devem sempre exigir não apenas elementos de responsabilidade social, mas também elementos culturais.
A política de ajuda ao desenvolvimento não é nem uma obrigação altruísta, nem um meio de as antigas potências coloniais ficarem de consciência tranquila nos casos em que houve colonização. É, de direito próprio, um dos ramos da política externa; contudo, deveria ser também parte importante de uma estratégia de inversão dos fluxos migratórios que permitisse às populações permanecerem ou regressarem ao seu país de origem e aí viverem com dignidade e crescente prosperidade.
A política de coesão baseia-se na boa governação a nível europeu, nacional, regional e local.
A política de coesão continua a ser um dos mais importantes pilares das políticas da União Europeia, sendo fundamental para a concretização dos objectivos da estratégia UE2020. A política de coesão, por isso mesmo, deve continuar a apoiar firmemente todas as regiões europeias, contribuindo para um crescimento inteligente, sustentável e inclusivo.
A política de coesão deve ser orientada para os resultados através do estabelecimento de objectivos claros e mensuráveis e de indicadores de resultados. A política de coesão deve ainda promover a transparência e, para monitorizar, para termos esta transparência, defendo que a informação relativa à aprovação e execução dos projectos seja disponibilizada em tempo real por nomenclatura das unidades territoriais e estatísticas mais pormenorizadas, de forma a que todo o público tenha acesso.
A política de coesão económica, social e territorial é um dos pilares fundamentais de uma União Europeia dedicada não só a promover e a desenvolver a excelência, favorecendo a inovação, mas também a criar convergência e a reduzir as disparidades das e nas zonas menos desenvolvidas em comparação com as mais avançadas. A programação conjunta foi o aspecto mais inovador do período de 2007-2013, tendo induzido as regiões e os Estados-Membros a adoptar uma abordagem integrada entre territórios e recursos como parte da sua programação estratégica e operacional.
A política de coesão tem de ser um instrumento eficaz para responder aos desafios socioeconómicos gerados pela crise financeira e reduzir as disparidades entre os níveis de desenvolvimento das regiões europeias.
A política de coesão tem hoje um potencial maior do que alguma vez teve, facto que não deve ser subestimado; é capaz de melhorar regiões menos desenvolvidas, caracterizadas por desvantagens geográficas ou naturais permanentes.
A política de coesão tem por finalidade o crescimento económico sustentável e inclusivo, uniformemente distribuído pela Europa, e a redução de disparidades entre regiões. Para aumentar as sinergias, cumpre adoptar um quadro estratégico único que reforçará a integração das políticas da UE para efeitos de realização da estratégia Europa 2020. É evidente que um planeamento integrado permite utilizar os Fundos Estruturais de forma a contribuírem para a concretização dos objectivos da política europeia de coesão. Um desses objectivos é a redistribuição dos recursos europeus que não foram utilizados em certas regiões por outras regiões mais eficazes mas sempre dentro do mesmo Estado-Membro.
A política de coesão é a melhor prova da solidariedade que existe na União Europeia. A Polónia, e em particular regiões pobres como a que eu represento - Lubelskie Voivodship - utilizaram estes fundos para um desenvolvimento rápido.
A política de coesão é a política-chave para o futuro do projecto europeu. A construção de um espaço comum, com um mercado interno e uma moeda própria, exige, para poder funcionar, um determinado nível de convergência dos seus Estados-Membros e das suas regiões. As divergências actuais de competitividade e as assimetrias de desenvolvimento conduziram inevitavelmente à fragilização do espaço europeu e à crise que afecta a zona euro. É por isso que esta necessidade vital de convergência precisa, em absoluto, de um orçamento para a coesão poderoso e que não pode ser enfraquecido para financiar outras políticas. A União Europeia, para fazer mais, tem de ter mais, e isso obtém-se fazendo crescer o seu orçamento e não reduzindo, mesmo que habilidosamente, o orçamento da coesão.
A política de coesão é um dos pilares da política económica da UE. Constitui uma garantia de apoio para regiões menos desenvolvidas e grupos desfavorecidos, conducente a um desenvolvimento social e territorial equilibrado na União, além de representar um plano de acção com grande significado para os 27 Estados-Membros que são solicitados a definir as orientações estratégicas do desenvolvimento territorial, através de um envolvimento cada vez mais activo dos parceiros sociais. O meu voto a favor deste relatório confirma a minha confiança neste objectivo, mas também a minha consciência da necessidade de simplificar disposições a nível nacional e regional a fim de executar projectos dentro dos prazos estabelecidos, evitar a morosidade burocrática e reduzir encargos administrativos, aumentando assim a sua capacidade de absorção.
A política de coesão é um pilar da estratégia Europa 2020; por conseguinte, o dinheiro atribuído à política de coesão no próximo quadro financeiro comum não deveria ser inferior aos montantes disponibilizados no actual período de programação. Procuramos actualmente recursos para novos objectivos que aumentem a competitividade da Europa.
A política de coesão é um pilar fundamental das políticas da UE e um dos motores para a criação de uma Europa a uma só velocidade, uma vez que contribui para melhorar o ambiente socioeconómico.
A política de coesão é um pilar fundamental do desenvolvimento socioeconómico, e os Estados-Membros receberam positivamente os novos requisitos e estão, rapidamente, a reconhecer as orientações da UE, realizando progressos relevantes na consecução dos objectivos da política de coesão. É o que resulta do relatório sobre o Relatório de 2010.
A política de coesão é vital para eliminar as disparidades entre as regiões da Europa, para sair da crise e para atingir um crescimento inteligente, sustentável e inclusivo.
A política de defesa é uma das áreas mais ciosamente guardadas pelos Estados-Membros. A impressão que nos fica deste relatório, ou, de facto, de outros relatórios sobre o mesmo assunto ou sobre política externa, é que a intenção é empurrar a União Europeia no sentido de assegurar que, gradualmente, obtenha um ascendente sobre os Estados-Membros na definição da política externa e de defesa.
A política de inovação deve acompanhar a política no domínio da formação profissional e do mercado de trabalho.
A política em relação aos países da Europa Oriental reveste-se de especial importância do ponto de vista da Polónia. O relatório reconhece que deve haver integração política e económica com os vizinhos da UE e pede também uma abordagem coerente nas negociações de um novo acordo com a Rússia, tendo em atenção o Estado de direito e a protecção dos direitos humanos naquele país. Reconhece igualmente que as negociações para a adesão da Turquia devem ser intensificadas e que deve haver um empenhamento permanente no processo de adesão dos países balcânicos.
A política europeia de asilo está condenada ao fracasso em razão dos efeitos colaterais indesejáveis de propostas anteriores: o Regulamento de Dublim destinava-se a prevenir o turismo de asilo.
A política europeia de coesão é e continuará a ser uma pedra angular da actividade tangível da UE nas suas regiões, assim como a principal fonte de investimento na economia real, capaz de ajudar a Europa e as suas regiões a recuperar da crise e a ganhar de novo competitividade. O Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional e os outros Fundos Estruturais já fizeram muito mas podem e devem fazer mais e melhor pela União Europeia. É neste espírito que concordo com o conteúdo e a estrutura do relatório do senhor deputado Stavrakakis, ao qual dou o meu apoio.
A política externa da UE sofreu um forte incremento após a entrada em vigor do Tratado de Lisboa. A União Europeia necessita de uma estratégia de política externa coerente, assente nos objectivos e princípios consagrados no artigo 21.º do TUE. A acção da União na cena internacional assenta nos princípios que presidiram à sua criação, desenvolvimento e alargamento, sendo seu objectivo promover em todo o mundo: a democracia, o Estado de direito, a universalidade e indivisibilidade dos direitos do Homem e das liberdades fundamentais, o respeito pela dignidade humana, os princípios da igualdade e solidariedade e o respeito pelos princípios da Carta das Nações Unidas e do direito internacional.
A política social externa da União Europeia, orientada para os países que não pretendem aderir à UE, deve, em primeiro lugar, ser coerente, pragmática e uniforme.
A posição da Comissão é louvável: torna os Estados-Membros responsáveis pela gestão segura, incluindo a eliminação, do combustível irradiado e dos resíduos radioactivos que geram, através da elaboração dos seus próprios programas.
A possibilidade de um aumento marginal de 5 % nos orçamentos europeus só parece muito à luz das opiniões de sua Majestade a Rainha de Inglaterra.
A preocupação essencial pode ser resumida como aquela que subjaz à impressão de que aquela que é uma maioria política muito ampla, uma maioria de dois terços, mas mesmo assim uma maioria política circunstancial no Parlamento húngaro, conseguiu impor uma reforma constitucional que condiciona a realização do pluralismo político e, consequentemente, a possibilidade de alternar entre diferentes projectos políticos sob um mesmo conjunto de regras.
A presente directiva apoia o bom funcionamento do mercado interno através do nível de harmonização das unidades de medida que prescreve.
A presente directiva destina-se a assegurar que os Estados-Membros estabeleçam um quadro regulamentar e organizativo nacional e elaborem programas nacionais adequados para a gestão de combustível irradiado e de resíduos radioactivos, independentemente das perspectivas das aplicações da energia nuclear, ligadas ou não à produção de electricidade.
A presente proposta de directiva é o resultado de uma revisão do acervo do consumidor, que começou em 2004 com o objectivo de simplificar e completar o quadro regulamentar existente relativo à protecção dos consumidores. A proposta visa garantir que, por um lado, os consumidores dos 27 Estados-Membros possam contar com um elevado nível de protecção e, por outro lado, que as empresas, independentemente da sua dimensão, possam fornecer produtos e serviços a consumidores dos 27 Estados-Membros sem que tenham de enfrentar entraves jurídicos desnecessários. A fim de evitar a fragmentação cada vez maior das regulamentações existentes neste sector, procurou-se encontrar uma harmonização integral orientada, ou seja, uma harmonização limitada a aspectos específicos de certos contratos, e manter, ao mesmo tempo, um elevado nível de protecção dos consumidores.
A presente proposta de relatório incide sobre algumas modificações a introduzir no artigo 51.º do Regimento sobre o funcionamento do Parlamento Europeu (PE), na sequência da criação de um grupo de trabalho encarregado de proceder a uma revisão do mesmo e na sequência de uma decisão da Conferência dos Presidentes.
A presente proposta de resolução comum do Parlamento Europeu (PE) aborda a problemática da crise no sector europeu das pescas por causa do aumento contínuo nos preços dos combustíveis, que se reflecte, de uma forma muito significativa, nos seus custos operacionais.
A presente proposta de resolução comum do Parlamento Europeu versa sobre a renovação do Protocolo de Acordo de Parceria no domínio da pesca entre a Comunidade Europeia e a República Islâmica da Mauritânia cujo período de vigência termina no dia 31 de Julho de 2012. A Comissão Europeia, consciente da importância da renovação desta parceria e nos termos do mandato do Conselho, deu início a um processo que visa a renovação deste Protocolo, no pleno respeito do artigo 218.º do Tratado sobre o Funcionamento da União Europeia. O actual acordo com a Mauritânia tem contribuído para o desenvolvimento económico da Mauritânia, onde o sector das pescas é um dos pilares fundamentais da economia, representando cerca de 10 % do PIB, 29 % do rendimento do orçamento nacional e quase 50 % das exportações. Mas é também essencial à União Europeia (UE), em particular às suas frotas pesqueiras.
A presente proposta de resolução do Parlamento Europeu (PE) aborda a problemática sobre a igualdade de acesso aos mercados do sector público na União Europeia (UE) e em países terceiros e sobre a revisão do quadro jurídico dos contratos públicos com a inclusão das concessões. Vários são os documentos que a UE tem aprovado sobre esta matéria, desde directivas (2004/18/CE, 2004/17/CE, 93/13/CE e 2007/66/CE), resoluções (PE, 18 de Maio de 2010), relatórios (Mário Monti, Uma nova estratégia para o Mercado Único - ao serviço da economia e da sociedade europeias), a Comunicação da Comissão Europeia Um Acto para o Mercado Único - Para uma economia social de mercado altamente competitiva e o Livro Verde da Comissão Europeia sobre a modernização da política de contratos públicos da UE.
A presente proposta de resolução do Parlamento Europeu debruça-se sobre a análise do Small Business Act (SBA), conjunto de princípios políticos que visam apoiar as pequenas e médias empresas (PME) a nível do acesso ao financiamento e aos mercados, bem como uma melhoria da legislação. O papel das PME na União Europeia (UE), a nível social, económico e financeiro, é inquestionável.
A presente proposta de resolução do Parlamento Europeu sobre a conclusão de acordos aéreos internacionais incorpora muitos dos princípios-chave defendidos pela Lega Nord.
A presente proposta de resolução do Parlamento Europeu versa sobre um acordo de comércio livre entre a União Europeia e o Japão, a terceira maior economia do mundo em termos de PIB.
A presente proposta de resolução solicita à Comissão que aborde a questão do acesso equilibrado aos mercados do sector público, bem como que proceda à revisão dos contratos públicos e das concessões, permitindo assim o envolvimento do Parlamento Europeu, dos Estados-Membros e dos cidadãos e empresas.
A presente proposta refere-se à simples codificação das regras já em vigor para as menções ou marcas que permitem identificar o lote ao qual pertence um género alimentício, sem fazer qualquer alteração substantiva sobre a qual este Parlamento se deva pronunciar.
A presente proposta refere-se à simples codificação das regras já em vigor para o nível sonoro admissível e o dispositivo de escape dos veículos a motor. Não é feita qualquer alteração substantiva sobre a qual este Parlamento se deva, especialmente, pronunciar.
A presente proposta serve apenas para a codificação dos textos já existentes, no que respeita ao nível sonoro admissível e ao dispositivo de escape dos veículos a motor, sem que daqui advenha qualquer alteração substantiva aos mesmos.
A presente proposta serve apenas para a codificação dos textos já existentes, no que respeita aos dispositivos de protecção montados na retaguarda em caso de capotagem de tractores agrícolas e florestais com rodas de via estreita, sem que daqui advenha qualquer alteração substantiva aos mesmos.
A presente proposta serve apenas para a codificação dos textos já existentes, no que respeita aos impostos especiais sobre o consumo de tabacos manufacturados, sem que daqui advenha qualquer alteração substantiva aos mesmos.
A presente proposta serve apenas para a codificação dos textos já existentes, no que respeita aos valores faciais e especificações técnicas das moedas em euros destinadas a circulação, sem que daqui advenha qualquer alteração substantiva aos mesmos.
A presente proposta serve apenas para a codificação dos textos já existentes, no que respeita às unidades de medida, sem que daqui advenha qualquer alteração substantiva aos mesmos.
A presente recomendação para segunda leitura refere-se à posição do Conselho sobre a adopção do regulamento do Parlamento Europeu (PE) e do Conselho no que respeita às denominações das fibras têxteis e à correspondente etiquetagem e marcação de composição em fibras dos produtos têxteis. O sector dos têxteis é muito complexo e representa uma fatia significativa da actividade económica nos Estados-Membros. O relator conseguiu um acordo em matérias tão controversas como a marcação de origem, as partes não têxteis de origem animal, substâncias perigosas, etc.
A presente recomendação, elaborada por Debora Serracchiani e tendo por base a proposta de decisão do Conselho sobre a assinatura de um Acordo entre a União Europeia (UE) e a República da Croácia, versa sobre o interesse manifestado pela República da Croácia em integrar o Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência.
A presente resolução debruça-se sobre o pedido da Bósnia e Herzegovina para que a sua capital, Sarajevo, seja considerada, em 2014, Capital Europeia da Cultura. A iniciativa comunitária Capital Europeia da Cultura foi criada para realçar as riquezas e diversidades culturais europeias, partilhando-as e promovendo o entendimento mútuo entre europeus.
A presente resolução do Parlamento Europeu (PE) debruça-se sobre a proposta de Convenção da Organização Internacional do Trabalho (OIT), complementada por uma recomendação sobre os trabalhadores domésticos.
A presente resolução do Parlamento Europeu, de 9 de Junho de 2011, sobre práticas enganosas nos directórios de empresas, emite um alerta à Comissão para que acelere as suas actividades no tocante à revisão e ao aperfeiçoamento da Directiva, e demais legislação pertinente referente a este assunto, para acabar o mais depressa possível com as práticas enganosas utilizadas por editores de directórios de empresas, nomeadamente colocando especificamente na lista negra as práticas enganosas utilizadas por directórios de empresas.
A presente resolução visa dar o ponto de vista do Parlamento Europeu relativamente à análise do Small Business Act efectuada pela Comissão. Neste âmbito, o PE, através da presente resolução, manifesta o seu apoio: às novas propostas destinadas a melhorar o acesso ao financiamento e aos mercados pelas PME; às medidas para continuar o processo de desburocratização através do reforço da governação e do seguimento; a uma regulamentação inteligente; e a medidas como a avaliação de desempenho das PME.
A presença de materiais derivados de animais deve ser claramente indicada, de modo a evitar que os consumidores ou pessoas que sofram de alergias corram o risco de comprar inadvertidamente produtos em pele verdadeira quando prefeririam não o fazer.
A prevenção é a melhor cura e, portanto, acredito sinceramente que os recursos da UE previstos para o Sudão deviam ser afectados não só à ajuda humanitária e ao desenvolvimento, mas também ao apoio ao controlo democrático e ao Estado de direito, que são pré-condições essenciais à implementação dos direitos humanos fundamentais do povo sudanês devastado pela guerra.
A primeira conclusão é a seguinte: "ao ponderar sobre as causas directas do acidente Fukushima, não vemos qualquer razão para pôr em causa o funcionamento das centrais nucleares ou de outras instalações nucleares no Reino Unido". Na segunda conclusão refere-se: "em resposta ao acidente de Fukushima, a indústria da energia nuclear no Reino Unido tem reagido de forma responsável e adequada, revelando liderança em matéria de segurança, bem como uma forte cultura de segurança na sua resposta até à data". Na quarta conclusão afirma-se: "até à data, a análise das circunstâncias conhecidas do acidente Fukushima não revelou quaisquer lacunas no âmbito ou no rigor dos princípios que presidem à avaliação da segurança nas instalações nucleares no Reino Unido".
A primeira e mais importante é a mensagem para o Conselho de Ministros.
A primeira fase do inventário permitiu-nos identificar lacunas existentes bem como necessidades e condições para o corpo de voluntários fazer um contributo positivo para a assistência humanitária da UE. Este ano, 2011, a principal actividade é desenvolver mais a abordagem, incluindo uma consulta pública aos interessados cujos resultados estarão disponíveis no final deste mês, Maio de 2011.
A primeira infância é o momento precípuo para as crianças desenvolverem um conjunto de capacidades cognitivas e sociais cujos reflexos se farão sentir ao longo da vida.
A primeira observação que quero fazer é a seguinte: é preciso que alguns deputados desta Assembleia mostrem um pouco de humildade e um pouco de bom senso, porque fazem parecer que são os únicos que alguma vez pensaram sobre segurança nuclear e os únicos preocupados com o futuro dos seus filhos e da humanidade.
A primeira pergunta é a seguinte: Senhor Comissário, como pode Vossa Excelência garantir que será adoptada desta vez uma perspective a longo prazo, por oposição ao enfoque de curto prazo aplicado da última vez em relação aos bancos irlandeses?
A primeira é o facto de não existir absolutamente qualquer prova de que a facilitação do comércio beneficiará as pessoas afectadas pelas inundações. Pelo contrário, podemos inclusivamente verificar que a indústria têxtil do Paquistão está sedeada noutras regiões e, nos últimos anos, tem mesmo registado um crescimento.
A primeira: que orçamento é necessário para a Estratégia UE 2020 relativa ao crescimento e ao emprego?
A principal razão subjacente a este ataque da União Europeia, dos governos burgueses e do capital contra os rendimentos e os direitos das classes trabalhadoras, tendo como arma principal o acordo sobre o euro e o mecanismo europeu de estabilidade - leia-se mecanismo de bancarrota controlada -, vai para além da gestão capitalista da crise e da dívida. O objectivo estratégico da União Europeia, dos governos burgueses e do capital é unicamente transferir o peso da crise para os trabalhadores, mas reduzir ao mínimo a força de trabalho, de forma a proteger as margens de lucro dos grupos monopolistas.
A principal reivindicação, formulada no relatório, para atingir este objectivo é que as regras comuns em matéria de gestão e execução sejam adoptadas no âmbito geral da política de coesão e com o Fundo Europeu Agrícola de Desenvolvimento Rural e o Fundo Europeu das Pescas.
A principal tarefa do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência (OEDT) consiste em recolher dados sobre a droga e a toxicodependência, para elaborar e publicar informações objectivas, fiáveis e comparáveis a nível europeu. O OEDT está, na prática, aberto à participação de quaisquer países terceiros que partilhem o interesse da UE nesta matéria. A Croácia solicitou a sua participação no OEDT em 2005.
A proibição do pagamento de artigos directamente relacionados com o trabalho, nomeadamente uniformes, ferramentas ou equipamento de protecção, parece-me incompreensível.
A promoção de um crescimento económico inteligente, sustentável e inclusivo implica as melhores oportunidades e possibilidades possíveis na educação e na formação. A mobilidade durante os estudos, facilitada por programas da UE como o Erasmus, o Leonardo da Vinci e o Comenius, promove não apenas os aspectos da educação formal, mas também o desenvolvimento pessoal e social.
A proposta constitui igualmente um apoio à indústria transformadora europeia e uma garantia à sua actividade no contexto mundial.
A proposta da Comissão Europeia de uma directiva relativa aos direitos dos consumidores funde quatro directivas em vigor num único instrumento legislativo, com o objectivo de simplificar e completar o actual quadro regulamentar de protecção dos consumidores. O duplo objectivo da proposta é garantir que cada consumidor nos 27 Estados-Membros possa contar com um elevado nível de protecção do consumidor e que empresas de todas as dimensões possam fornecer os seus produtos e serviços a consumidores nos 27 Estados-Membros da UE.
A proposta da relatora vai no sentido de analisar a viabilidade de um instrumento facultativo neste domínio, que, formalizado através de um regulamento e complementado por uma caixa de ferramentas, permitiria assegurar a certeza e segurança jurídicas.
A proposta da senhora deputada Wallis na realidade representa a criação de um 28.º regime jurídico, para além dos regimes nacionais, que na prática pretende substituir; as palavras legislativas "harmonização” e "uniformização” são agora temidas no contexto político europeu.
A proposta de directiva apresentada pela Comissão estabelece um quadro jurídico da UE para a gestão do combustível irradiado e dos resíduos radioactivos. A proposta prevê requisitos para assegurar que os EstadosMembros estabeleçam um quadro regulamentar e organizativo nacional que lhes permita elaborar programas nacionais adequados para a gestão de combustível irradiado e de resíduos radioactivos, desde a sua geração até à sua eliminação. A proposta tem como base o Tratado Euratom e, em particular, as orientações fornecidas no "relatório sobre a Euratom - Balanço de 50 anos de política europeia no domínio da energia nuclear". A relatora define quatro prioridades principais entre as alterações apresentadas no projecto de relatório submetido à apreciação dos membros da comissão. A primeira é a necessidade de prever conceitos e soluções técnicas para a eliminação definitiva, nomeadamente a eliminação em camadas geológicas profundas. A segunda é a necessidade de assegurar a colocação em reserva de recursos financeiros adequados para satisfazer os requisitos do desmantelamento de centrais nucleares, bem como a eliminação dos resíduos resultantes. A terceira diz respeito ao desenvolvimento de instalações regionais para eliminação, enquanto a quarta trata da questão da transparência e participação do público.
A proposta de directiva destina-se a garantir que os Estados-Membros estabeleçam um quadro regulamentar e organizativo nacional e elaborem programas nacionais adequados para a gestão de combustível irradiado e de resíduos radioactivos, independentemente das perspectivas em termos de energia nuclear e de aplicações no domínio não nuclear.
A proposta de directiva sobre a qual o Parlamento Europeu foi consultado é mais um exemplo de que a Europa sabe agir de uma maneira prática para proteger os seus cidadãos. Organizar a harmonização das normas relativas à gestão do combustível irradiado e dos resíduos radioactivos responde a uma exigência e à necessidade de reforçar a segurança neste domínio.
A proposta de regulamento estabelece neste domínio um quadro comum para a recolha, a compilação, a transmissão e a avaliação das contas económicas europeias do ambiente, fornecendo uma metodologia comum à escala europeia, normas comuns, definições, classificações e regras contabilísticas destinadas a ser usadas na compilação dessas contas. O regulamento diz respeito à recolha e compilação de dados relativos às emissões atmosféricas, impostos ambientais aplicáveis a vários sectores económicos e à contabilização dos fluxos macroeconómicos de materiais.
A proposta de regulamento sobre as contas económicas ambientais europeias tem como objectivo fornecer instrumentos úteis à realização de alguns objectivos importantes, como é o desenvolvimento de uma estratégia europeia de contabilidade do ambiente e o alargamento do trabalho dos institutos de estatística, que facultam os dados sobre essa matéria aos órgãos administrativos.
A proposta de resolução da senhora deputada inglesa ao Parlamento Europeu Mary Honeyball tenta reduzir o papel do pai e da mãe de uma criança à de colaboradores com direitos iguais no sistema de ensino público. O relatório afirma textualmente (no n.º 14) que "[o Parlamento Europeu] salienta que tanto as mães como os pais são colaboradores com direitos iguais nos CEPI [cuidados e educação na primeira infância]; (...)”. Esta formulação exprime uma profunda desconfiança na família e no direito globalmente reconhecido dos pais a cuidarem dos seus filhos e a educarem-nos.
A proposta de resolução mostra claramente que subsistem ainda lacunas graves no que respeita ao cumprimento das disposições elementares do Tratado de Lisboa. Não será muito positivo para os Estados-Membros, quando o Parlamento Europeu (PE) solicita com urgência ao Conselho Europeu que desenvolva uma "estratégia europeia de política externa", ou quando exorta o Conselho Europeu "a prosseguir esta missão com base num diálogo político com o PE". Se já houvesse hoje uma estratégia para a política externa europeia, o equilíbrio da UE nesse aspecto seria muito superior, por exemplo, em relação aos movimentos no mundo árabe e aos critérios com dois ou três pesos e duas ou três medidas aplicados aos países da região.
A proposta de revisão da Directiva Eurovinheta aqui em causa visa introduzir o princípio do poluidor-pagador nos transportes rodoviários, permitindo que os Estados-Membros possam incluir os custos da poluição sonora e atmosférica nas portagens nacionais, o que se traduz na imposição de mais uma taxa aos veículos pesados.
A proposta em apreço cinge-se à codificação pura e simples dos textos existentes, sem alterações substantivas. Não há, por isso, qualquer motivo que justifique o meu voto negativo.
A proposta inicial de regulamento da UE só prevê a recolha e a compilação de dados sobre emissões para a atmosfera, impostos ambientais para várias actividades económicas e contas de fluxos de materiais para a economia.
A proposta terá três objectivos.
A propósito, Senhor Presidente, durante estas questões, houve um elemento específico que surgiu, nomeadamente que cada Mandado de Detenção custa 25 000 euros ao Tesouro Público.
A propósito, foram introduzidos controlos fronteiriços temporários com base no regime de Schengen de 2006 por ocasião do Campeonato Europeu de Futebol e do Campeonato Mundial de Futebol como forma de defesa contra o hooliganismo. Não vejo qualquer necessidade de apoiar uma iniciativa populista de dois chefes de governo - que foram encostados à parede nos seus próprios países e estão à procura de uma saída por meios populistas - com a apresentação de uma tal comunicação.
A propósito, posso constatar muitas sinergias entre a utilização dos espectros para a distribuição de conteúdo e cultura, referindo-me essencialmente ao conteúdo audiovisual para a banda larga sem fios. A televisão digital e a banda larga sem fios podem desenvolver-se com êxito e em paralelo, e não devemos esquecer que o acesso à Internet por banda larga também oferece um elevado valor cultural e social.
A propósito, surpreende-me que alguns deputados, à semelhança do senhor deputado Verhofstadt ontem, defendam uma estratégia de investimento enquanto aceitam este pacote. Não me parece coerente.
A prossecução dos objectivos da política de coesão europeia está indubitavelmente a avançar na direcção certa em muitos domínios, embora nesta fase possam já ser retiradas algumas lições dos progressos realizados até à data relativamente à construção das futuras prioridades da política de coesão europeia. A absorção relativamente pobre de fundos para infra-estruturas e para o ambiente deu origem à necessidade de uma revisão das ferramentas que encorajam o início de projectos nesta área.
A protecção das minorias húngaras no estrangeiro, a que o artigo D se aplica directamente, aplica-se igualmente aos cidadãos de etnia húngara que vivem nos países vizinhos.
A própria Comissão podia assumir um papel mais activo na colaboração com os Estados-Membros em matéria de controlo da aplicação da legislação a nível transfronteiras utilizando redes já existentes na União para facilitar a cooperação entre os Estados-Membros.
A própria adopção deste documento é questionável. Não existiu, ou existiu muito pouca, consulta social. O texto é apenas apoiado por um partido político, e a maioria dos constitucionalistas são contra o documento. A nova Constituição suscita questões a nível internacional.
A próxima Cimeira UE-Rússia deve constituir uma oportunidade para chamar a atenção para a situação na Bielorrússia. Não estou a falar de negociações com a Rússia sobre a Bielorrússia, já que isso, em última análise, implicaria que a Rússia tivesse algum tipo de "direitos especiais" sobre este país. No entanto, cabe-nos advertir a Rússia, ao mais alto nível, que é inaceitável reforçar a influência junto de um país vizinho através da exploração de uma situação e de negociações com um regime autoritário que não representa o povo.
A publicidade enganosa e as práticas comerciais desleais minam a confiança dos consumidores e com isso causam prejuízo ao mercado interno. É por isso fundamental que a legislação europeia proteja os consumidores e as empresas deste tipo de práticas.
A quase totalidade do mercado das notações de crédito, que por vezes são obrigatórias para fins regulamentares, é controlada por três grandes agências dos Estados Unidos.
A questão da aprendizagem nos primeiros anos de vida é o tema crucial deste relatório, que foca os seus impactos positivos ao nível do desenvolvimento cognitivo, físico, comportamental, afectivo e emocional.
A questão da cooperação para o desenvolvimento é um dos princípios fundamentais sobre os quais assenta o meu trabalho.
A questão da dívida, pela sua dimensão e constrangimentos associados, para além de um problema real para países como Portugal, constitui uma peça central da violenta ofensiva social, económica, política e ideológica em curso (que esconde as suas verdadeiras causas) - de que a mais recente expressão é a ilegítima intervenção em Portugal da troika FMI-CE-BCE.
A questão da falta de transparência e, daí, de credibilidade da informação utilizada pelas agências de notação de crédito suscita uma questão importante: é justo, é lógico, é moralmente correcto que as notações que afectam a economia e perturbam as vidas de milhões de cidadãos de repente não sejam transparentes e, eventualmente, não sejam credíveis? Claro que não.
A questão da gestão do combustível irradiado e dos resíduos radioactivos é de grande actualidade.
A questão da representação externa da área do euro, embora se relacione com a reforma geral do Fundo Monetário Internacional, não se prende directamente com a selecção do seu Director-Geral. A Comissão considera que é do interesse comum da Europa, da União e dos seus Estados-Membros avançar progressivamente no sentido da representação da União Europeia, ou pelo menos da área do euro, no FMI por um único membro.
A questão de Schengen não quer dizer apenas aquilo que agora consta da comunicação da Comissão; a expansão da zona Schengen está na agenda. A Presidência húngara separa claramente estas duas questões. Ninguém desejaria ignorar os dois países que investiram muito trabalho, energia e dinheiro na preparação adequada e no cumprimento dos rigorosos requisitos envolvidos na adesão à zona Schengen e destruir tudo isso dizendo que o clima actual não é o adequado.
A questão de uma maior eficácia e de mais sinergias entre os vários fundos estruturais reveste-se de grande importância no contexto do debate da futura política de coesão. A futura política de coesão deve ser simplificada e mais integrada.
A questão levantada por diversos oradores, a começar pelo senhor deputado Groote, e seguindo-se-lhe o senhor deputado Häfner, diz respeito ao registo obrigatório.
A questão mais importante que tem de ser discutida pela Comissão e pelas partes interessadas devia ser, portanto, a necessidade de devolver alguma confiança à população grega, sem a qual não será possível adoptar quaisquer medidas.
A questão que se coloca é a de saber se deveremos permitir sempre que os projectos sejam retalhados a nível local. A questão que se coloca é a de saber se deveremos permitir sempre que os projectos sejam divididos em fases separadas no tempo, se, em retrospectiva, se pode dizer que de facto tudo fazia parte de um plano global e devia ter sido visto como um todo desde o início.
A questão é que independentemente da importância que o Japão possa ter como parceiro comercial, os cidadãos europeus devem ser protegidos de qualquer risco proveniente de produtos contaminados com radiação.
A quitação pela execução do orçamento do Conselho Europeu é sempre complicada porque todos os anos se trava uma discussão entre as duas instituições, o Parlamento Europeu e o Conselho Europeu, relativamente ao processo de quitação.
A quota APD deve ser ainda mais rigorosa do que no quadro do actual ICD.
A química tornou possível a existência de vacinas e de antibióticos que duplicaram as nossas expectativas de vida e é fundamental para o desenvolvimento de novas fontes de energia e melhorar a alimentação. Além disso, a indústria química constitui um sector estratégico da Europa, com 25 000 empresas que empregam, directa ou indirectamente, cinco milhões de pessoas.
A radioactividade não é travada pelas fronteiras nacionais. A fim de proteger as populações da Europa e dos países vizinhos, a UE deve desenvolver uma estratégia de abandono da energia nuclear em toda a Europa, instar os seus vizinhos a abandonarem a energia nuclear como parte de sua política de vizinhança e, desta forma, evitar que sejam construídas novas centrais nucleares. O requisito prévio para o concretizar é a dissolução do Tratado Euratom, que é usado para promover a expansão da indústria nuclear.
A razão pela qual os Gregos estão nas ruas a protestar é o facto de eles compreenderem perfeitamente quais serão as consequências desta tomada de controlo pela UE/FMI. O dinheiro não está a ser canalizado para os cidadãos gregos, mas, sim, para as instituições financeiras que detêm a dívida pública grega.
A razão por que estas coisas acontecem reside no facto de os Estados-Membros ainda considerarem com demasiada frequência que as verbas do Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional são contribuições indirectas.
A razão por que é tão importante na actual conjuntura adoptar este pacote de medidas é porque temos de poder mostrar aos nossos cidadãos, aos agentes económicos e aos nossos parceiros internacionais que a União Europeia pode realmente, no futuro, evitar uma crise financeira como aquela que vivemos recentemente, por exemplo, no caso da Grécia.
A realidade dos últimos anos tem demonstrado à saciedade a falta de credibilidade das agências de notação de crédito.
A realidade é que há medidas dolorosas que são inevitáveis na Grécia e quem sustentar que assim não é está a mentir ao povo grego. O meu apelo aos líderes gregos é que expliquem ao povo grego, com toda a franqueza, as escolhas difíceis que o país tem de fazer.
A realidade é que há países fora da zona euro que têm problemas, pelo menos, comparáveis. A Islândia não é membro da zona euro e foi à bancarrota.
A realidade é que o que está em causa é salvar a face: salvar a face, para começar, dos eurocratas que lançaram o projecto e que se preparam para sacrificar os povos dos países periféricos e os contribuintes dos países pobres para sustentar a sua arrogância.
A realidade, em Estados-Membros como Portugal, é a do encerramento de milhares de estabelecimentos de ensino, a que acresce o desemprego juvenil e a precariedade laboral de milhares de professores, o subfinanciamento crónico do sistema de ensino superior público e o aumento dos custos da sua frequência. A realidade é a de orçamentos para a cultura reduzidos à indigência.
A recente crise financeira atraiu as atenções para três problemas fundamentais do sector das agências de notação, nomeadamente a falta de concorrência económica, o excesso de confiança nas notações externas no quadro regulamentar e o facto de as agências de notação não oferecerem qualquer garantia para as suas notações. Não estou certo de que a proposta do relator de criar uma Agência Europeia de Notação de Risco seja uma solução sensata. Não existe uma garantia de que a Agência Europeia de Notação de Risco obteria uma boa reputação e se tornaria de facto um novo actor entre as agências de notação, de que seria credível ou de que seria capaz de convencer o mercado da sua absoluta independência relativamente a qualquer órgão público, isto é, aos Estados-Membros, à Comissão Europeia ou a qualquer outra entidade pública.
A recente crise financeira demonstrou a necessidade de regular as agências de notação de crédito (ANC). Na verdade, os acontecimentos recentes propiciaram a possibilidade de identificar as falhas da sua acção e de reenquadrar o seu estatuto enquanto certificadores do objecto da sua análise: empresas, sector público e instrumentos financeiros estruturados.
A recente crise financeira realçou três problemas fundamentais no sector das agências de notação de crédito: falta de concorrência, devido à pouca importância destas agências nos mercados de capitais mundiais, bem como à incapacidade de competir, sobretudo em termos de normas regulamentares; excesso de confiança nas notações externas no quadro regulamentar para a formulação de normas, leis e regulamentos (por exemplo, a crescente utilização de notações de crédito externas para a definição de requisitos de fundos próprios), bem como a dependência dos bancos centrais das notações externas; e, por último, a ausência de responsabilização das agências pelas notações que publicam, a propósito do que o relatório também propõe a promoção de uma rede europeia de agências de notação. Neste contexto, concordamos com a importância da disponibilização mais vasta de informação para os investidores e que os participantes nos mercados só devem ser autorizados a investir em instrumentos financeiros derivados se puderem demonstrar que têm os conhecimentos e a capacidade para eles próprios avaliarem os riscos de crédito subjacentes. A concluir, apoiamos a proposta da criação de uma Fundação Europeia de Notação de Crédito totalmente independente e não pública.
A recente crise financeira veio reforçar a necessidade de olharmos para as questões deontológicas relacionadas com a gestão nas instituições financeiras de uma forma mais responsável.
A recente decisão da Alemanha de eliminar gradualmente a energia nuclear até 2022 marca uma nova etapa na nova linha de pensamento que se existe actualmente na Europa sobre a sua independência energética e as possíveis alternativas à energia nuclear.
A reciclagem e a prevenção de resíduos, as emissões atmosféricas e as alterações climáticas e o consumo e a produção sustentáveis poderão ser monitorizados de forma muito mais eficiente se dispusermos de dados de alta qualidade sobre a interacção entre os factores ambientais e económicos. A recolha dos dados pertinentes, que até hoje tem sido feita a título voluntário a nível da UE, deve portanto tornar-se obrigatória.
A reciclagem e a prevenção dos resíduos, as emissões para a atmosfera e as alterações climáticas, a par do consumo e da produção sustentáveis, seriam passíveis de uma melhor supervisão se se dispusesse de dados de qualidade que combinassem o ambiente com a economia. A recolha dos dados pertinentes, até agora feita a título voluntário a nível da UE, deve tornar-se obrigatória.
A recomendação é a última fase do processo de alteração da Directiva 1999/62/CE relativa à aplicação de imposições aos veículos pesados de mercadorias pela utilização de certas infra-estruturas (Eurovinheta). É o resultado de um longo processo de consultas e compromissos com os vários grupos políticos.
A reforma da PAC que iremos votar amanhã é fundamental para continuarmos a apoiar o rendimento dos nossos agricultores, como os meus colegas já referiram. O objectivo, portanto, não é reduzir os subsídios directos, mas sim encontrar um equilíbrio entre esses subsídios e o desenvolvimento rural, de modo a tornar o sistema mais simples e justo, sem que as regras da concorrência sejam postas em causa.
A região Bulgária-Turquia-Grécia constitui uma das zonas mais sensíveis das fronteiras externas da União Europeia no que respeita à migração ilegal.
A região do Mediterrâneo é muito importante, Senhor Comissário, mas não em detrimento de outras áreas da acção externa da União Europeia.
A regulação da imigração deve ser efectuada através de outro instrumento financeiro e deve conduzir ao reforço dos meios da agência FRONTEX.
A relatora referiu que as universidades estão subfinanciadas e, portanto, incentiva-as a procurarem mais financiamento junto de fontes privadas.
A relutância do Conselho em cooperar com o Parlamento no que respeita à quitação é extremamente preocupante.
A renovação deste Protocolo visa apoiar a sustentabilidade das frotas de pesca longínqua dos Estados-Membros, segmento de frota que tem sido particularmente atingido pela crise no sector das pescas nos últimos anos, objectivo e preocupação que, naturalmente, partilhamos. Não obstante, persistem também aqui algumas dúvidas, que não podemos deixar de assinalar, que são comuns a outros Acordos de Parceria no domínio da Pesca, quanto à efectividade dos proclamados objectivos no domínio da cooperação para o desenvolvimento sustentável do sector no país terceiro em questão e quanto à sustentabilidade e ao controlo do esforço de pesca exercido. São questões que importa clarificar no futuro.
A repressão está a aumentar, com a realização de julgamentos de ex-candidatos presidenciais e dos restantes activistas detidos.
A resistência a antibióticos é um sério problema que afecta a indústria pecuária, razão pela qual acompanho a Comissão da Agricultura nas suas preocupações sobre esta temática e nas suas propostas, não apenas para diminuir a resistência dos animais aos tratamentos com antibióticos, mas também para dinamizar outras formas de combate às doenças animais, que não passem necessariamente pela utilização de antibióticos.
A resistência antimicrobiana (RAM) representa um problema de saúde animal para o sector europeu da pecuária, em particular quando já foram publicadas em vários Estados-Membros orientações sobre o uso prudente de antimicrobianos, o que levou a um decréscimo na utilização destas substâncias.
A resistência antimicrobiana representa um problema de saúde animal para o sector europeu da pecuária, em particular quando o tratamento não é bem sucedido. Já foram publicadas em vários Estados-Membros orientações sobre o uso prudente de antibióticos, o que levou a um decréscimo na sua utilização. Se usados correctamente, os antimicrobianos são úteis para ajudar os agricultores a manter os seus animais saudáveis e produtivos e para assegurar o bem-estar desses animais.
A resistência aos antibióticos constitui um tema que temos de levar a sério e a que, até à data, se tem prestado muito pouca atenção no contexto da criação animal.
A resolução hoje aprovada apoia plenamente a posição da Comissão, que está em linha com as recomendações do Grupo Consultivo dos Serviços Jurídicos do Parlamento Europeu, do Conselho e da Comissão. Segundo o Grupo Consultivo, a proposta em apreço consiste na codificação pura e simples dos textos existentes, sem alterações substantivas.
A resolução hoje aprovada é um primeiro passo no sentido de darmos aos trabalhadores da Europa a possibilidade de se adaptarem às exigências da economia.
A resolução incide essencialmente sobre: 1) o domínio da regulação, apelando a uma melhor aplicação do "teste PME" - em especial à escala nacional - e à diminuição da burocracia e dos encargos financeiros; 2) a melhoria do acesso ao financiamento por parte das PME através de financiamentos e instrumentos financeiros adicionais disponibilizados pelo Banco Europeu de Investimento (nomeadamente o MFPR e financiamento de capitais próprios) e de um PCI alargado (e independente); 3) as melhorias necessárias para garantir a participação das PME nos concursos públicos; 4) a simplificação e uma melhor orientação dos programas de I&D&I de forma a promover a capacidade de gestão da inovação das PME, o acesso destas últimas aos serviços de I&D&I e outros serviços às empresas baseados no conhecimento, através, por exemplo, de centros de transferência de tecnologia e universidades; 5) a necessidade de ser dada mais atenção a questões sociais e laborais que afectam a actividade empresarial e a capacidade das PME em realizar o seu potencial de emprego, nomeadamente o desenvolvimento de competências ao nível da gestão, da informática e da sustentabilidade; 6) acções destinadas a melhorar a eficiência em termos de recursos: projectos para as PME a nível sectorial com o objectivo de identificar inovações eficientes em termos de recursos no âmbito das cadeias de valor e de abastecimento; a adopção de um plano de acção de inovação ecológica ambicioso e a afectação de mais fundos para o mesmo através do PCI; medidas mais rentáveis em matéria de eficiência energética com vista a auxiliar as PME a reduzir as suas facturas energéticas.
A resolução legislativa do Parlamento Europeu sobre a proposta de directiva do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho relativa ao nível sonoro admissível e ao dispositivo de escape dos veículos a motor irá ajudar a atingir o objectivo principal da proposta, ou seja, proceder a uma codificação da Directiva 70/157/CEE do Conselho, de 6 de Fevereiro de 1970, relativa à aproximação das legislações dos Estados-Membros relativas ao nível sonoro admissível e ao dispositivo de escape dos veículos a motor.
A resolução legislativa do Parlamento Europeu sobre a proposta de directiva do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho relativa aos dispositivos de protecção montados à frente em caso de capotagem, dos tractores agrícolas ou florestais com rodas de via estreita é muito oportuna. O objectivo da presente proposta consiste em proceder a uma codificação da Directiva 87/402/CEE do Conselho, de 25 de Junho de 1987, relativa aos dispositivos de protecção montados à frente em caso de capotagem, dos tractores agrícolas ou florestais com rodas de via estreita.
A resolução parlamentar aprovada hoje envia um sinal a forte todos os Estados-Membros para que assinem esta convenção, que tem poderes, espero sinceramente, para reforçar a inclusão social dos trabalhadores, concedendo-lhes acesso aos direitos sociais normais que assistem a todos os trabalhadores.
A resolução que vamos votar esta semana irá proporcionar a linha orientadora para as próximas negociações sobre o instrumento de desenvolvimento da próxima geração. Espero que esta Assembleia dê o seu amplo apoio às propostas da Comissão do Desenvolvimento, que foram elaboradas por meio de uma investigação discreta mas com base na nossa experiência das negociações a que atendemos - e lembro ao Parlamento que nós integrámos 14 regulamentos num único regulamento no ICD.
A resolução refere ainda o potencial das PME para a poupança energética - actualmente, apenas 24% das PME estão envolvidas em acções de redução do respectivo impacto ambiental através da melhoria da eficiência energética; se as PME aplicassem medidas rentáveis de eficiência energética, conseguiriam reduzir as respectivas facturas energéticas e aumentar o reinvestimento.
A resolução relativa às denominações das fibras têxteis e à correspondente etiquetagem e marcação dos produtos têxteis, aprovada pelo Parlamento Europeu, é particularmente importante para o sector têxtil da União Europeia.
A resolução sobre a resistência aos antibióticos surge num contexto em que a resistência antimicrobiana (RAM) representa um problema de saúde animal para o sector europeu da pecuária, que necessita de contar com a segurança e a eficácia dos tratamentos antimicrobianos num futuro próximo.
A resolução votada hoje apresenta uma série de medidas que visam diminuir a actual dependência de um número muito reduzido de fontes de notações. Para além de um aumento da concorrência, essas medidas incluem uma crescente e mais criteriosa utilização das notações de crédito internas por parte de grandes instituições financeiras capazes de realizar as suas próprias avaliações de risco.
A resolução é a expressão da preocupação do Parlamento com o estado do sector das pescas, com as condições económicas das empresas de pesca e com o preço do peixe no mercado.
A respeito da iniciativa Juventude em Movimento, apresentada pelo senhor deputado Zver, é muito provavelmente verdade que este programa de mobilidade é uma história de sucesso e que o relatório, com grande mérito, analisa ainda mais aprofundadamente a matéria.
A resposta a esta pergunta é que a capacidade de falar grego é exigida pelos eurodeputados.
A resposta das autoridades neerlandesas demonstra claramente que os Estados-Membros se preocupam sobretudo com o que acontece no seu próprio território.
A resposta à pressão migratória não é a reintrodução de controlos nas fronteiras internas, mas a agilização das negociações em curso com o objectivo de adoptar o pacote de medidas para os refugiados, a política europeia comum de migração e o sistema de avaliação de Schengen o mais cedo possível.
A restrição dos poderes do Tribunal Constitucional já foi referida e, em nome do meu grupo, gostaria igualmente de mencionar a natureza discriminatória da Constituição para com os membros de minorias sexuais, uma vez que não proíbe a discriminação com base na orientação sexual.
A reunião do Conselho de Cooperação UE-Ucrânia que se realiza nas próximas semanas dar-nos-á a oportunidade de debatermos numerosas questões que são importantes para a nossa relação e de enviar sinais claros à Ucrânia, que são os mesmos que os Senhores estão a mandar, sobre a importância de fazer reformas nesta área.
A revelação mais importante que emergiu da crise financeira e económica foi a de que temos um sistema extremamente ganancioso. O sector financeiro não estava apenas concentrado em lucros a médio prazo, mas estava também a subverter os esforços de introdução de um crescimento sustentável. O relatório em apreço contém importantes ilações a tirar da crise financeira relativamente à questão do risco, dos conselhos de administração, das autoridades de supervisão, dos accionistas e da remuneração. Assim sendo, votei favoravelmente o presente relatório.
A revisão da Directiva Eurovinheta obriga a que os veículos pesados de mercadorias que circulam nas auto-estradas europeias fiquem sujeitos ao princípio do poluidor-pagador, permitindo que os Estados-Membros possam incluir os custos da poluição sonora e atmosférica nas portagens nacionais. O custo adicional médio deverá situar-se entre os três e os quatro cêntimos por veículo/quilómetro.
A revisão da Directiva Eurovinheta é crucial, a fim de integrar de forma mais eficaz o custo da poluição causada pelo transporte rodoviário, o que passa agora a ser permitido graças à possibilidade de os Estados-Membros terem em conta a poluição atmosférica e sonora, bem como o congestionamento de algumas rotas na definição das taxas de portagens sobre veículos pesados de mercadorias.
A revisão da directiva em conformidade com a posição do Parlamento Europeu trará efeitos consideravelmente negativos em termos de competitividade e de desenvolvimento da economia de vários Estados-Membros, como é o caso de Portugal.
A salvaguarda adequada do local da explosão continua a constituir uma questão por resolver. O trabalho da construção de um sarcófago foi suspenso por falta de fundos, sendo, por conseguinte, essencial a ajuda da UE para tornar possível a conclusão do trabalho. Não fujamos, porém, à energia atómica, que constitui um instrumento ideal para estabelecermos a independência energética da Europa.
A seguir ao pepino, ao tomate, à alface e aos brotos de feijão, qual será a próxima vítima desta psicose sanitária? As consequências económicas são graves para os agricultores.
A segunda consideração diz respeito ao facto de ter sido feita referência a um grande teste para a Europa e ao receio de o projecto fracassar e os velhos fantasmas que julgávamos desaparecidos para sempre regressarem à União Europeia.
A segunda luta possui uma continuidade muito maior e é mais pungente.
A segunda parte da resposta é, naturalmente, uma abordagem rigorosa à administração, um crescimento zero da Comissão e aquilo a que chamamos de prioridades negativas identificadas numa avaliação exigente dos programas - apurar se estão ou não a funcionar - e, com base no desempenho, nalgumas áreas, orçamentando abaixo da programação financeira pré-existente para 2012.
A segunda questão diferente e que temos dificuldade em aceitar diz respeito ao espectro destinado ao acesso a satélite por banda larga; a Comissão quer ser capaz de assegurar efectivamente a sua disponibilidade.
A segunda questão prende-se com o facto de as economias mais fortemente afectadas pela crise terem de lidar com uma combinação de prémios de risco elevados e com rigorosas medidas de austeridades.
A segunda respeita à questão da obrigatoriedade. O Registo já é obrigatório.
A segurança alimentar é outra prioridade da nova política agrícola comum. A cooperação entre os EstadosMembros é essencial, como ficou demonstrado durante a crise E. coli neste Verão. Para evitar flutuações nos preços dos alimentos, apoio a adopção de medidas adicionais de prevenção de riscos, em benefício de todos os agricultores da UE.
A senhora Comissária Reding já declarou, e sublinho este facto, que uma ordem de extradição pode demorar até um ano, enquanto um Mandado de Detenção Europeu pode concretizar-se em 40 dias.
A senhora Vice-Presidente/Alta Representante Ashton proferiu várias declarações gerais e específicas sobre a situação na Bielorrússia.
A senhora deputada Honeyball destaca a investigação e o intercâmbio de melhores práticas, a utilização sensata dos fundos estruturais e de programas como o Comenius e, por fim, a necessidade de os Estados assumirem o seu papel fundamental nos primeiros anos da educação das crianças para garantir um crescimento inteligente, inclusivo e sustentável.
A senhora deputada Koppa perguntou também se a Comissão irá propor uma revisão do princípio da responsabilidade exclusiva do Estado onde é efectuada a primeira entrada ilegal.
A senhora deputada Wallis assevera que o Parlamento Europeu aplica sempre os mesmos princípios em relação ao levantamento da imunidade dos seus membros, o que é uma mentira cínica.
A si, Senhora Baronesa Ashton, convidamo-la a intensificar esforços no sentido de construir um consenso entre os Estados-Membros, bem como a fazer uso das suas múltiplas funções para reforçar a coerência entre a PCSD, a Política Externa e de Segurança Comum (PESC) e as restantes dimensões da acção externa da União. O Serviço Europeu de Acção Externa é um instrumento com enorme potencial para a execução dessa tarefa. O relatório apresenta diversas propostas sobre o papel que o SEAE deverá desempenhar, começando pelo de um conselho de gestão de crises, capaz de dar uma resposta verdadeiramente integrada a estas últimas.
A simplificação das regras de elegibilidade e dos processos financeiros constitui um objectivo prioritário da Comissão na perspectiva do próximo quadro financeiro plurianual.
A situação chegou a tal ponto que estamos a ponderar a criação de uma agência de privatizações baseada no modelo da alemã Treuhand. A agência alemã Treuhand fez coisas bem feitas, Senhor Deputado Lange.
A situação concreta de países como Portugal demonstra-o, com mais pessoas em situação de pobreza, mais desemprego e aumento das desigualdades. O projecto de Orçamento para 2012 deve ter esta realidade em conta, apoiando a produção em cada Estado-Membro, a criação de riqueza, o combate ao desemprego e à criação de emprego com direitos, o combate às desigualdades sociais e à pobreza, a defesa e a promoção dos serviços públicos.
A situação económica de um grande número de empresas deteriorou-se nos últimos anos, levando mesmo ao desaparecimento de muitas delas, sendo real o risco de desaparecimento de milhares de empresas de pesca e de destruição de milhares de postos de trabalho, devido ao aumento do preço dos combustíveis.
A situação geopolítica na região do Sul do Mediterrâneo passa neste momento por uma mudança radical.
A situação no Japão e na central nuclear de Fukushima Daiichi, na sequência do terramoto e do tsunami de 11 de Março de 2011, continua a ser motivo de preocupação. Isto, associado ao 25º aniversário da catástrofe nuclear de Chernobil, que assolou a Ucrânia em 26 de Abril de 1986, adverte os dirigentes europeus para as suas responsabilidades em matéria de segurança nuclear na Europa. É por isso que os Estados-Membros devem tomar todas as medidas necessárias para assegurar e manter o máximo nível de segurança nas centrais nucleares europeias e o máximo nível de protecção dos cidadãos. No entanto, importa manter a cabeça fria quando se abordam os desafios energéticos presentes e futuros.
A situação é a que a seguir se apresenta e temos o exemplo de Damüls, nos Alpes, e também o dos Pirinéus: acontece frequentemente que o tempo que decorre entre o momento em que é apresentada uma queixa por alguns cidadãos europeus e a resolução do problema pode ser demasiado para que a questão seja resolvida sem que dela resultem danos irreversíveis.
A soberania decorre do povo. E os povos da Europa não conferiram soberania a uma UE cada vez mais anti-social e antidemocrática.
A solidariedade europeia inclui a necessidade de financiar a Estratégia UE 2020, nomeadamente os seus objectivos sociais, que incluem o combate à pobreza. O relatório também me persuadiu de que a solidariedade europeia deve ser reforçada através da criação de regiões intermédias para que a política de coesão permita uma cobertura justa de toda a Europa.
A solução terá de ser bidireccional: deve ser aliviado o fardo administrativo que incide sobre as empresas que reciclam e eliminam resíduos perigosos legalmente e em paralelo, naturalmente, os produtores de resíduos perigosos devem ser incentivados a optar pela via legal e a travar a máfia dos resíduos perigosos.
A sua utilização para fins não militares pode representar um importante contributo na prestação de serviços públicos, com oportunidades de cooperação e de avanço na ciência e tecnologia, na troca e acessibilidade à informação, com a garantia do respeito pelos direitos, liberdades e garantias dos cidadãos.
A sugestão do relator da criação de uma rede de ANC europeias parece-me mais acertada, dado que a cooperação entre ANC nacionais activas, a fim de utilizar o pessoal e os recursos disponíveis, irá aumentar potencialmente a concorrência neste sector ao cobrir uma vasta gama de activos e diferentes mercados, permitindo assim funcionar a um nível semelhante ao das grandes ANC activas a nível mundial.
A sustentabilidade dos recursos pesqueiros constitui uma das principais preocupações da União no momento de celebrar ou alterar acordos de parceria no sector das pescas, bem como o impacto que esta actividade terá no desenvolvimento local.
A tecnologia da banda larga é seguramente uma parte importante dessa acção. A nossa nova política do espectro radioeléctrico deve garantir vastas capacidades de transmissão, bem como elevadas velocidades.
A terceira fase é nova e é composta por avaliações realizadas pelos pares.
A terceira área de preocupação é a racionalidade e eficiência no funcionamento das agências da UE, especialmente num momento de crise financeira.
A terminar, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, solicitamos que a Europa, antes de se declarar disposta a encetar negociações com vista à celebração de um acordo de comércio livre, defina com determinação os interesses comunitários que pretende proteger e especifique os domínios em que exigirá reciprocidade da parte do Japão. Esperamos que a Comissão leve em linha de conta estas nossas observações.
A terminar, tenho algumas preocupações no que respeita à protecção dos direitos de propriedade intelectual e, em particular, das indicações geográficas, questão já aqui abordada diversas vezes. A legislação indiana protege-as apenas a nível nacional, não a nível internacional.
A toxicodependência é um problema social, tanto para os países desenvolvidos como para os países subdesenvolvidos.
A transformação da ordem internacional em curso está a obrigar a União Europeia a empenhar-se mais activamente num diálogo com potências mundiais estabelecidas e emergentes, a fim de desempenhar um papel proactivo na construção de uma Organização das Nações Unidas que possa contribuir efectivamente para soluções globais, para a paz e a segurança, para a democracia e para uma ordem internacional baseada no Estado de direito.
A transição de uma instituição de ensino para a vida profissional deverá ser tão suave e harmoniosa quanto possível, devendo, em particular, ser ajustada à medida das necessidades individuais, pois deverá igualmente ser possível que os jovens com fraca formação obtenham competências que lhes permitam aceder a empregos qualificados que lhes permitam ganhar a vida. A origem social não pode ser determinante para as oportunidades de ensino de que alguém usufrui.
A transparência constitui um direito dos cidadãos e contribui para manter a credibilidade das instituições europeias: Parlamento Europeu (PE), Comissão e Conselho. O presente relatório, elaborado pelo eurodeputado Casini, versa sobre a necessidade de serem alteradas as normas do Regimento do Parlamento na sequência da criação de um registo comum em matéria de transparência entre o PE e a Comissão. O PE, após a ratificação do Tratado de Lisboa, é co-legislador em quase todos os domínios.
A transparência das actividades por parte das instituições políticas constitui um pré-requisito da sua legitimidade.
A transparência das instituições políticas é um pré-requisito da sua legitimidade e um imperativo ético. O Parlamento foi a primeira instituição europeia a tratar do fenómeno do número crescente de grupos de interesses a nível europeu e, especialmente, das consequências desta evolução para o processo legislativo.
A transparência é da maior importância, motivo por que estou extremamente preocupada por ouvir dizer que o Reino Unido não pretende comunicar os resultados dos testes de resistência e que a França não está interessada em testes de resistência ambiciosos.
A transparência é um elemento importante da democracia e um requisito para a participação dos cidadãos, constituindo assim um meio essencial para ganhar sua confiança. Além disso, a responsabilidade que resulta dos requisitos de transparência é um instrumento importante para prevenir todos os tipos de abuso.
A transparência, base da democracia, constitui um direito dos cidadãos e contribui para manter a credibilidade das instituições europeias: Parlamento Europeu (PE), Comissão e Conselho. O presente relatório, elaborado pelo eurodeputado Casini, versa sobre a conclusão de um acordo interinstitucional entre o PE e a Comissão sobre um registo comum em matéria de transparência.
A unanimidade da votação em comissão deste importante relatório e a votação de hoje demonstram, mais uma vez, que o Parlamento sabe tomar uma posição clara e decisiva em matérias fundamentais para os cidadãos e as empresas.
A velocidade e o âmbito da nossa integração com a Ucrânia, e vice-versa, irão depender do facto de a Ucrânia poder ou não garantir plenamente que respeita os direitos humanos, os princípios da democracia e os princípios do Estado de direito.
A verdade é que a resposta a este fluxo migratório, quer se deva ou não àquilo que aconteceu no Norte de África e no Mediterrâneo Sul, deverá criar legislação que envolva uma política comum relativamente ao asilo e à imigração, sobre a qual o Parlamento trabalhou e que está a ser bloqueada no Conselho.
A verdade é que esta proposta terá um impacto desproporcional sobre os Estados-Membros periféricos da União Europeia, entre os quais a Irlanda, porquanto os Estados-Membros com uma localização geográfica central têm a opção de transferir os transportes para a ferrovia. A Associação dos Exportadores Irlandeses estima que um camião que viaje da Irlanda para a Europa Continental por Holyhead e Dover terá de suportar um encargo pela utilização da estrada de 120 euros e um custo externo de 30 euros.
A verdade é que ficaram patentes as graves deficiências deste regulamento, o que torna necessário rever o enquadramento jurídico actual para definir com exactidão, entre outros, os procedimentos de gestão de crise ao dispor das autoridades competentes, para atribuir os erros ou omissões ao responsável na cadeia alimentar (e é aqui que entra a rastreabilidade), para impedir que a protecção da saúde encubra barreiras comerciais, e ainda para decidir quais os processos de indemnização por danos ao comércio e perda de lucros.
A verdade é que nem a NATO nem a ONU desejam que a UE finja envolver-se militarmente. É evidente que existe uma grande necessidade de ajuda humanitária e que a UE poderia desempenhar um papel útil, mas não de uma maneira que se destine apenas a promover uma ambição militar descabida. O problema é que a própria existência da PCSD e das suas estruturas duplicativas apenas gera controvérsia e leva os aliados a pensarem duas vezes antes de se empenharem vigorosamente em operações da NATO.
A verdade é que temos, neste Parlamento alguns "Pavlovs”: os senhores deputados Schulz, Daul e Verhofstadt, todos ausentes neste momento - fugiram em vez de intervirem aqui para centrar o orçamento na qualidade e não na quantidade, por exemplo limitando os fundos regionais e de coesão aos Estados-Membros mais pobres, economizando 30% desses fundos e investindo esses recursos em políticas orientadas para a inovação e o futuro.
A verdade é que, sem financiamento europeu para a educação a aprendizagem ao longo da vida, a fuga de cérebros para a China e os Estados Unidos irá intensificar-se. A verdade é que, sem financiamento europeu para a investigação e a inovação, os nossos países seriam menos competitivos a nível global, enquanto o crescimento e o emprego ficariam enfraquecidos. A verdade é que, sem o financiamento da política de coesão, o fosso entre regiões ricas e pobres aumentaria. A verdade é que, sem financiamento europeu, a política de segurança alimentar, a política energética e a políticas em matéria de alterações climáticas não conseguiriam cumprir as nossas expectativas e os nossos objectivos.
A verificação de que novos Estados-Membros cumprem as condições necessárias à aplicação da totalidade do acervo de Schengen é uma condição prévia à adopção da decisão do Conselho de abolição dos controlos nas fronteiras internas, após consulta do Parlamento Europeu.
A verificação de que os novos Estados-Membros cumprem as condições necessárias à aplicação de todas as partes do acervo de Schengen é uma condição prévia à adopção de uma decisão do Conselho de Ministros da UE para a abolição dos controlos nas fronteiras internas com estes países, após consulta do Parlamento Europeu.
A versão final do projecto de ordem do dia, tal como elaborado pela Conferência dos Presidentes, na sua reunião no dia 1 de Junho de 2011 e nos termos dos artigos 137.º e 138.º do Regimento, foi distribuída. Foram propostas as seguintes alterações:
A violação dos princípios e direitos fundamentais no trabalho não pode ser utilizada como uma vantagem comparativa legítima e, nas relações bilaterais e multilaterais com os nossos parceiros, temos de insistir que sejam devidamente respeitadas normas laborais dignas.
A vitória não é sinónimo de paz. São necessários tempo, esforços e sobretudo empenho e força de vontade para ultrapassar as marcas de um conflito. A reconciliação é indispensável. A justiça é essencial para um novo começo. Por conseguinte, o Governo do Sri Lanka deve iniciar imediatamente investigações às violações do direito internacional humanitário e dos direitos humanos.
A votação de hoje no Parlamento Europeu demonstrou que a Roménia está preparada para aplicar o acervo de Schengen.
A votação de ontem à noite no Parlamento grego permitiu ao Governo reunir um consenso no apoio ao pacote de reformas acordado com a União Europeia e o FMI, bem como às medidas fiscais, às privatizações e às reformas que são necessárias na caminhada da Grécia para a recuperação do crescimento.
A votação desta semana reflectirá aquilo que o Parlamento Europeu espera ver nas propostas legislativas relativas à PAC. A votação do orçamento, que está para breve, é também extremamente importante para assegurar um futuro financiamento adequado para a agricultura.
A votação expressa vem no sentido de que a designação fabricado em é essencial para a transparência dos mercados e para o devido esclarecimento dos consumidores sobre a origem dos produtos que consomem. É necessário fortalecer a economia comunitária, com a melhoria da competitividade da indústria da UE na economia mundial. Só conseguiremos ter uma concorrência justa se esta funcionar com regras claras para os produtores, para os exportadores e importadores, tendo também em atenção as premissas sociais e ambientais comuns. A codificação das regras já em vigor para as menções ou marcas que permitem identificar o lote ao qual pertence um género alimentício é o objectivo desta proposta. É, no entanto, de lamentar ainda não ser possível acompanhar o percurso do produto desde a sua origem.
A votação sobre o pacote "coesão” envia uma mensagem clara no que toca ao nosso desejo de ter uma política de coesão que mostre solidariedade e que seja eficaz e ambiciosa, já que continua a ser uma das políticas europeias mais importantes.
A votação terá lugar hoje, às 12H00.
A votação terá lugar na quarta-feira, dia 11 de Maio, às 12H30.
A votação terá lugar na quinta-feira, dia 23 de Junho de 2011.
A zona de exclusão aérea Líbia ilustra a diferença entre uma coisa e outra. A ONU intergovernamental acordou numa zona de exclusão aérea preconizada por Estados-nação como a Grã-Bretanha, a França e os Estados Unidos, enquanto outros Estados-nação como a Alemanha e a Rússia se abstiveram por razões próprias válidas. A NATO intergovernamental está agora a realizar essa operação com base numa participação voluntária.
A área do euro não foi nem passou a ser uma área monetária perfeita.
A única coisa que me preocupa é este falso sentimento de segurança. Não devíamos estar a provar a segurança de centrais nucleares: temos de investigar quais são exactamente os riscos e não dar às pessoas um falso sentimento de segurança. Precisamos de uma supervisão independente através da UE e temos de ter um regulador independente.
Abandonaremos o resultado final até Julho, e espero que a Presidência húngara, que se demonstrou tão bem-sucedida, seja capaz de chegar a um acordo que satisfaça todas as partes.
Aborda a situação em várias partes do mundo onde os países e as regiões estão em crise, como os Balcãs Ocidentais, países vizinhos da Europa Oriental, Ásia Central, Rússia, Turquia, Médio Oriente, a região do Mediterrâneo, Ásia, África e América Latina.
Abordei a questão da sobreposição de funções entre duas agências - a FEF e o CEDEFOP - na minha intervenção inicial, mas gostaria de salientar mais uma vez que a contribuição dessas agências pode ser crucial, especialmente para o aumento do emprego de acordo com os objectivos de 2020. A FEF, especialmente à luz das recentes mudanças na área do Mediterrâneo, pode desempenhar um papel muito importante, trazendo prosperidade às regiões vizinhas da União Europeia.
Abrange cidadãos que trabalhem em casas particulares, para casas particulares, e contratados através de agências de emprego.
Abrangem a simplificação, a necessidade de coordenar os financiamentos, a tentativa de desenvolver a Europa 2020, a excelência e a inovação, tendo em conta o facto de esta problemática ter duas vertentes principais: a primeira diz respeito às pequenas e médias empresas, o motor da Europa, onde temos de promover a inovação e fazê-lo através da simplificação; e a segunda são os grandes centros de investigação, que, na verdade, deviam ser em maior número.
Abrir a Europa a novos serviços e tráfego móvel aumentado cria os alicerces para novas oportunidades de cultura e conteúdos, difusores e serviços públicos na estrutura da banda larga e, em simultâneo, garante as mesmas oportunidades para a emissão.
Abrir o sector à concorrência, ou criar uma agência pública europeia, não mudará a perversidade do sistema.
Abstenho-me por consideração para com os trabalhadores belgas da fábrica da Opel em Antuérpia, que foram sacrificados em nome da sacrossanta globalização. Tendo em conta a situação a que as políticas neoliberais defendidas pela União Europeia os conduziram, poderíamos votar contra o montante irrisório que as elites europeias lhes atribuem.
Abstive-me na votação deste documento porque é necessário proceder a uma revisão profunda da política agrícola comum, que deve garantir um sistema de pagamentos directos uniforme e justo, e de muitos outros domínios importantes, sem os quais não seremos capazes de criar uma Europa competitiva e forte.
Abstive-me na votação deste relatório apesar do seu olhar crítico sobre as políticas europeias, particularmente as que são executadas pelos Estados-Membros, destinadas aos jovens.
Abstive-me na votação do presente documento porque não creio que esses dados possam ser recolhidos apenas no quadro das contas do ambiente. É essencial assegurar a cooperação de todos os Estados-Membros e uma plena harmonização ao nível da UE.
Abstive-me na votação, porque acho que não houve qualquer discussão sobre a forma de promover o reconhecimento mútuo das qualificações obtidas através de métodos de educação e formação qualitativamente diferentes.
Abstive-me nesta votação. Apoiei o relatório Ferreira que o acompanha, mas não pude apoiar este relatório porque me oponho veementemente ao programa de medidas de austeridade paralisadoras que está a ser introduzido na União Europeia pelo centro-direita.
Abstive-me porque, no caso da Catalunha, a proposta resultaria na penalização de um vasto número de pequenas e médias empresas, que não podem colocar bens e produtos em comboios (em particular, por causa da diferença de bitola, que constitui um obstáculo físico à realização do mercado interno) e cujos negócios sairiam grandemente lesados.
Abstivemo-nos nesta votação. Além disso, apresentámos uma resolução alternativa em que pretendíamos clarificar o papel das avaliações de impacto e dos peritos externos no processo de avaliação de impacto.
Acabei de olhar para o meu telemóvel para ver quanto me custa.
Acabo de receber a notícia de que, à margem desta sessão plenária, o Conselho concordou na única questão em aberto relativamente à Frontex, pelo que as negociações sobre o reforço desta agência foram concluídas com êxito.
Acabámos por nos abster em virtude de terem sido adoptadas várias alterações propostas pelo PPE e pelo ECR, inadmissíveis para nós.
Aceitará, antes de mais, que este não é apenas um debate alemão e que há outros elementos nesta discussão? Porque pareceu bastante que esta seria uma discussão interna alemã, e há diferentes pontos de vista a este respeito.
Achamos também crucial, como disse a senhora deputada Fraga Estévez, verificar-se se os Estados-Membros estão a usar todos os fundos actualmente previstos pelo regulamento.
Acho por isso essencial arranjar soluções para estreitar este distanciamento e assim mostrar que a União Europeia tem como principal fim o bem-estar dos cidadãos europeus.
Acho que estas avaliações de impacto devem mostrar quem são realmente os responsáveis e onde reside a culpa, porque é muito conveniente não assumir responsabilidades.
Acho que quando nós chegamos à idade adulta apreciamos os argumentos racionais e, se formos adultos bem formados, apreciamos os julgamentos racionais que são justos. E, para ser justos, não podemos contemporizar com double standards.
Acima das opiniões contrárias de economistas e das numerosas opiniões de deputados deste Parlamento, deve ficar claro que a Grécia não pode sair da zona euro por razões jurídicas.
Acima de tudo, como referiram muitos oradores anteriores, necessitamos que todos os Estados-Membros realizem uma análise da situação actual, no interesse dos animais, da agricultura europeia e, sobretudo, dos cidadãos da União Europeia.
Acima de tudo, considera-se a necessidade de incentivos para estimular a sustentabilidade, e não apenas taxas mais elevadas. A disposição que prevê taxas mais elevadas nas horas de ponta, compensadas pelo período de tempo de menor tráfego, está agora muito mais bem elaborada do que na posição do Conselho.
Acima de tudo, este regulamento deve exigir a indicação de partes não têxteis de origem animal na marcação e etiquetagem de produtos têxteis, para que os consumidores possam fazer uma escolha com base na informação que têm em seu poder. A etiquetagem e marcação não deve ser enganosa e deve ser fornecida de modo a que o consumidor compreenda facilmente a que parte do produto as indicações se referem.
Acima de tudo, estes aspectos devem ser estabelecidos de tal forma que, não sendo cumpridos, haja consequências. Não quero com isto parecer que estou a assumir uma atitude doutoral em relação aos nossos amigos indianos.
Acima de tudo, gostaria de felicitar a Hungria e a sua nova Constituição. O facto de a esmagadora maioria dos cidadãos húngaros apoiar a nova legislação é particularmente impressionante e demonstra que a nação húngara se afastou completamente da tradição das Constituições comunistas, em que tinha sido redigida a Constituição anterior.
Acima de tudo, necessitamos de soluções conjuntas e mais eficazes para proteger as fronteiras externas da UE e de normas uniformes para todos os EstadosMembros no que diz respeito à política de imigração. Neste contexto, insto a Comissão Europeia a manter a sua oposição resoluta à reintrodução dos controlos nas fronteiras ou a estabelecer regras, critérios e mecanismos conjuntos, uniformes e razoáveis para uma possível reintrodução.
Acima de tudo, o senhor mencionou tudo aquilo que espera fazer em termos de desenvolvimento, de acção humanitária, o facto de que tem de ser feita justiça e de que não podemos trair o Tribunal Penal Internacional.
Acima de tudo, qualquer novo sistema de financiamento do orçamento não deve aumentar o encargo sobre os tesouros nacionais ou a carga fiscal dos cidadãos. Para reduzir o descontentamento dos cidadãos da UE com a despesa actual, é necessário melhorar a qualidade da implementação e da aplicação da despesa.
Acima de tudo, saúdo o facto de que aquando da aplicação deste regulamento sobre a dívida pública, a Comissão deverá ter em conta "todos os demais factores relevantes", em particular, a dívida privada e outros factores importantes que permitam uma avaliação global.
Acima de tudo, tenho a sensação de que as opiniões políticas continuam a prevalecer sobre as económicas, como se fosse possível ludibriar os mercados com umas quantas promessas e esquivarmo-nos à necessidade de encontrar uma solução real para a situação.
Acolhi com satisfação este presente documento porque, na viragem do século, a UE mudou de uma estratégia vinculatória em matéria de dimensão externa da política social para uma abordagem não vinculatória, isto é, deixou de procurar vincular as normas sociais aos acordos comerciais para passar a concentrar-se na cooperação e no diálogo internacionais. A UE utiliza diferentes tipos de instrumentos para aplicar a política social em países terceiros.
Acolhi favoravelmente este documento porque a Europa tem de agir de imediato, sobretudo no que respeita aos jovens: o aumento do desemprego dos jovens é um dos desafios mais prementes da Europa. E não é apenas o facto de a taxa de desemprego dos jovens ser mais elevada que a dos trabalhadores adultos: os jovens ocupam também mais empregos precários e temporários, com salários mais baixos e menos segurança social.
Acolhi favoravelmente este relatório porque é uma resposta à comunicação da Comissão sobre o exame intercalar dos sistemas mundiais de navegação por satélite (GNSS) europeus autónomos (Galileu e EGNOS), que avalia o processo e a implementação até à data e lança um debate sobre a sua governação, a sua exploração e o seu financiamento futuros. A UE decidiu criar o seu próprio sistema mundial de navegação por satélite por duas razões principais: em primeiro lugar, assegurar a independência e a autonomia da Europa em relação a outros sistemas globais de navegação e, em segundo lugar, conquistar uma quota deste mercado mundial de alta tecnologia em rápido crescimento, que hoje é dominado, em grande medida, pelos EUA.
Acolhi favoravelmente este relatório, uma vez que as avaliações de impacto (AI) são um instrumento central do processo legislativo de que a autoridade legislativa europeia se deve servir mais intensivamente no futuro.
Acolhi favoravelmente o relatório porque o ano de 2011 é um momento estratégico para retirar ensinamentos dos quatro anos de vigência do Regulamento (CE) n.º 1905/2006 que institui um instrumento de financiamento da cooperação para o desenvolvimento (ICD). A finalidade deste relatório é definir, numa fase inicial, a posição do Parlamento em relação a um novo instrumento financeiro da cooperação da UE para o desenvolvimento, baseada nos ensinamentos retirados do nosso controlo da aplicação do ICD.
Acolho com agrado a proposta de que a responsabilidade civil das ANC em caso de negligência grave ou dolo seja definida consistentemente em toda a UE. Além disso, é necessário aumentar as responsabilidades, a capacidade, os poderes e os recursos dos supervisores para o controlo, a avaliação e a supervisão da adequação dos modelos internos e para a imposição de medidas prudenciais, bem como para realizar investigações e inspecções. É muito importante criar condições de concorrência equitativas através do fomento da concorrência, da transparência, da abertura dos mercados e da estabilidade.
Acolho com agrado o facto de, ao abrigo desta Agenda Urbana, a questão da definição do conceito de "urbano” ser deixada a cargo dos Estados-Membros, em conformidade com o princípio da subsidiariedade.
Acompanharemos de perto o debate sobre a aplicação das normas laborais consagradas na Convenção da OIT, e gostaria de salientar que a Comissão se congratula com a ênfase na proposta de hoje para uma resolução sobre a necessidade da UE promover as normas laborais fundamentais da OIT e a agenda do trabalho digno em todo o mundo, incluindo a igualdade de género e a não discriminação política como uma questão transversal.
Acompanho a relatora, no seguimento do seu relatório inicial, em que o regulamento relativo ao transporte profissional de notas e moedas de euro seja alargado ao território dos Estados-Membros que estão em vias de aderir à zona euro.
Acompanho o convite do relator à Vice-Presidente da Comissão e Alta Representante da União para os Assuntos Externos e a Política de Segurança e ao Presidente do Conselho Europeu para que tomem medidas para que o reforço dos direitos de observador da União Europeia se torne uma prioridade estratégica e mostrem uma maior visibilidade nas Nações Unidas mediante a intensificação das consultas com os governos dos países terceiros membros das Nações Unidas.
Acompanhámos também a preocupação do relator em relação ao problema da pirataria no Oceano Índico, que afecta cada vez mais a pesca atuneira.
Aconteceu no passado nós, no Reino Unido, sermos vítimas deste clima de medo quanto aos nossos produtos, e estas acusações ao acaso têm de parar.
Acontecimentos recentes ocorridos na região estão a suscitar preocupações no que diz respeito ao cumprimento dos termos do recente referendo sobre a independência do Sudão do Sul, ao mesmo tempo que a escalada da violência em Abyei, que ameaça causar desestabilização geral na zona, constitui um acontecimento negativo. A União Africana tem um papel importante a desempenhar devendo, com a ajuda da UE e da ONU, manter os olhos abertos nesta época crítica, de molde a evitar o regresso aos conflitos armados.
Acontecimentos recentes vieram mostrar que os diferentes Pactos de Estabilidade e Crescimento não resultaram como o pretendido, tendo entretanto vários Estados-Membros enfrentado graves problemas em cumprir as suas obrigações e arriscado aumentar a sua dívida pública. O documento hoje aprovado em plenário integra um pacote de medidas mais alargado que constituem as propostas da Governação Económica Europeia.
Acordo Interinstitucional sobre um registo comum em matéria de transparência - Alteração das normas na sequência da criação de um registo comum em matéria de transparência
Acordo entre a CE e o Canadá em matéria de segurança da aviação civil (
Acordos que, longe de estimularem a (na prática) inexistente responsabilidade social das empresas, apenas protegem os lucros dos grupos económicos e financeiros e não dão a atenção devida aos direitos laborais, à importância da negociação colectiva e da livre associação dos trabalhadores, à eliminação efectiva da discriminação em matéria de emprego, à eliminação do trabalho forçado, do trabalho precário e mal pago, do trabalho infantil.
Acordámos um quadro conjunto com os EUA, que serve de base para a libertação e a admissão de alguns dos antigos prisioneiros nos Estados-Membros da UE. Continuamos preparados para cooperar com os Estados Unidos noutras medidas que levem ao encerramento do campo de detenção.
Acreditam que os défices são sobretudo produto de más intenções por parte desses Estados, como se o modelo neoliberal que nunca questionam não tivesse acabado de passar pela pior crise desde 1929, e como se não estivesse já a criar pressão sobre o poder de compra dos cidadãos comuns e a causar uma enorme contracção da receita fiscal: dois problemas que estiveram na base do aumento do endividamento privado e público.
Acreditamos firmemente que podemos tirar melhor partido da cooperação entre empresários do sector cultural, por um lado, e o ensino superior - universidades e outros estabelecimentos de ensino superior - e o ensino secundário, por outro, e ainda que estes sectores oferecem muito mais oportunidades do que temos sabido aproveitar.
Acreditamos na Europa, acreditamos nas suas políticas e na necessidade de as financiar, porque, Senhor Comissário, a UE não é uma despesa, mas sim um valor acrescentado para as políticas nacionais.
Acreditamos que a aplicação da supervisão orçamental deverá estar sempre sujeita aos objectivos primordiais da UE e, em particular, aos requisitos relacionados com a promoção de um elevado nível de emprego, com a garantia de protecção social adequada e com o combate à exclusão social.
Acreditamos que a mensagem do Parlamento Europeu actuará como uma linha orientadora e que será conseguida unanimidade no Conselho para que possa ser tomada uma decisão final.
Acreditamos que as alterações aprovadas pela Comissão do Comércio Internacional constituem a base para encontrar esta solução. Mantêm a confiança fundamental na proposta da Comissão mas, ao mesmo tempo, procuram um potencial compromisso.
Acreditamos que os requisitos atinentes aos quadros orçamentais nacionais devem garantir não só que o planeamento orçamental dos Estados-Membros assente em previsões realistas, mas também garantir que seja dispensada a devida atenção à sustentabilidade dos respectivos sistemas de protecção social, incluindo os sistemas de pensões e os sistemas de cuidados de saúde.
Acreditamos que se trata de uma medida de emergência e pensamos que medidas de flexibilidade a curto prazo podiam, de momento, fazer respirar de alívio um sector que tem sido bem duramente atingido.
Acreditarei em si, Senhor Deputado Posselt, quando diz que subscreve estes princípios e pretende que apliquemos os direitos humanos em todo o lado - tanto na União Europeia como na Ucrânia -, se apresentar também uma resolução do mesmo tipo sobre a Bulgária, onde primeiros-ministros e antigos ministros estão a ser investigados na sequência de acusações absurdas.
Acredito ainda que o número de falhas ou erros é relativamente pequeno - apesar de continuarem a ser demasiados. Não podemos agora atirar fora o bebé juntamente com a água do banho, que é o que alguns colegas nesta Assembleia gostariam de fazer.
Acredito e espero que todos nós sintamos que estamos a atravessar tempos históricos e que o epílogo não será redigido em cores sombrias para o futuro da União Europeia e da UEM, antes marcará um passo decisivo e corajoso no sentido de uma Europa mais coesa, mais unida e, inclusivamente, mais forte.
Acredito especialmente na necessidade de formar as novas gerações e acredito em profissionais jovens e altamente qualificados, capazes de enfrentar os desafios colocados pelo novo mercado global.
Acredito firmemente que o alargamento do registo se revelará igualmente uma inspiração para o Parlamento da República Checa. A introdução de um registo na República Checa seria uma contribuição decisiva para o desenvolvimento da política checa.
Acredito firmemente que é no interesse de ambas as partes cooperar neste domínio, e não menos importante demonstrar aos cidadãos da Europa que estamos a cooperar.
Acredito na capacidade deste programa para criar as condições necessárias à competitividade bem sucedida com os mercados de novas tecnologias da China e dos Estados Unidos da América, bem como para manter a liderança europeia na indústria das telecomunicações.
Acredito no impacto positivo que o seu desenvolvimento poderá ter tanto a nível económico (em termos de criação de emprego e de contribuição para o PIB) como a nível social (sob a forma de integração social e cultural dos cidadãos). Desta forma, louvo o apoio visado para o sector da criação, pois penso ser este o caminho certo para um crescimento duradouro e sustentável da economia europeia, face à conjuntura mundial apresentada nos nossos dias. A inovação, a coesão estrutural e a criação de novos produtos e serviços devem ser uma prioridade tida em conta na construção de qualquer política europeia.
Acredito numa Europa forte que revela solidariedade e sou um dos que apoiam a perspectiva promovida pela Presidência húngara da UE, expressa no slogan "Uma Europa forte". Contudo, perante os recentes acontecimentos relativos ao futuro do espaço Shengen, devo dizer que estamos no caminho errado.
Acredito que a China empregue actualmente vice-ministros adicionais apenas para receber os todo-poderosos ministros europeus que chegam para pedir favores e acordos bilaterais a Pequim.
Acredito que com tudo aquilo que agora alcançamos, a União estará cada vez mais preparada para, de uma forma unida, coordenar e prevenir eventuais problemas, deficiências ou desequilíbrios.
Acredito que deveremos prosseguir as negociações com o Conselho, para que este se associe ao Registo de Transparência e para que este registo se torne comum às três Instituições.
Acredito que esta solução significa que poderemos também sentir-nos seguros no futuro no que respeita à área do euro e à possibilidade de resolver, num determinado país, problemas económicos que, se não fossem enfrentados, poderiam resultar numa situação de risco para toda a área do euro.
Acredito que este sistema de medição, que tem por base a corroboração de diferentes parâmetros de estudo, induzirá decisões políticas mais adequadas às necessidades da sociedade e da economia em geral.
Acredito que o facto de virmos a realizar um teste de stress a nível europeu com critérios comuns constitui um passo em frente extremamente importante e histórico, a bem da segurança de todos os cidadãos europeus.
Acredito que o que comemos é importante para todos nós e que o tipo de alimentos com que crescem os nossos filhos e netos é ainda mais importante.
Acredito que o sector da aeronáutica pode tornar-se um modelo de cooperação entre a UE e o Japão.
Acredito que os objectivos do Parlamento e do Conselho são os mesmos, nomeadamente reforçar a governação económica da UE e da área do euro, evitar futuras crises e criar um quadro único para a governação económica na área do euro e no conjunto da UE.
Acredito que os valores que caracterizam a acção do PE, nomeadamente a promoção da democracia e a defesa dos direitos do Homem, podem contribuir positivamente para a construção de uma ferramenta mais densa, eficaz e abrangente. A forma como o relatório analisa esta questão é, na minha opinião, bastante interessante, propondo novas abordagens que terão agora que ser discutidas ao longo dos próximos meses, nomeadamente no que diz respeito à necessidade de uma ajuda mais diferenciada aos países em desenvolvimento, dividindo-os por grupos.
Acredito que uma política comum de espectro de radiofrequências proporcionará aos Estados-Membros da União Europeia novas possibilidades para desenvolver as indústrias da informação e da tecnologia das comunicações. As empresas, pela sua parte, terão a oportunidade de oferecer novos serviços de qualidade, o que estimulará o desenvolvimento da economia comum europeia. Não obstante, ao fazer alterações na política do espectro de radiofrequências, devemos igualmente ter em conta os acordos internacionais relativos à libertação de diferentes frequências a nível internacional.
Acredito que é aqui que reside a grande força da proposta em questão. A proposta exorta os EstadosMembros a garantirem níveis de segurança mais elevados, que respeitem igualmente as normas internacionais de segurança; uma maior atenção aos progressos técnicos e científicos, em particular com vista a respeitar o princípio da reversibilidade; e uma maior ênfase na protecção do ambiente e da saúde pública.
Acredito que é do nosso interesse enquanto Europeus, enquanto cidadãos europeus, que os Estados-Membros ajam concertadamente na esfera das relações externas. É evidente que, na Europa de hoje, nem os maiores Estados-Membros têm a influência ou o poder necessários para liderem em pé de igualdade com os Estados Unidos ou a China e outras potências, mas, agindo de forma concertada, a União Europeia pode fazer a diferença. Assim, espero que o processo conduza a uma convergência acrescida entre os nossos Estados-Membros também no plano dos assuntos externos.
Acredito ser necessária uma abordagem verdadeiramente europeia de longo prazo, que leve a uma utilização partilhada de tecnologia, à economia de recursos e a mecanismos de financiamento europeu. A adopção de uma abordagem global e a divulgação de informações relevantes permitirá que os cidadãos europeus ganhem confiança e tranquilidade.
Acredito sinceramente que estamos todos convictos de uma coisa: é preciso evitar toda a escalada de violência, porque esta poderia provocar a ocorrência de novas vítimas. A situação de segurança deve ser resolvida em conformidade com os acordos de Kadugli e Abyei do início deste ano, incluindo, em meu entender, a intervenção de uma força de segurança mista patrocinada pela ONU.
Acredito sinceramente que uma campanha deste tipo poderia não só ajudar a prevenir a doença mas também ajudar os produtores de produtos hortícolas.
Acredito, por isso, que este relatório é uma contribuição bastante válida para o desenvolvimento do sistema de comércio internacional, que assenta em relações laborais tão díspares entre diferentes países/blocos comerciais.
Acresce ainda que esta agenda do ACL e a sua tentativa de fazer aplicar os direitos de propriedade intelectual e a exclusividade dos dados põem em risco o acesso a medicamentos genéricos baratos que são produzidos na Índia.
Acresce que a UE possui importantes experiências para partilhar quando é necessário superar conflitos e criar estabilidade através do interesse comum e da compreensão mútua.
Acresce que a Índia também é aliada da União no quadro das negociações multilaterais sobre as indicações geográficas na Ronda de Doha.
Acresce que o naipe de dados ambientais actualmente disponível deve ser alargado a médio prazo, a fim de facilitar a necessária avaliação da política ambiental europeia.
Acresce que, na altura, o Parlamento propôs a negociação de um código de conduta para lobistas e a discussão das sanções que seriam aplicáveis em caso da sua violação.
Acrescentem-se os vários registos históricos dos impérios da Europa, e concluiu-se que a democracia é o alicerce imprescindível para o progresso humano.
Actualizámos também a despesa relacionada com o Tratado de Lisboa, que aumentou em 4%. Esta é a primeira parte da resposta.
Actualmente estamos a examinar quatro agências que reflectem os problemas fundamentais de todas as agências, ou seja, a sobreposição de responsabilidades, por exemplo, entre a Agência Europeia para a Segurança e Saúde (OSHA) e a Fundação Europeia para a Melhoria das Condições de Vida e de Trabalho (Eurofound), e entre a OSHA e a Agência Europeia da Segurança Marítima (AESM), a Agência Ferroviária Europeia (AFE) e a Agência Europeia para a Segurança da Aviação (AESA). Há também uma sobreposição significativa entre a Fundação Europeia para a Formação (FEF) e o Centro Europeu para o Desenvolvimento da Formação Profissional (CEDEFOP). Face aos problemas financeiros da Europa, por que razão não conseguimos tomar algumas medidas fundamentais nesta área e fundir as agências com funções muito semelhantes, como a agência responsável pela formação profissional dentro da Europa e a agência para a formação profissional fora da Europa?
Actualmente, 14,4% dos jovens da Europa com idades entre os 18 e os 24 anos têm menos do que o ensino secundário, e quase 21% dos jovens estão desempregados.
Actualmente, 42% da superfície da UE é coberta por floresta e demais áreas arborizadas, sendo que a floresta representa 2 milhões de empregos, sobretudo em PME, e um volume de negócios de 300 mil milhões de euros.
Actualmente, a Europa está a ficar para trás relativamente aos EUA e à China, que estão a libertar grandes partes do espectro para permitir o rápido desenvolvimento de novos serviços e da Internet móvel de alta velocidade.
Actualmente, a Europa está a ficar para trás, enquanto os EUA e a China estão a libertar grandes partes do espectro, a fim de permitir o rápido desenvolvimento de novos serviços e da Internet móvel de alta velocidade. O nosso objectivo deve ser fazer o que é melhor para a Europa: libertar o espectro para novos serviços e maior tráfego móvel, abrir novas oportunidades para cultura e conteúdo, para organismos de radiodifusão e serviços públicos no quadro da banda larga e, ao mesmo tempo, assegurar aos organismos de radiodifusão as mesmas oportunidades de que gozam hoje. A banda larga sem fios é essencial para garantir que serviços novos e inovadores estejam disponíveis para todos os cidadãos. Parece óbvio que este objectivo não pode ser alcançado através da utilização da fibra óptica, cuja instalação requer um investimento considerável, mas através da utilização de uma mistura de tecnologias sem fios disponíveis para alargar a cobertura por banda larga (radiocomunicações terrestres, cabo, fibra ou sistemas de satélite) para cobrir todo o território da Comunidade, incluindo zonas rurais e periféricas, permitindo ao mercado escolher a tecnologia mais eficiente do ponto de vista do custo para operadores e cidadãos.
Actualmente, a Finlândia não mostra tencionar aprovar o pacote português. Estes assuntos têm consequências recíprocas, e é por isso que tento explicar aqui que, se não estivermos agora preparados para fazer mudanças, a opinião pública não nos apoiará e ficaremos a perder no que respeita às questões mais significativas e fundamentais.
Actualmente, a discussão é sempre polarizada: ou natureza ou postos de trabalho. Nós, políticos, infelizmente temos utilizado também este tipo de argumento.
Actualmente, a livre circulação é garantida num território com 42 673 km de fronteiras marítimas externas e 7 721 km de fronteiras terrestres, abrangendo 25 países e 400 milhões de cidadãos. Neste momento, a Bulgária, a Roménia e Chipre só aplicam parcialmente o acervo de Schengen, pelo que continuam a ser efectuados controlos nas fronteiras com esses três Estados-Membros. A Roménia e a Bulgária adoptaram o acervo de Schengen com a sua adesão à União Europeia, em 2007.
Actualmente, as telecomunicações são tão importantes como as comunicações normais, tanto para as pessoas como para as empresas.
Actualmente, demasiados jovens abandonam o ensino muito cedo e são insuficientes os que tiram partido do ensino superior.
Actualmente, dois terços dos recursos energéticos são importados de países de fora da UE, sobretudo a Rússia.
Actualmente, este espaço é composto por 25 Estados participantes. A Roménia e a Bulgária devem juntar-se a este círculo em breve - é pelo menos esse o meu desejo.
Actualmente, está a dar-se atenção principalmente à implementação do Plano de Acção da UE para o período de 2009-2012, que se destina ao reforço da cooperação europeia na luta contra as consequências inaceitáveis da toxicodependência.
Actualmente, existem países onde observamos tendências exactamente opostas: diminuição da idade limite da escolaridade obrigatória e redução do número de estabelecimentos de ensino superior público.
Actualmente, mais de 1 700 organizações possuem acreditação como grupo de interesses junto do Parlamento Europeu, e 3 900 junto da Comissão. Para poder tomar posição de forma válida sobre um tema de natureza técnica, é normal informarmo-nos junto das pessoas que estão a par destas matérias.
Actualmente, na sequência do inesperado acordo de reconciliação entre a Fatah e o Hamas, que prevê o estabelecimento de um governo técnico, não partidário e interino, bem como a realização de eleições antecipadas, a Europa deve aproveitar esta oportunidade para desempenhar um papel positivo na região. Pode fazê-lo colaborando com o governo interino que será formado nos próximos dias; apoiando a realização de eleições antecipadas; e, mais importante ainda, comprometendo-se a respeitar na íntegra o resultado das eleições e a trabalhar com a nova administração que resultar das eleições. A Europa não pode, por um lado, colaborar com os movimentos democráticos na Líbia, Síria, Tunísia e Egipto, e recusar-se a fazê-lo com um governo eleito democraticamente pelo povo palestiniano. A resposta inicial de Israel à reconciliação, retendo os impostos devidos à Autoridade Palestina (AP), é ilegal e potencialmente catastrófica para a paz, pondo em risco os esforços do Primeiro-Ministro Salem Fayyad para a construção do Estado. A UE deve intervir no sentido de cobrir integralmente a perda dessa receita, deixando simultaneamente claro que devemos recuperar esse dinheiro, congelando uma verba de igual valor do dinheiro devido a Israel pela UE, até que este país pare com mais esta violação do direito internacional.
Actualmente, num momento em que há mais de 23 milhões de desempregados, a política de coesão é uma das políticas que pode também contribuir para a criação de novos postos de trabalho. É possível que não haja um único eurodeputado que duvide da necessidade de prolongar a política de coesão após 2013. A questão da utilização eficiente de fundos, da transparência e da melhoria do processo global, e do retorno do investimento está na ordem do dia.
Actualmente, não é isso que acontece e, nesse sentido, é muito importante que seja agora efectuada uma revisão no que respeita às PME.
Actualmente, o mundo vive um processo de grande crescimento em termos de globalização, sobretudo com as revoluções e transição para a democracia de países tradicionalmente fechados e governados por regimes totalitários, o que constitui um conjunto de oportunidades que a UE não deve descurar.
Actualmente, o quadro regulamentar europeu é um modelo para outras jurisdições. Todavia, os desenvolvimentos nos mercados europeus na sequência da crise da dívida soberana na Primavera de 2010 deixaram claro que são necessários uma revisão e um reforço. Por esta razão, a Comissão comprometeu-se em Junho de 2010 a analisar os temas em profundidade.
Actualmente, o sector florestal emprega dois milhões de pessoas na UE, principalmente em pequenas e médias empresas, e gera um volume de negócios anual de 300 mil milhões de euros.
Actualmente, os Estados-Membros estão a enfrentar uma crise económica, financeira e social, a criar a necessidade, mais do que nunca, de solidariedade e respeito pelos princípios fundamentais da União. Apelo à eliminação das barreiras à livre circulação dos trabalhadores da Roménia e da Bulgária.
Actualmente, os contratos de cariz internacional são redigidos com base no direito internacional privado e, ao nível da UE, com base no Regulamento (CE) n.º 593/2008.
Actualmente, possui imagens de marca mundialmente reconhecidas como O Violinista de Sarajevo que, vestido de negro e no meio dos destroços da guerra, deambula pelas ruas procurando atenuar o sofrimento de um povo martirizado que não pôde abandonar a cidade.
Actualmente, sob a égide do 7º Programa-quadro Euratom, estamos a apoiar uma rede de excelência em radioecologia para financiarmos a integração, uma rede de excelência e excelência científica no interesse da protecção dos seres humanos e do ambiente.
Actualmente, são oito as convenções da Organização Internacional do Trabalho (OIT) ratificadas por todos os Estados-Membros da UE. Essas convenções devem levar à criação de uma base de normas internacionais partilhadas pelos Estados-Membros.
Actualmente, temos de importar um grande número de trabalhadores de outros países para desempenharem funções que requerem uma determinada especialização, tal como médicos e enfermeiros. São estes os problemas que a União Europeia está a enfrentar e, portanto, temos de avaliar a eficácia das medidas destas agências.
Actualmente, testemunhamos amiúde na Grécia, em Portugal e na Irlanda que, sob pressão da Comissão Europeia, nas negociações com os Governos nacionais foram associados resultados e pacotes de medidas que resultam em que são os mais vulneráveis a sofrer, e os ricos - que lucraram muito nos últimos 20 anos - não são afectados.
Actualmente, vocês coordenam essas coisas com a Comissão, e isso não acontecia no passado.
Actualmente, é difícil imaginar como seria a nossa região sem o apoio da UE. É pena que haja falta de informação acerca dos efeitos específicos da utilização deste dinheiro, pois, na realidade, é a avaliação da forma como toda uma região utilizou uma variedade de programas, e não a avaliação de programas individuais, que deveria sugerir o caminho que a política de coesão deveria seguir nos próximos anos.
Acusações infundadas, improvisação, falta de coordenação, prejuízos de muitos milhões, ataques à honra e à credibilidade de um sector: não serão estas razões suficientes para exigir responsabilidades?
Ademais, acrescenta que estas políticas devem ter especial incidência no desenvolvimento e reforço do mercado único, ou seja: mais políticas neoliberais, mais privatizações, mais livre concorrência, mais políticas que favorecem os mais fortes à custa dos mais fracos. O relatório insiste no pagamento de multas pelos Estados que não cumpram as exigências que lhes são impostas pelo PEC reforçado, embora, para dar cobertura ao sistema de sanções, procure também incluir um sistema de incentivos.
Ademais, temos salientado a importância de promover o investimento em serviços públicos, apoiar a produção, a criação de emprego com direitos, a erradicação da pobreza e o combate às desigualdades sociais.
Adiada fica uma reivindicação antiga do sector e dos consumidores, objecto já de resoluções deste Parlamento (a última, de 2010): a indicação do país de origem e a disponibilização de informação sobre a origem das várias mercadorias, o que lamentamos.
Adicionalmente a estas diferenças ao nível do direito dos contratos, há também outros obstáculos que impedem as transacções transfronteiriças, e que têm a ver com domínios como questões fiscais, propriedade intelectual ou a disponibilidade de métodos de pagamento electrónico.
Adicionalmente à ajuda prestada a estes países pela UE, as instituições estão a trabalhar no sentido de reforçar o Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento com vista a evitar crises deste tipo no futuro. É este o objectivo do pacote relativo à governação económica, do qual faz parte este relatório da minha colega, senhora deputada Goulard. O relatório trata da supervisão orçamental na área do euro.
Adicionalmente à ajuda prestada a estes países pela UE, as instituições estão a trabalhar no sentido de reforçar o Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento com vista a evitar crises deste tipo no futuro. É este o objectivo do pacote relativo à governação económica, do qual faz parte este relatório da minha colega, senhora deputada Wortmann-Kool. O presente relatório trata da supervisão das situações orçamentais e da supervisão e coordenação das políticas económicas O debate referente ao presente relatório incidiu sobre a questão do mecanismo de votação invertida por maioria qualificada - o que significa que as recomendações da Comissão entrarão em vigor a menos que o Conselho se lhes oponha por maioria qualificada - e também sobre a cláusula de revisão. Durante a votação, dei o meu apoio a estes dois mecanismos, pois estou convencida de que temos de ser exigentes e ambiciosos, para melhorar a estabilidade orçamental na Europa e, deste modo, salvaguardarmos o nosso futuro.
Adiámos a quitação, porque é óbvio que a EMEA está a ter problemas com os procedimentos de adjudicação de contratos.
Admiram a Europa Ocidental como um espaço cujos padrões desejam absolutamente alcançar. Virar-lhes as costas agora poderia levar muitos romenos a tornarem-se eurocépticos". Isso é algo que não queremos, nem para a Roménia, nem para a Bulgária.
Admito que sim, mas isto é obviamente tão importante, e é uma questão tão urgente, que a fuga da reunião da semana passada foi discutida no Hemiciclo.
Adoptou a abordagem correcta, e podemos ter certeza de que o Parlamento e a Comissão serão muito bem sucedidos.
Adrian Severin, ex-vice-primeiro-ministro da Roménia, foi suspenso do Partido Social Democrata do seu país natal depois de ter vindo a lume o escândalo de corrupção no Parlamento Europeu, no qual esteve envolvido.
Afigura-se adequado que a Comissão providencie mais recursos para a protecção das fronteiras externas, mas, ao mesmo tempo, é conveniente que o Fundo Europeu para os Refugiados e os recursos financeiros destinados à integração também sejam aumentados. A aplicação global da Carta dos Direitos Fundamentais e o reforço da dimensão dos direitos humanos na UE são do interesse de todos os cidadãos da União. Face ao aumento das situações de discriminação e à contínua propagação da intolerância, que são preocupações comuns em toda a Europa, considero muito importante garantir a expansão de programas de promoção do respeito dos direitos fundamentais, assim como o reforço da cidadania da UE.
Afigura-se que apenas querem trabalhar num espírito de compromisso quando estão em causa os seus relatórios.
Afinal de contas, essa negociação só serviria para restringir esse direito. Não vejo por que razão, na qualidade de deputado ao Parlamento Europeu, alguma vez eu estaria disposto a dar esse passo.
Afinal de contas, é muito raro uma situação de dificuldade tão persistente para se chegar a um acordo no Conselho - e, Senhora Presidente, não estou a culpar a Presidência húngara do Conselho, que fez o seu melhor.
Afinal, alguém tem de passar da teoria à prática.
Afinal, conforme observou o Senhor Comissário, as diferentes peças individuais de legislação - a legislação relativa à água, a legislação em matéria de resíduos e a referente à qualidade do ar - já impõem a obrigação de coligir estes dados.
Afinal, falamos de um país que, à semelhança de todos os países da União, é membro do Conselho da Europa e pertence à Parceria Oriental da UE.
Afinal, muitas pessoas estão desiludidas por não sermos capazes de discutir também uma nova forma de afectar os fundos existentes.
Afinal, o seu papel primário é produzir alimentos. O relatório propõe igualmente medidas para incentivar os jovens agricultores que, como sabemos, enfrentam muitas dificuldades para se lançar na carreira.
Afinal, os acontecimentos no Norte de África demonstram que para se conseguir realizar uma reforma eficaz, é necessária a participação activa da sociedade civil. O governo russo deve, portanto, trabalhar para que tal aconteça no seu país e tentar estabelecer uma parceria para a modernização com a sociedade civil.
Afinal, quando a senhora baronesa foi líder da Câmara dos Lordes do Reino Unido e promoveu a aprovação do Tratado de Lisboa, que criou o seu cargo de 313 000 libras por ano, ouvi-a dizer repetidas vezes que se tratava apenas de pôr a casa em ordem e não de uma transferência significativa de soberania.
Afinal, recordamo-nos que, em todas as discussões mantidas pelas Troikas que se deslocam aos vários países que estamos a tentar ajudar, é em última instância o FMI - e quase me dói dizer isto depois de tudo o que os gregos disseram sobre o FMI nas décadas de 1980 e 1990 - que é hoje o mais razoável, enquanto a Comissão e o Banco Central Europeu são os que estabelecem as condições mais duras.
Afinal, é do interesse dos Estados-Membros mais atrasados relativamente à excelência da investigação comunitária aproveitarem os recursos dos Fundos Estruturais europeus para reforçarem os seus sectores científicos e de investigação. Esta oportunidade deve ser disponibilizada nas próximas perspectivas financeiras.
Afirmou ser necessário que ele possa disponibilizar linhas de crédito flexíveis aos países.
Agenda urbana europeia e sua futura política de coesão (
Agora dizem que é por causa da crise, mas também pretendiam reduções quando as actuais perspectivas financeiras foram negociadas. É por isso que pedimos ao Conselho que, se não concorda com este reforço do orçamento, nos indique que objectivos não quer ver cumpridos.
Agora estamos numa situação em que abdicamos da moeda ou tentamos construir alguma forma de governação económica capaz de fortalecer os seus alicerces e, de certo modo, reconstruir a infra-estrutura.
Agora fará parte também da Rede Europeia de Informação sobre a Droga e a Toxicodependência.
Agora precisamos de acção, e eu sei muito bem que a senhora Comissária Máire Geoghegan-Quinn é uma comissária de acção e que irá até o fim. A investigação e a inovação são os instrumentos-chave.
Agora que as empresas estão regularmente envolvidas em vendas transfronteiras no âmbito do mercado interno, faz sentido oferecer aos consumidores protecção transfronteiriça. No entanto, a harmonização não é algo que possa ser alcançado à força. Por isso, votei a favor deste relatório.
Agora que esta primeira iniciativa, a do diálogo de alto nível, não foi bem sucedida, inquieta-me deveras que a nossa principal preocupação já não seja tanto a questão de saber como poderemos porventura conseguir êxitos concretos nesse diálogo de alto nível, mas que, em lugar disso, já estejamos a ponderar sobre se devemos efectivamente negociar um acordo de comércio livre.
Agora que muitas das iniciativas foram definidas, cabe a cada Estado-Membro e à União Europeia no seu conjunto aplicá-las correctamente, concedendo às PME maior liberdade de acção, permitindo-lhes participar em concursos públicos, adoptando o fundo europeu de patentes no futuro e transpondo o mais depressa possível a Directiva relativa aos atrasos de pagamento.
Agora que o Serviço Europeu de Acção Externa está a pôr em prática as suas regras de acesso à informação e aos documentos, sugeria-lhe que fizesse dele uma organização moderna, acessível aos cidadãos e que não veja a política externa como um domínio exclusivo de alguns diplomatas norteados pelo secretismo.
Agora que o programa de investigação Euratom irá em breve ser alargado para 2012 e 2013, a questão de Fukushima devia ser considerada como uma oportunidade para reflectirmos.
Agora que o tempo é escasso, gostaria de levantar duas questões importantes, mas igualmente problemáticas, neste relatório. A primeira é a segurança. Senhor Presidente, espero que o Secretário-Geral apresente em breve uma proposta para melhorar a segurança. No espaço de um ano, aproximadamente, tivemos três assaltos: no banco, na cantina e nos correios.
Agora quero fazer um apelo ao senhor deputado Daul, portanto, vou prosseguir em francês.
Agora temos conhecimento de que partidos da oposição e jornalistas estão a ser alvo de perseguição. Não se trata de nada de novo, mas devemos ter presente neste Parlamento a verdadeira natureza do regime de Aliyev.
Agora vemos uma luz no fundo do túnel. É por isso que afirmo que se trata, para nós, de uma grande vitória, porque apoiámos politicamente o processo, quer através das nossas próprias acções, quer em termos financeiros.
Agora é importante que as duas Partes no Acordo Global de Paz entabulem um diálogo ininterrupto e construtivo visando a resolução das questões ainda pendentes após o referendo e que são: a demarcação das fronteiras comuns, o regime de cidadania para os cidadãos do Norte e do Sul do Sudão, a partilha equitativa dos rendimentos do petróleo e a utilização dos oleodutos.
Agora é preciso que o regulamento sobre a etiquetagem dos produtos têxteis seja alargado a todos os outros sectores do mercado, coordenando as diversas propostas legislativas e insistindo em que a proposta sobre as fibras e os produtos têxteis, assim como o regulamento geral sobre a denominação de origem - aprovado em Estrasburgo em Outubro passado - sejam adoptados pelo Conselho com a maior brevidade possível.
Agora, V. Ex.ª pretende agravar a coisa com a aprovação da indigitação de Christine Lagarde - outro membro da elite política europeia, outra fanática do euro, mais uma pessoa que acredita na política de sustentação desse projecto do euro - e eu diria que, uma vez que é uma pessoa com um interesse na questão, ela é uma candidata francamente inadequada.
Agora, com o programa conjunto da UE e FMI para Portugal a aguardar aprovação na reunião do Eurogrupo Ecofin da próxima segunda-feira, damos início a um outro capítulo deste esforço indispensável.
Agora, estes novos testes de resistência foram melhorados sob a Autoridade Bancária Europeia (ABE), mas continuam a existir questões que são evitadas, devido ao controlo e à prevaricação por parte dos Estados-Membros. É mais que tempo de reconhecer que a mensagem contida nessa fraca vontade política não constitui resposta a esta crise e torna as soluções ainda mais caras.
Agora, muitos países signatários de Schengen também realizam inspecções policiais no quadro da respectiva legislação nacional, inspeccionando, por exemplo, voos dentro do espaço Schengen.
Agora, o comerciante tem de fornecer ao consumidor informações específicas na fase pré-contratual, tanto nos contratos celebrados nas instalações do comerciante, como em contratos firmados fora dos estabelecimentos comerciais e à distância.
Agora, os países com fronteiras externas facilmente acessíveis estão inundados de migrantes, mas a maioria dos requerentes de asilo está a instalar-se nos países com os sistemas de segurança social mais generosos. O facto de a concessão de condições iguais às da população nacional aos requerentes de asilo no acesso ao mercado de trabalho e à segurança social ter impulsionado a migração económica já era previsível.
Agora, seria melhor evoluir para um sistema de receitas directas baseado exclusivamente no produto interno bruto dos Estados-Membros ou para um modelo partilhado e uniforme de receitas, como, por exemplo, um imposto sobre o valor acrescentado.
Agora, também é manifesto que a dívida pública cresceu enormemente durante a recessão, primeiro, devido aos custos dos resgates dos bancos e às garantias que lhe estavam associadas e, segundo, mais importante ainda, devido aos custos da própria recessão. Sendo assim, a questão central é a seguinte: foram tiradas algumas lições sérias da crise bancária? Os bancos não só são responsáveis por aquilo que aconteceu no passado, mas também o são pelas dificuldades actuais, porque os mercados ainda não estão a funcionar bem.
Agora, temos de aprender que carregar o fardo da dívida dos bancos é muito pior.
Agora, tivemos este surto, e devemos por isso interrogar-nos sobre algumas questões. O surto terá a ver com as nossas práticas agrícolas, como o colega Peter Liese acaba de referir? Terá a ver com a agricultura intensiva, com a produção de frutos e produtos hortícolas em estufas? Terá a ver com a utilização excessiva de antibióticos na pecuária? Ou com o espalhamento de estrume? Uma rotulagem mais precisa dos géneros alimentícios ter-nos-ia ajudado a identificar mais rapidamente o foco de contaminação? Constato que o Conselho não se encontra hoje aqui presente, mas o Conselho está a resistir a que a indicação do país de origem figure, como deveria, no rótulo dos nossos géneros alimentícios.
Agrada-me particularmente a ideia da continuação dos pagamentos directos e a supressão explícita dos valores de referência históricos no n.º 15, bem como a distribuição mais justa entre os EstadosMembros e, no seio dos EstadosMembros, entre as regiões e as nações que os compõem, no n.º 16.
Agradecemos ao Conselho por voltar a aplicar sanções em matéria de vistos e um congelamento de activos aos altos funcionários do Estado bielorrusso, que demonstraram que a nossa grande preocupação com os cidadãos da Bielorrússia não é apenas retórica vã. Talvez não tenhamos sido suficientemente explícitos.
Agradeço ao Senhor Comissário pelas respostas, mas precisamos de saber em mais detalhe como tenciona colmatar esta lacuna no Regulamento sobre as transferências de resíduos.
Agradeço muito a vossa atenção e aguardo com expectativa os vossos contributos e observações.
Agradeço os contributos de todos neste debate e, em particular, as sínteses do Comissário Olli Rehn e da Presidência do Secretário de Estado, András Kármán . Só queria sublinhar o seguinte: de facto, foram feitas concessões de parte a parte e penso que estamos muito próximos do equilíbrio, mas eu não queria que deixassem de registar, como matéria importante a tratar, a questão da simetria e assimetria.
Agradeço também o vosso apoio permanente à política regional europeia e ao seu desenvolvimento.
Agradeço, pois, à Presidência húngara os esforços envidados para continuar esse progresso, embora reconhecendo que, no que respeita ao processo de quitação, o Conselho aconselha ou recomenda mas é o Parlamento - a única Instituição democrática da União Europeia, eleita por sufrágio directo dos cidadãos europeus - quem decide e aprova a decisão final.
Agradeço, por conseguinte ao senhor deputado Pitella, à relatora e a todos os deputados que tiveram a coragem de não ceder um palmo naquilo que consideramos verdadeiramente útil para o nosso povo.
Agradeço, uma vez mais, ao Parlamento pelo seu contributo para o debate interinstitucional através das alterações apresentadas, algumas das quais deram particular relevo à dimensão política e ao interesse dos consumidores nesta questão. Com efeito, aquando da primeira leitura deste relatório, em que foi aprovado pelo Parlamento por uma ampla maioria, foi salientada a necessidade de relançar um vasto debate sobre a etiquetagem dos produtos têxteis, incluindo a questão das denominações de origem, e propusemos alargar o campo de aplicação do regulamento a determinados sectores.
Agradeço-lhe a observação.
Agradeço-lhe muito essa referência simpática e essa recordação. Queria que levasse ao Conselho o retrato deste debate e, sobretudo, como espero, o retrato da votação que faremos amanhã, que acredito vai ser muito expressiva, que o Conselho perceba que quando a assembleia que representa os cidadãos da Europa por uma tão grande maioria, como espero, diz sim à Bulgária e à Roménia, espero que o Conselho o faça no mais curto espaço possível de tempo.
Agradou-me especialmente constatar que foi aprovada uma proposta que vai além dos princípios de segurança fundamentais estabelecidos pela Agência Internacional da Energia Atómica (AIEA) e que impõe normas de segurança ainda mais rigorosas que reflectem as práticas mais avançadas a nível regulamentar e operacional e a melhor tecnologia disponível (MTD).
Agravar os custos a assumir pelo sector significa aumentar a carga a suportar pela sociedade no seu todo e penalizar as nossas mercadorias, o que terá como consequência uma quebra na procura.
Aguardamos também com expectativa propostas legislativas sobre a carga fiscal aplicável aos bens culturais, a governação das sociedades de gestão colectiva e a dotação orçamental a favor dos programas relativos à cultura, à educação e aos meios de comunicação social.
Aguardo com expectativa a nossa futura cooperação.
Aguardo com expectativa poder apresentar o mais rapidamente possível os resultados.
Aguardo, por isso, com expectativa novas propostas que tornem estas novas medidas obrigatórias e que incluam os custos de todos os danos causados ao ambiente e alarguem o princípio do "poluidor-pagador" a todos os modos de transporte.
Ainda a este respeito, falamos também, por exemplo, na resolução da questão dos direitos de autor, no financiamento às indústrias culturais e criativas, na mobilidade dos artistas e no lançamento de produções culturais.
Ainda assim, a AEP tem de intensificar os seus esforços.
Ainda assim, considero aceitável a ideia expressa no n. 37, que propõe uma proibição de construção em terrenos desbravados por acção de incêndios comprovadamente resultantes de fogo posto.
Ainda assim, há quem defenda que a estratégia de gestão da crise, designadamente no caso da Grécia, está a falhar.
Ainda assim, pese embora o esforço orçamental sem precedentes do ano passado - mais de 7% do PIB, ou 20 mil milhões de euros - é evidente que a Grécia ainda tem de reforçar a execução das reformas económicas, avançar com o programa de privatizações e, em seguida, proceder à sua total implementação.
Ainda considera que a formação profissional e a aprendizagem ao longo da vida devem ser mais orientadas para as necessidades do mercado de trabalho, permitindo a entrada e a mobilidade no mercado de trabalho.
Ainda dentro do pacote legislativo destinado a reforçar a governação económica na UE e na zona do euro, foi votado o presente projecto de parecer que diz respeito à execução eficaz da supervisão orçamental na área do euro.
Ainda haverá que ultrapassar alguns obstáculos para a semana mas, assim o espero, teremos um desfecho positivo na votação de amanhã. Assim, ainda temos uma semana pela frente e faço votos de que, em Julho, possamos finalmente tomar uma decisão em primeira leitura, pois 98% do caminho já está percorrido.
Ainda hoje, a Comissão adoptou a terceira proposta sobre direitos processuais, a proposta destinada a garantir o acesso a um advogado e a que uma terceira pessoa seja notificada quando alguém é privado da sua liberdade. O documento incluirá uma disposição para o acesso a um advogado no país emissor e nos Estados de execução nos casos de Mandados de Detenção Europeus.
Ainda há muito a fazer no sentido de simplificar o ambiente regulamentar e as formalidades burocráticas que impõem restrições demasiado pesadas à actividade e ao dinamismo das nossas empresas.
Ainda mais grave é o facto de o Governo húngaro não utilizar a Presidência da UE para contribuir para a construção de uma Europa unida, mas para apoiar o ressurgimento de um nacionalismo que há muito considerávamos esquecido.
Ainda mal passaram três meses desde que este Parlamento aprovou um relatório sobre a execução da Directiva "Serviços” no qual chamamos a atenção principalmente para o facto de os balcões únicos não se encontrarem completamente operacionais, de na maioria dos casos não darem a possibilidade de completar as formalidades por via electrónica e não funcionarem de acordo com as expectativas das empresas.
Ainda na última semana, recebi mais uma carta a perguntar: "Como me posso defender? Não tenho dinheiro para contratar um advogado, pelo que não posso intentar uma acção legal". Creio que devemos de uma vez por todas fornecer aos cidadãos europeus meios eficazes para se libertarem deste problema.
Ainda nada se fez para dar maior divulgação à ideia de que a União Europeia só poderá manter o rumo que desejamos e proporcionar uma vida melhor a todos os europeus se formos bem-sucedidos no resgate da Grécia e na estabilização do sul, e penso que há, de facto, uma instituição responsável por isso: o Conselho Europeu.
Ainda não estamos nesse ponto, mas tem havido muitos progressos no Kosovo e estamos a trabalhar muito estreitamente com o governo, apoiando-os e ajudando-os a progredir.
Ainda não ouvi falar em quaisquer planos a respeito do que fazer com os resíduos nucleares espalhados pelo local e cuja eliminação ainda não se encontra assegurada.
Ainda ontem o respeitado centro de estudos Open Europe publicou alguns dados que corroboram parte da minha "retórica". Diz ele que a exposição do BCE ao Estado e aos bancos gregos ascende a uns assombrosos 190 mil milhões de euros.
Ainda que a posição do Parlamento no que respeita à revisão do Tratado Euratom tenha um valor meramente consultivo, os eurodeputados enviaram uma mensagem clara ao Conselho: a UE tem de se munir de meios apropriados para desenvolver uma política energética responsável que possa transmitir às gerações vindouras.
Ainda que nem todos os interesses individuais possam ter sido tidos em consideração no compromisso, o relatório foi aprovado por uma grande maioria na Comissão da Agricultura e do Desenvolvimento Rural. O resultado claro da votação é um sinal inequívoco para a Comissão sobre a forma que a Comissão da Agricultura e do Desenvolvimento Rural pretende que a PAC assuma no horizonte 2020.
Ainda recentemente a Europol efectuou ofensivas consideráveis contra alguns destas organizações criminosas, identificando grupos europeus que actuam transfronteiras e que estão envolvidos na pornografia infantil, por exemplo, mas também no tráfico de droga. Há, pois, um grande número de especialistas da Europol a trabalhar nestas matérias.
Ainda subsistem alguns problemas, designadamente nas definições. Para além do trabalho doméstico, o artigo 1.º deve abranger os serviços domésticos. O artigo referente aos períodos de descanso é igualmente problemático.
Ainda é necessário um esforço para garantir uma gestão saudável dos dinheiros públicos e evitar a dispersão dos financiamentos em projectos pouco eficientes ou que não respondem às nossas necessidades.
Ajudar outros países a construírem sociedades democráticas estáveis em países regidos pelo Estado de direito, onde os direitos humanos são respeitados e a liberdade de expressão é uma garantia, dispondo de um sistema judicial sólido e dotados de forças de defesa territorial e de forças armadas é um projecto louvável.
Ajudaremos a senhora baronesa Ashton a estabelecer o Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa (SEAE). No entanto, também esperamos o tipo de liderança que permita a formulação de políticas a um nível mais elevado e que convença os Estados-Membros, apesar do requisito complexo da unanimidade.
Ajustar as despesas da UE aos objectivos é uma das maneiras de impulsionar as economias locais e criar empregos para as nossas comunidades.
Al-Nashiri esteve encarecrado na Polónia, numa prisão secreta criada pela CIA, onde foi sujeito a intensa tortura. Nós, Europeus, temos finalmente de aceitar com seriedade a nossa quota-parte de responsabilidade por estas violações dos direitos humanos. A prática de silenciar os factos, varrendo-os para debaixo do tapete e permitindo que os responsáveis permaneçam impunes, não deve continuar. O debate de hoje mostra que não é útil falar em termos superficiais acerca de sentimentos anti-americanos ou anti-europeus.
Alargar o seu alcance poderia, por conseguinte, ser essencial no contexto do seu maior desenvolvimento.
Alcançar a coesão social, económica e territorial é um dos objectivos importantes do projecto europeu. É uma meta que todos os Estados-Membros fixaram, enquanto parte do processo de integração europeia. É precisamente por isso que penso que o processo de financiamento de projectos de coesão deve basear-se numa disciplina financeira rigorosa, na implementação em áreas estratégicas e, por último mas não menos importante, no princípio da boa governação. O objectivo é reduzir as disparidades entre as regiões da Europa.
Alcançámos uma eficácia de 75% até agora e cerca de 50 000 PME receberam fundos desta forma.
Alegais agir no espírito de uma Europa comum quando arrastais a nova constituição da Hungria para ser dissecada nesta Assembleia.
Alem disso, a criação de uma comissão conjunta e de várias subcomissões permitirá às empresas europeias e canadianas poupar milhões de euros por ano, graças à aceitação mútua de conclusões de certificação. As autoridades importadoras poderão emitir os seus próprios certificados sobre produtos, peças ou equipamentos aeronáuticos sem duplicar todas as avaliações levadas a cabo pela autoridade exportadora.
Algo de tremendamente errado se passa com a globalidade do sistema se as irregularidades da Grécia e o swap da Goldman-Sachs para ocultar a dívida grega eram conhecidos no mercado há muitos anos, pois era comum Atenas rever os seus dados orçamentais sempre que um novo governo tomava posse, e o Estado recebia uma boa notação de crédito; e a resposta brusca e violenta só veio quando estalou a crise financeira e económica, provocando falências, penalizando Estados cujos bancos garantiram empréstimos precários e, simultaneamente, apostando muito dinheiro em países à beira da bancarrota.
Algo que é extremamente importante é a utilização eficaz do Fundo Social Europeu, em moldes que permitam reinserir os desempregados no mercado de trabalho e não apenas dar-lhes formação, uma prática muito comum. É importante que existam recursos disponíveis para a inovação, a investigação e o desenvolvimento, porque isso contribui para reforçar a competitividade de empresas e regiões.
Algumas agências, como a OSHA, tiveram um aumento do orçamento de 105% e um aumento do pessoal de 69% em 10 anos. A Eurofound teve um aumento do orçamento de 39% e um aumento do pessoal de 46%. É por isso que apelo urgentemente aos meus colegas para que se introduzam alterações durante o debate do próximo orçamento.
Algumas das alterações que iremos votar amanhã em plenário poderão alterar este compromisso e equilíbrio, e eu apelo aos meus colegas deputados, ao relator e aos relatores-sombra, em particular, que proponham uma medida equilibrada aceitável para todos.
Algumas das propostas iniciais da senhora deputada Goulard, em particular a criação de um Fundo Monetário Europeu, não prevaleceram durante os trílogos.
Algumas das reformas necessárias para o cumprimento dos objectivos de médio prazo do programa estão a ser postas em prática. O relatório também identifica outros domínios que carecem de reformas com vista à consolidação da massa crítica necessária para garantir a sustentabilidade orçamental e a recuperação económica. A Comissão, o BCE e o FMI continuam a acompanhar de perto os progressos realizados na execução do programa de ajustamento. A próxima revisão está prevista para este mês.
Algumas das responsabilidade do segundo pilar da Política Agrícola Comum deveriam ser transferidas para a política de coesão. As zonas rurais têm o direito de prosseguir o seu próprio desenvolvimento, utilizando o dinheiro disponível no âmbito da política regional.
Algumas dessas questões são comuns a todas as agências ou apenas a algumas delas, incluindo, por exemplo, os cancelamentos e atrasos nos procedimentos de adjudicação de contratos, o incumprimento das disposições do Estatuto dos Funcionários, ou a violação do princípio da anualidade orçamental. O empenhamento destas agências em resolver os problemas apontados deve, contudo, ser realçado.
Algumas destas compras serão transfronteiriças. Elas proporcionarão aos consumidores uma gama de escolhas mais ampla, bem como preços mais baixos.
Algumas destas medidas podem implicar alterações na legislação. Outras não. O essencial é eleger as ferramentas adequadas para a tarefa em questão.
Algumas destas violações foram cometidas com a cumplicidade demonstrada de Estados-Membros da União Europeia que colocaram os seus territórios à disposição da CIA.
Algumas pessoas defendem que, em circunstâncias de grandes défices orçamentários e níveis elevados de dívida, os Estados-Membros deverão contribuir o mínimo possível para o orçamento da UE. Creio que isso é um erro.
Algumas prioridades incluídas pelo S&D, e que sublinho, são, por exemplo: 1) investimento para emprego e crescimento; 2) dimensão social e direitos e condições dos trabalhadores; 3) sustentabilidade; 4) valor acrescentado europeu; 5) uma proposta de estrutura e uma proposta de duração.
Alguns Estados-Membros - a imprensa menciona a Grécia, a Itália e a Espanha, podendo a Alemanha fazer também parte desse grupo - opõem-se a que tal aconteça. Nesse caso, Senhora Baronesa Ashton, deverá erguer-se e dizer, perante esta Assembleia: "Só pudemos pôr 13 nomes na lista".
Alguns Estados-Membros definiram posições no sentido do reconhecimento da importância extrema da questão dos fluxos migratórios.
Alguns Estados-Membros não pertencentes à área do euro são também abrangidos pelos programas de apoio à balança de pagamentos da Comissão e do FMI.
Alguns Estados-Membros, incluindo a França, a Alemanha e os Países Baixos, pretendem alterar as regras do jogo.
Alguns Membros do Parlamento dizem-me que o problema está no nosso financiamento, porque não podem usá-lo na forma que querem; mas temos flexibilidade: os Estados-Membros podem reafectar o seu financiamento - qualquer Estado-Membro o pode fazer. Só a Itália nos pediu uma reafectação e nós aprovámo-la. Por que é que os Senhores Deputados não tentam então persuadir os Estados-Membros - os governos dos vossos países - a usar os fundos adequadamente? Se queremos realmente ajudar e se há um problema com a absorção do financiamento, estou aqui para facilitar estas questões, mas até agora ainda não se procedeu a um esforço nesse sentido.
Alguns aspectos são muitíssimo importantes para prestar apoio a estes países no futuro.
Alguns colegas criticaram o facto de o factor humano não ter sido avaliado, nem levado em devida consideração. Devo dizer que li atentamente a especificação destes testes de stress, e estou satisfeita por os testes abrangerem não só a tecnologia, mas também o factor humano e os aspectos organizacionais.
Alguns colegas deputados afirmaram que se trata de uma questão da soberania húngara. Não é verdade, mas esta Constituição viola a soberania de outros Estados.
Alguns de vós - o senhor deputado Ludvigsson, a senhora deputada Ford, o senhor deputado Cancian e, mesmo agora, a senhora deputada Băsescu -, pediram que os testes fossem - e repito o que ouvi - rigorosos, credíveis e transparentes.
Alguns de vós - principalmente o Grupo da Aliança dos Democratas e Liberais pela Europa - questionaram-me a respeito da metodologia aplicada neste contexto, como a senhora deputada Wortmann-Kool fez há alguns instantes. O cenário adverso proposto pela autoridade bancária, a ABE, prevê um choque significativo sob a forma de oscilações de preços da dívida soberana e do custo do respectivo financiamento.
Alguns deles vêem aqui nada menos do que uma espécie de imperialismo cultural.
Alguns deputados avançaram a ideia de que nos devemos concentrar nos acordos multilaterais e não nos bilaterais. É o que fazemos! Como é do vosso conhecimento, as negociações multilaterais da Ronda de Doha encontram-se em grandes dificuldades e nós somos o único grande bloco comercial que fez recentemente propostas para tentar ultrapassar as diferenças entre as economias desenvolvidas e emergentes no tocante aos sectores industriais.
Alguns deputados perguntaram sobre a situação em Gaza, se dispomos de garantias de que a ajuda chega ao seu destino, se continuamos a apoiar o povo de Gaza - o que fazemos, muito embora tenhamos iniciado um diálogo no sentido de introduzir melhorias nessa área.
Alguns destes países dependem de nós enquanto grande mercado para as suas exportações e como fonte das suas importações. Permitir a esses países desenvolver os seus mercados pode ser muito importante, através do apoio não unicamente à abertura de mercados, mas ao acesso aos mesmos, garantindo que podem alcançar os nossos padrões, e assegurando que têm oportunidades reais.
Alguns dos meus colegas comissários tiveram um diálogo frutuoso com a Comissão do Controlo Orçamental, e houve muita informação que foi partilhada convosco.
Alguns entusiásticos colegas de esquerda sugerem que cheguemos a acordo quanto à uniformidade dos tamanhos, quando desconhecemos a origem dos produtos usados pelos consumidores.
Alguns partidos apoiados pelo Kremlin e uma Frente Popular Pan-Russa lançada pelo Primeiro-Ministro Putin estão simplesmente a levar-nos para um impasse político.
Alguns pontos referidos pela senhora deputada Quisthoudt-Rowohl e outros prendem-se com segurança e justiça. Foi precisamente nisto que todos nos pusemos de acordo: os investimentos devem ser justos, as pessoas devem ser tratadas com justiça e devemos ter um nível de segurança razoável.
Alguns pontos, nomeadamente o n.º 44, sobre o apoio às medidas nacionais de protecção e preservação do património cultural e de combate ao tráfico ilegal de património ou produtos culturais, não fazem muito sentido.
Algures no futuro, e ainda não se sabe quando, os tratados bilaterais de investimento ficarão sob a alçada da Comissão. Por causa do Tratado de Lisboa, os tratados de investimento poderão tornar-se um instrumento para os objectivos políticos da Comissão - e não apenas da Comissão: não tenhamos qualquer dúvida de que os Verdes tentarão promover o seu programa político; temos assistido constantemente a isto nos tratados comerciais.
Aliviar a situação do sector a curto prazo, com medidas como a proposta pela Senhora Comissária de mobilizar e encorajar a mobilização do Fundo Europeu das Pescas, parece-me um passo positivo, que creio dever ser compatível com outras medidas e uma acção a longo prazo conducente a uma maior estabilidade.
Aliás, as conclusões do parecer científico da Autoridade Europeia para a Segurança dos Alimentos no final de 2007 baseiam-se em dados relativos ao abate de animais em matadouros, que não são fiáveis no que diz respeito à caça à foca. A base jurídica também é questionável, tal como demonstra o parecer jurídico do Parlamento Europeu, datado de 1 de Abril de 2009, que refere que é praticamente impossível justificar a proibição apenas com base no bem-estar animal, dado que o Tratado não contém base jurídica em matéria de bem-estar animal. A protecção da espécie não está em causa, pois, inclusivamente, em 25 anos, a população triplicou na Gronelândia. A concluir, um embargo em que a Comissão assegura que não haveria impacto sobre a caça tradicional dos Inuit é utópico.
Aliás, há já algum tempo que o Parlamento Europeu vem exigindo a aprovação de uma directiva neste domínio.
Aliás, todo o processo requer maior transparência, e isto só pode se assegurado através de um envolvimento acrescido do Parlamento Europeu e dos parlamentos nacionais.
Aliás, é uma política que exige intervenção, como consagrado nos Tratados, mas que exige também que essa intervenção assuma novas formas.
Altera para a volatilidade dos preços e solicita que sejam criadas soluções, a nível global, para combater as especulações com produtos de base agrícola e a extrema volatilidade dos preços. É ainda defendida uma rede de segurança e é promovida a associação de pequenos produtores. São diagnosticados alguns dos problemas gerados pelo mercado, é dada mais ênfase às questões ambientais e sociais.
Alteração das normas na sequência da criação de um registo comum em matéria de transparência (
Aludindo à explicação que o deputado Stevenson lhe dirigiu, existe uma solução. Esperamos que tome medidas imediatas e firmes para torná-la possível, e congratulamo-nos com o compromisso que assumiu esta manhã.
Além da discussão no quadro das cimeiras UE-Rússia, devemos certificar-nos de que há um reforço importante das consultas que se realizam duas vezes por ano com representantes da União Europeia e diplomatas do Ministério dos Negócios Estrangeiros russo.
Além da existência de uma política harmonizada a nível da UE, é particularmente importante assegurar uma boa colaboração e coordenação no plano local entre as várias instituições e ministérios envolvidos em programas de educação dos jovens.
Além da questão das frequências, isto está relacionado com a diversidade cultural e pressupõe igualmente que se tenha em consideração que opções técnicas estão ou não disponíveis e são ou não acessíveis. A acessibilidade dos preços é uma preocupação, por exemplo, para organizações culturais que não possuem muito dinheiro e que nem sempre têm apoios para adquirir novo equipamento.
Além da redução da incidência do abandono escolar precoce e do aumento da percentagem de pessoas com um diploma universitário até 2020, gostaria de salientar alguns aspectos que podem proporcionar apoio aos jovens. O primeiro é a importância da elaboração de programas educativos mais flexíveis que sejam compatíveis com a manutenção de um posto de trabalho em simultâneo com os estudos. O segundo é a vantagem de dispor de um sistema de mobilidade virtual para complementar a mobilidade geográfica.
Além das compensações, temos de implementar uma estratégia de longo prazo que permita aos pescadores e aos profissionais de outros sectores, como os agricultores e os transportadores rodoviários, reduzirem a dependência dos combustíveis fósseis. É por esta razão que a Comissão tem de dar incentivos ao investimento em novas tecnologias tanto a nível europeu como nacional com o objectivo de aumentar a eficiência energética a nível dos transportes marítimos, rodoviários e aéreos.
Além de manifestar a nossa solidariedade para com as vítimas e de condenar a violência, dadas as preocupações quanto à falta de independência do sistema judicial, é essencial promover uma investigação séria, imparcial e transparente por um organismo independente, de modo a que os responsáveis de ambas as facções do conflito possam ser identificados e punidos.
Além de prever financiamento para a investigação e desenvolvimento, a energia e o transporte, temos também de considerar investimentos nos domínios da coesão e da agricultura.
Além de ser o relator acidental, sou também um relator constrangido porque, na verdade, não votei nele e tenho as mais fundas objecções ao seu conteúdo. Mas as coisas são como são e não me resta senão assumir, com galhardia, esta incumbência que me foi dada.
Além disso faz sugestões sólidas e de grande alcance para a UE em vários domínios ao nível internacional, nomeadamente o estabelecimento de relações com os parceiros estratégicos da UE no sistema da ONU, a garantia de um papel importante para o SEAE, a promoção da paz, da segurança e da justiça e o combate às alterações climáticas.
Além disso, 40% das florestas da UE são estatais. O rácio comunitário entre o abate e o acréscimo estabilizou-se em torno dos 60%. Prevê-se que este rácio aumente em diversos países para mais de 100%, causando uma diminuição do volume em crescimento após 2020. É vital que se tomem medidas para proteger as florestas.
Além disso, Alexander Lukashenko está a perder o controlo da situação do país e do seu próprio comportamento, como demonstram as declarações surpreendentes e chocantes que proferiu sobre o Presidente da Ucrânia e o Presidente Barroso.
Além disso, Mario Draghi demonstrou um desejo autêntico de implementar um modelo reforçado de governação económica a nível da UE, para evitar situações de insolvência da dívida soberana. É precisamente por isso que, na sua candidatura, ele dá prioridade ao combate à inflação como parte do objectivo de estabilidade do Banco Central Europeu, assim como ao reforço dos mecanismos de supervisão. É necessário um Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento realmente eficaz, dotado de sanções automáticas, para assegurar uma economia forte.
Além disso, Senhor Deputado Farage e Senhora Deputada Swinburne, se pensarem que vão defender a chamada soberania do Reino Unido - e isso aplica-se a todos os Estados-Membros, sejam eles pequenos como é o meu, ou grandes, como a Alemanha, a França e o Reino Unido -, se pensarem que, sozinhos, irão conseguir exercer alguma influência no mundo, então penso que estão lamentavelmente enganados.
Além disso, a Comissão está a colaborar estreitamente com os Estados-Membros e com as Presidências da UE em prol do desenvolvimento de indicadores para o seguimento, a nível da UE, das 12 áreas da chamada Plataforma de Acção de Pequim.
Além disso, a Comissão não propõe assumir qualquer compromisso que pudesse limitar a liberdade de regulamentação da UE nem em questões ambientais, como a qualidade dos combustíveis, nem em qualquer outro objectivo político essencial.
Além disso, a Constituição concede ao Conselho Orçamental, um organismo que não é eleito directamente, o poder de vetar as decisões do Parlamento em matéria orçamental, o que, por sua vez, pode resultar na dissolução do Parlamento e na realização de novas eleições, ameaçando assim uma governação estável. O nível de protecção dos direitos humanos diminuiu.
Além disso, a Frontex e os acordos de readmissão devem continuar a ser desenvolvidos e os imigrantes ilegais devem ser sistematicamente deportados.
Além disso, a UE, apesar das suas limitações, é um interveniente principal à escala mundial, com uma importância que deve ser devidamente reconhecida a todos os níveis.
Além disso, a agricultura necessita de apoio para inovar e centrar o esforço numa utilização mais eficiente da energia, da água e do solo.
Além disso, a colaboração entre os sectores público e privado através da realização de parcerias constitui uma importante forma de incentivar uma economia mais inovadora.
Além disso, a crescente mobilidade está a cobrar a sua factura em termos da pegada de carbono das populações, o que pode acelerar as alterações climáticas a nível global.
Além disso, a cultura e a criatividade são fundamentais para salvaguardar e valorizar o nosso património cultural e paisagístico e são úteis para aumentar o nível cultural dos cidadãos. Não devemos subestimar o facto de essas indústrias constituírem um dos sectores mais dinâmicos na Europa e contribuírem para 2,6% do produto interno bruto da UE, proporcionando emprego de qualidade a cerca de 5 milhões de cidadãos europeus.
Além disso, a declaração da Alta Representante para os Assuntos Externos e a Política de Segurança sobre Yulia Tymoshenko foi excepcionalmente cuidadosa.
Além disso, a dimensão qualitativa das despesas é pelo menos tão importante como a dimensão quantitativa.
Além disso, a economia russa, que se baseia principalmente no petróleo e no gás, não necessita verdadeiramente de aderir à OMC.
Além disso, a fim de evitar que esta medida se esgote apenas em declarações, a responsabilidade é atribuída, em geral, aos Estados-Membros, e é lamentável que os recentes programas de reformas nacionais não sejam coerentes com os objectivos da Estratégia UE 2020, apesar de todos reconhecermos que o investimento em investigação e educação é um investimento a longo prazo com um retorno positivo que influenciará claramente a prosperidade futura dos cidadãos europeus.
Além disso, a formação de alianças europeias para a cooperação territorial deve ser facilitada, porque este novo instrumento tornará mais fácil o acesso das administrações locais e dos cidadãos a uma maior cooperação, beneficiando muitas regiões, em especial as regiões fronteiriças.
Além disso, a ideia de políticas europeias conjuntas e sustentáveis cedeu, mais do que uma vez, aos interesses dos maiores países da "antiga" UE, de que é um exemplo perfeito a inexistência de uma regra que assegure o equilíbrio geográfico no preenchimento de cargos no Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa.
Além disso, a introdução de um quadro comum para a recolha, a compilação, a transmissão e a avaliação das contas económicas do ambiente da União Europeia facilitaria a avaliação política da política do ambiente da UE.
Além disso, a introdução de um sistema trilingue não parece estar em conformidade com os requisitos administrativos nem reflecte o peso demográfico dos diferentes Estados-Membros, porque, a ser assim, a Itália teria de estar também representada.
Além disso, a permanente evolução tecnológica cria, nos empregadores, expectativas crescentes quanto às qualificações dos trabalhadores.
Além disso, a proposta não toma em consideração os problemas específicos das zonas periféricas, onde é necessária uma maior coordenação.
Além disso, a rentabilidade implica o alinhamento das políticas neste sector com os objectivos da Estratégia Europa 2020.
Além disso, a senhora deputada Balzani elaborou um mandato que é bastante razoável, dado que nele se incluem todas as condições que serão negociadas nas próximas Perspectivas Financeiras. A senhora deputada insiste na importância da estratégia Europa 2020, da quantificação do orçamento, da necessidade de ter em conta as dotações não autorizadas, a segurança e a credibilidade do orçamento.
Além disso, a utilização de satélites fornecerá uma oportunidade para o desenvolvimento e a utilização de inúmeras aplicações diferentes.
Além disso, a Índia é o maior beneficiário do Sistema de Preferências Generalizadas (SPG), e as importações da Índia para a União Europeia à taxa preferencial ou taxa zero elevaram-se a 19,9 mil milhões de euros em 2009, correspondendo a 83% do total das importações da Índia para a UE. Ambas as partes esperam tirar benefícios significativos da eliminação dos direitos aduaneiros, da liberalização do comércio de serviços e do arranque de novas empresas, mas partilho a decepção expressa na resolução relativamente ao ritmo lento das negociações sobre o Acordo de Comércio Livre (ACL). Ambas as partes devem envidar todos os esforços para concluir um ACL abrangente, ambicioso e coordenado até ao final de 2011, uma vez que este acordo será a base para a criação de mais oportunidades comerciais e de investimento e para o desenvolvimento de negócios entre a UE e a Índia.
Além disso, aborda questões importantes, designadamente: reforçar o papel do Tribunal Penal Internacional e o sistema de justiça penal a nível internacional, promover a responsabilização, pôr termo à impunidade e reforçar as estruturas de prevenção de crises e a sua eficácia no quadro do Programa das Nações Unidas para o Desenvolvimento tendo em vista transformar esta organização num líder mundial no domínio da prevenção de crises e da reconstrução. Destaca ainda a necessidade de uma cooperação estreita entre a UE e a ONU no domínio da gestão civil e militar das crises, em particular, no domínio das operações de ajuda humanitária, e a necessidade de reformar cabalmente a Agência Internacional da Energia Atómica (AIEA), pondo termo à sua dupla função de controlo e promoção da utilização da energia atómica, e limitar as responsabilidades da AIEA em termos de supervisão do sector da energia atómica e de verificação da observância do Tratado de Não Proliferação, bem como outras matérias relevantes, com que, na generalidade, concordo e que apoio.
Além disso, acredito no princípio do poluidor-pagador e também votei a favor da alteração que preconiza uma avaliação dos custos, o acompanhamento, a apresentação de relatórios regulares à Comissão Europeia e a participação dos governos nacionais.
Além disso, adoptar uma abordagem sistemática e sinérgica entre os vários fundos regionais europeus contribuirá para a adopção de objectivos da política de coesão e, logo, a redução de disparidades de desenvolvimento entre regiões europeias, além de facilitar a inclusão social.
Além disso, ainda não sabemos como os outros países, no âmbito da OMC, agirão e se acabarão por dar o seu consentimento.
Além disso, apenas cerca de um terço das pessoas concluiu o ensino superior, sendo esta proporção significativamente mais reduzida do que nos Estados Unidos ou no Japão, por exemplo.
Além disso, apoiaremos a introdução de medidas de salvaguarda bilaterais, como no caso do ACL UE-Coreia do Sul, a fim de evitar causar prejuízos graves em sectores sensíveis, como sejam a indústria automóvel, da electrónica, da aviação e da maquinaria.
Além disso, apoio a ideia apresentada pelo deputado Klinz da criação de uma Fundação Europeia de Notação de Crédito independente de Estados e instituições e também considero que as actuais estruturas de oligopólio constituem um problema para o sector.
Além disso, apresenta propostas válidas a fim de que as verbas ainda por atribuir possam dar um contributo real para o aumento da competitividade e da qualidade no mercado europeu.
Além disso, as autoridades responderam aos recentes protestos de 11 de Março e de 2 de Abril com detenções e perseguições. A democracia baseia-se na livre expressão da vontade dos cidadãos. Exorto o Conselho e a Comissão a instarem as autoridades do Azerbaijão a respeitarem os direitos humanos, sobretudo os direitos associados à liberdade de expressão e de manifestação pacífica, assim como a tomarem medidas concretas de combate à corrupção e de reforma do sistema judicial. A União Europeia tem de apoiar todos os cidadãos que arriscam a vida e a liberdade nesse país em prol dos valores que partilhamos.
Além disso, as florestas são essenciais para todos nós e fazem parte da nossa identidade.
Além disso, as inovações desse tipo, em que a atenção deve continuar a incidir sobre a investigação, contribuiriam para manter os níveis de vida elevados na Europa. O relatório recebeu o meu voto favorável porque o facto de permitir aos cidadãos comuns o desempenho de um papel na formação da sociedade constitui um avanço positivo.
Além disso, as leis da Bielorrússia não permitem a liberdade de reunião, muito menos a liberdade de expressão. A intimidação da oposição e dos grupos independentes de defesa dos direitos humanos tornou-se agora um problema crónico do país. Uma democracia funcional depende da participação activa da oposição e da sociedade civil no debate político.
Além disso, as necessárias traduções ainda não estavam disponíveis.
Além disso, as transferências ilícitas de resíduos para os países em desenvolvimento têm efeitos adversos no comércio e na concorrência, visto que, em termos económicos, as empresas que respeitam a legislação são confrontadas, evidentemente, com a concorrência e ficam numa posição de desvantagem. O sector europeu da reciclagem e da gestão de resíduos, que é obrigado a cumprir a rigorosa legislação ambiental da UE, é um sector dinâmico.
Além disso, através de acções de notação, o conjunto de garantias à disposição dos bancos gregos com toda a probabilidade ficaria reduzido a nada.
Além disso, através do Tratado, a União tornou-se um participante pleno na política internacional. O Tratado de Lisboa reforçou os instrumentos de política externa da União Europeia, sobretudo no seio das Nações Unidas. A esse respeito, gostaria de chamar a atenção para o ponto 12 da proposta de resolução - o primeiro passo rumo a uma acção coordenada e eficaz dos Estados-Membros no Conselho de Segurança. De salientar que, neste momento, as Nações Unidas têm em curso um processo de reforma das suas estruturas, o que permitirá igualmente que a representação da UE naquele fórum seja reestruturada.
Além disso, cabe aos Estados-Membros, não à UE, determinar a forma como a ajuda ao desenvolvimento deve ser prestada.
Além disso, como bem sabemos, elas representam mais de 90% do nosso tecido empresarial e constituem um modelo valioso que tem de ser preservado, porque os efeitos da falência ou deslocalização de uma grande empresa são muito mais devastadores, sobretudo em termos de emprego.
Além disso, como salientaram os meus colegas, a nova Constituição húngara refere a Carta dos Direitos Fundamentais, o que constitui um novo elemento constitucional, e considera as minorias da Hungria como parte integrante da comunidade política do país. O Comissário Parlamentar para as Gerações Futuras da Hungria afirmou que o texto eleva a protecção ambiental e a responsabilidade perante as gerações futuras a um nível extraordinário.
Além disso, como um subproduto simultâneo, e sem custos adicionais, podemos obter bases de dados geométricas muito rigorosas que podem ser usadas para acompanhar e gerir o artefacto em caso de catástrofe natural, bem como de produtos destinados à educação científica e à promoção do artefacto à escala mundial, preenchendo os critérios de difusão e de intercâmbio cultural.
Além disso, conhecemos a geoestratégia dos riscos terroristas.
Além disso, constitui provavelmente uma abordagem muito realista, considerando a capacidade que os Estados-Membros possuem para iniciar um sistema de contas nestas áreas.
Além disso, cumpre assinalar - e o próprio Comissário Dalli o afirmou - que as autoridades alemãs assumiram claramente a atitude de que passariam bem sem os especialistas da União Europeia, acreditando complacente e arrogantemente de que não necessitavam deles.
Além disso, de uma maneira geral, o capítulo relativo ao investimento tem de respeitar o direito de ambas as partes de legislar em domínios como o ambiente, a saúde pública, os direitos dos trabalhadores e dos consumidores, a política industrial e a diversidade cultural, entre outros.
Além disso, deixa aos Estados apenas um direito, o de "regular" os serviços públicos, uma medida que é, no entanto, condenada por uma liberalização desta natureza.
Além disso, deve apostar em áreas emblemáticas como a saúde, a energia e a segurança nuclear, respondendo aos novos desafios da inovação e investigação.
Além disso, devem ser agora também incluídos na avaliação alargamentos anteriores.
Além disso, devemos assumir a liderança no estabelecimento de um sistema parlamentar a nível global. A diplomacia ao mais alto nível é obviamente necessária, mas deve ser conduzida tendo em conta o diálogo com os cidadãos. E a melhor forma de o conseguir não será permitir que os cidadãos de todo o mundo estejam representados na ONU? Existe o Parlamento Europeu, mas existem também parlamentos regionais, bem como a Assembleia Parlamentar Paritária ACP-UE. O que precisamos hoje é de um parlamento mundial.
Além disso, duas políticas fundamentais da União são colocadas no lugar que lhes é devido.
Além disso, durante a última reunião da comissão o relator especial da ONU sobre a tortura apresentou um documento útil que comporva prova que a CIA estabeleceu prisões deste género na Polónia.
Além disso, e com o objectivo de apoiar as actividades dessas empresas, convido a Comissão a implementar o princípio da reciprocidade e a ponderar novas formas de melhorar o acesso das empresas europeias ao mercado de contratos públicos fora da União, a fim de assegurar condições de igualdade entre as empresas europeias e estrangeiras que concorrem à adjudicação de contratos públicos.
Além disso, e especificamente para os países da zona euro, foram criados outros instrumentos que continuarão a ser desenvolvidos. A Grécia recebeu um pacote de empréstimos bilaterais coordenados de Estados-Membros assim como um empréstimo do FMI. A Irlanda recebeu um pacote composto por empréstimos bilaterais, um empréstimo do Fundo Europeu de Estabilidade Financeira (FEEF) e ainda um empréstimo do FMI. O pacote de ajuda a Portugal, que também irá recorrer ao apoio da UE e do FMI, está em preparação.
Além disso, e muito embora a responsabilidade social das empresas já esteja fortemente implantada na Europa, as empresas europeias e as suas subsidiárias e subcontratantes desempenham um papel decisivo na promoção e difusão de normas sociais e laborais a nível mundial, dado o seu peso no comércio internacional. A Comissão deve incentivá-las neste aspecto, especialmente através da identificação e promoção de boas práticas.
Além disso, e não obstante a criação do Comité de Avaliação de Impacto (CAI), criado pela Comissão Europeia, e os resultados positivos já obtidos, também acho fundamental a criação de uma estrutura autónoma de avaliação de impacto para o Parlamento Europeu.
Além disso, e passo a citar: "A imigração ilegal proveniente da Turquia estender-se-á às costas da Bulgária e aumentará o tráfico de droga e de seres humanos controlado por grupos da criminalidade turca e albanesa". Acresce que, relativamente ao tráfico de seres humanos, diz-se: "A adesão da Roménia e da Bulgária ao espaço Schengen poderá dar à criminalidade búlgara e às comunidades Roma novas oportunidades de expandirem o seu já significativo tráfico ao resto da Europa". Em última análise, um aumento da imigração ilegal proveniente da Turquia e um aumento do tráfico de droga e de seres humanos significam menos segurança para os cidadãos europeus.
Além disso, em caso de litígios comerciais, deve aplicar-se o princípio de reciprocidade; é necessário melhorar a protecção dos direitos de propriedade intelectual e deve haver acesso recíproco aos serviços e aos mercados de contratos públicos. O sector agrícola e os consumidores devem merecer uma atenção especial.
Além disso, em muitos dos textos que tem aprovado recentemente, traçando os objectivos em matéria de desenvolvimento e orientações para a próxima década, a União Europeia salienta a importância da investigação e da inovação para o fortalecimento da sua economia e para se manter como uma das mais competitivas do mundo.
Além disso, em resultado da severa política de austeridade que vigora em muitos países, é praticamente impossível os jovens conseguirem um emprego condigno quando terminam a sua formação. Actualmente, apenas um quarto dos jovens na Irlanda estão empregados e todas as semanas 1 000 pessoas emigram, por isso, para muitas famílias irlandesas, a expressão "Juventude em Movimento” tem um significado muito diferente. A presente crise de emprego só poderá ser resolvida com um grande esforço de investimento público, com vista a criar postos de trabalho condignos.
Além disso, entre os 600 000 presos na União Europeia, é cada vez mais elevado o número de pessoas detidas num Estado-Membro que não o seu, devido, precisamente, ao mandado de detenção europeu.
Além disso, esta Assembleia aprovou demasiado dinheiro e funcionários a mais.
Além disso, esta proibição seria aplicável imediatamente após a entrada em vigor do regulamento.
Além disso, esta supervisão deve ser ampliada para prevenir desequilíbrios macroeconómicos prejudiciais, com a garantia de que, no futuro, a supervisão não se limite à política orçamental, e que as suas competências se alarguem também à detecção precoce e à prevenção de potenciais desequilíbrios económicos prejudiciais. A supervisão macroeconómica não pode assentar num quadro estático e simplista.
Além disso, estamos constantemente em contacto com países terceiros, nomeadamente, a Rússia, para lhes pedir que levantem a sua proibição, que é desproporcionada. A Comissão está a trabalhar lado a lado com os Estados-Membros, com um objectivo comum: pôr cobro a este surto o mais rapidamente possível. A todas as partes interessadas reitero que situações como esta não são um problema local: são um problema da União Europeia.
Além disso, este acordo reflectiria a capacidade das instituições europeias para cooperarem de forma responsável e sem demoras, numa altura em que a Europa precisa muito disso.
Além disso, este instrumento não substituiria o direito dos contratos dos Estados-Membros, contribuiria apenas para uma melhor escolha do modelo contratual entre as partes, graças a exemplos baseados em princípios gerais, definições e regulamentos-tipo para contratos comerciais e celebrados com consumidores, sem contrariar os princípios da subsidiariedade e da proporcionalidade.
Além disso, está para além da minha compreensão a razão por que nem sequer foi possível esperar pelo veredicto da Organização Mundial do Comércio a respeito do presente regulamento.
Além disso, existe uma proposta de ligar o financiamento da União Europeia aos maiores desafios que a sociedade enfrenta, como as alterações climáticas. O objectivo seria utilizar o financiamento da União Europeia como uma alavanca para captar mais investimento privado, por exemplo no campo da inovação em tecnologias verdes.
Além disso, ficou também claro que o sistema europeu de gestão de crises tem pontos fracos assinaláveis no caso de crises alimentares.
Além disso, foi possível incluir uma cláusula de reapreciação que permite remover os obstáculos que se colocam ao bom funcionamento do mercado interno. Não obstante algumas dificuldades iniciais, foi possível chegar a um entendimento entre as três instituições europeias, o que se traduz num resultado muito satisfatório. O Conselho poderá, pois, aprovar rapidamente esta legislação, tendo em vista a sua entrada em vigor a partir de Janeiro de 2012, o que muito beneficiaria os consumidores.
Além disso, foram acrescentadas subitamente mais quatro novas acusações ao seu processo. O juiz chegou a insinuar que estas acusações poderiam resultar num novo mandado de detenção. O senhor Disselkoen pagou novamente uma soma avultada de fiança e regressou aos Países Baixos, mas este caso demonstra que o Mandado de Detenção Europeu pode conduzir a situações degradantes.
Além disso, gostaria de explicar que, nos próximos meses, estarei igualmente preocupado em elaborar regulamentação jurídica rigorosa e objectiva em matéria de resíduos nucleares.
Além disso, gostaria de salientar a estreita ligação existente entre a situação de desvantagem socioeconómica e as oportunidades de educar e ensinar as crianças a partir de tenra idade, porque existe uma menor probabilidade de as famílias com baixos rendimentos utilizarem os serviços de cuidados e educação na primeira infância (CEPI). Consequentemente, mais tarde, alguns destes jovens não obtêm emprego, nem estão inseridos nos sistemas de educação ou formação. Compreendo os esforços da Comissão para incentivar os Estados-Membros a realizarem um intercâmbio de exemplos de boas políticas e práticas, recorrendo ao método aberto de coordenação, mas seria muito mais útil e eficaz definir e adoptar critérios de qualidade comuns.
Além disso, gostaria de salientar aqui aquele que é, na minha opinião, o aspecto mais importante do acordo alcançado com o Conselho, nomeadamente, o compromisso por parte da Comissão Europeia de apresentar, até 30 de Setembro de 2013, depois de ter realizado um estudo de impacto adequado, um relatório acompanhado por propostas legislativas relativas à indicação da rotulagem de origem, rastreabilidade e utilização de novas tecnologias.
Além disso, gostaríamos de questionar a Comissão sobre a possibilidade de abrir uma delegação da União Europeia em Oulan-Bator, num futuro próximo.
Além disso, há uma crise de confiança da parte do público.
Além disso, institucionaliza o Semestre Europeu através da necessidade de um envolvimento de todas as instituições europeias em que os programas de reformas nacionais devem incorporar os objectivos da UE. Quero também sublinhar que pretende alargar o mecanismo de votação invertida por maioria qualificada no Conselho em todas as fases do procedimento de avaliação, exame e acompanhamento do PEC e dos programas de convergência nacionais.
Além disso, isto comprometeria ainda mais o último vestígio de supervisão e controlo que os Estados-Membros exercem sobre a fúria gastadora das instituições europeias.
Além disso, muitas vezes recusam-se a mover uma eventual acção noutro Estado-Membro. A nova abrangência da proposta de directiva parece oferecer uma possível solução para as dificuldades que têm surgido, uma vez que, para além da introdução de muitas variações sectoriais, a directiva estaria limitada a contemplar principalmente os contratos celebrados fora do estabelecimento comercial, que compõem a maior parte das transacções transfronteiriças. Por isso, penso que é conveniente aplicar uma abordagem que vise uma harmonização direccionada, completa e extensiva, limitada a aspectos específicos de certos contratos, mantendo um nível elevado de protecção do consumidor.
Além disso, na Irlanda, o sector do transporte rodoviário de mercadorias emprega mais de 30 000 pessoas. O pior é que estas novas imposições vão aumentar os custos do transporte das exportações irlandesas para os mercados europeus.
Além disso, na última década, o número de mortes relacionadas com a droga tem vindo a aumentar gradualmente.
Além disso, neste caso, este cidadão da Arábia Saudita enfrenta a pena de morte imposta por uma comissão militar, embora em 2009, o relator especial da ONU sobre execuções extrajudiciais tenha solicitado especificamente aos Estados Unidos que não submetessem processos passíveis de pena capital a comissões militares.
Além disso, no capítulo dos direitos de propriedade intelectual, as indicações geográficas são um importante domínio de interesse para a UE. É importante obter, nesta negociação, um resultado político que permita a protecção efectiva das principais Indicações Geográficas da UE. Até à data, as negociações têm revelado ser difíceis.
Além disso, no que diz respeito às categorias de produtos não sujeitas a restrições quantitativas das importações e introduzidas em livre prática na UE, está a ser aplicado um sistema de vigilância estatística ex post para monitorizar o impacto das mesmas no mercado da UE. Também gostaria de salientar que em 2010, o Parlamento Europeu adoptou, em primeira leitura, o relatório da senhora deputada Muscardini sobre a indicação do país de origem de determinados produtos importados de países terceiros ("Fabricado em"), que também diz respeito aos têxteis e ao vestuário.
Além disso, não estamos satisfeitos, porque acreditamos que os testes de stress, que, de facto, vão ser realizados pelos próprios operadores, devem ser submetidos a uma segunda opinião, a fim de garantir uma maior objectividade. O método da avaliação pelos pares, envolvendo seis especialistas, é um passo em frente.
Além disso, não há poder protector que consiga derrubá-lo. Não obstante, certamente que uma mudança de regime em Damasco teria consequências de longo alcance para toda a região. Os primeiros refugiados sírios a chegar à Turquia constituem talvez a vanguarda de um significativo afluxo de pessoas que procuram escapar ao conflito.
Além disso, não há provas irrefutáveis de que seja mesmo necessária uma normalização. Em caso de dúvida, apoio o princípio da subsidiariedade, pelo que voto contra o relatório Wallis.
Além disso, não nos foram dadas respostas relativamente a nenhuma de várias dezenas de perguntas específicas, incluindo perguntas relativas ao financiamento do Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa, criado em finais de 2009 (o relatório Rivellini contém uma lista completa de perguntas). Se recordarmos as dificuldades que se verificaram durante os debates sobre as despesas do Conselho em 2007 e 2008, bem como as cedências muito significativas feitas pelo Parlamento nesse contexto, a posição assumida este ano é compreensível.
Além disso, não obstante os progressos feitos nos últimos anos, a participação das pequenas e médias empresas no Programa-Quadro deve ser reforçada, a fim de desenvolver as competências que lhes permitam aumentar a sua competitividade.
Além disso, não podemos proibir o Paquistão, através deste regulamento, de implementar medidas coerentes com as suas obrigações internacionais.
Além disso, não queria deixar de chamar a atenção para os acontecimentos das últimas semanas no sector das frutas e dos produtos hortícolas que demonstram claramente a necessidade de a nova PAC proporcionar instrumentos de reacção às crises para todos os sectores, instrumentos que sejam eficazes, eficientes e adequados às necessidades de cada sector específico.
Além disso, não se pode considerar que o papel da NATO interessa apenas aos Estados-Membros que dela fazem parte, como afirma o relatório Gualtieri: a NATO gera segurança também para os Estados-Membros da UE que não são membros da NATO.
Além disso, o EGNOS é utilizado diariamente por 80 000 agricultores europeus e foi recentemente certificado para utilização no sector da aviação civil, sendo que a sua certificação para utilização no sector do transporte marítimo deverá ter lugar num futuro próximo. A política espacial e o programa GNSS revestem-se de importância estratégica e devem proporcionar benefícios tangíveis para os cidadãos e as empresas.
Além disso, o Governo húngaro demonstrou o seu apoio à criação de uma representação da Região de Székely em Bruxelas, o que constitui uma grande afronta à integridade territorial dos romenos e da Roménia.
Além disso, o Japão é o sétimo destino das exportações europeias. A prossecução do nosso diálogo com o Japão é uma medida absolutamente positiva.
Além disso, o Parlamento Europeu gostaria que o novo quadro financeiro fosse estruturado de forma a aumentar a competitividade e a promover a integração social. O orçamento da UE financia medidas que são absolutamente vitais para os cidadãos de todos os Estados-Membros.
Além disso, o acordo alcançado com o Parlamento Europeu oferece também incentivos no que respeita aos veículos menos poluentes das classes de emissão Euro V e VI, a fim de promover a renovação da frota de veículos.
Além disso, o acordo deve ter igualmente em consideração o resultado da reforma da política agrícola comum. É importante clarificar o capítulo relativo ao desenvolvimento sustentável. A UE estabeleceu as suas normas ambientais de acordo com as exigências dos Estados-Membros.
Além disso, o casamento e os valores familiares, na vertente em que são definidos, ultrapassam a realidade dos cidadãos que vivem na Europa e na Hungria e não se enquadram na norma de diversidade europeia.
Além disso, o custo do apoio aos países mais fracos aumenta constantemente.
Além disso, o desenvolvimento económico promoveu a estabilidade política em toda a região. Estas preferências comerciais foram concedidas durante o período que terminava em 31 de Dezembro de 2010 e aplicam-se actualmente à Bósnia-Herzegovina, à Sérvia e ao Kosovo.
Além disso, o documento que hoje aprovámos encoraja igualmente a introdução da marcação de origem, o que facilitará a escolha do consumidor e contribuirá para reduzir marcas de origem falsas ou enganosas. A este respeito, apoio a alteração que estabelece a exigência de que os fabricantes indiquem na etiqueta a presença de partes não têxteis de origem animal.
Além disso, o estatuto social ou a situação financeira de uma pessoa não devem limitar o seu aceso às oportunidades de viajar para o estrangeiro.
Além disso, o facto de o instrumento legal ter sido criado sob a forma de um regulamento melhorará a segurança jurídica neste domínio.
Além disso, o facto de todos os ministros europeus dos Negócios Estrangeiros sentirem actualmente a necessidade de correr uma vez à volta da Praça de Tahrir levando a sua bandeira nacional constitui um grave problema.
Além disso, o financiamento da ajuda europeia ao desenvolvimento tem de ser adequado. A União Europeia assumiu o compromisso de, até 2015, destinar 0,7% do seu rendimento nacional bruto (RNB) à ajuda pública ao desenvolvimento (APD), o que significa que o montante actual do auxílio europeu vai aumentar.
Além disso, o nível de participação em particular das pequenas e médias empresas mantém-se relativamente fraco. A situação poderia ser melhorada através da simplificação das regras administrativas e financeiras.
Além disso, o número de candidaturas apresentadas ao Fundo e, por conseguinte, o montante global solicitado, aumentou significativamente nos últimos dois anos, o que dificulta ainda mais a identificação de margens suficientes de onde obter contribuições. Isso é um problema. A aprovação pela Comissão das candidaturas ao Fundo em 2011 teve, pela primeira vez, de ser adiada, porque não foi possível obter rapidamente dotações para pagamento suficientes.
Além disso, o objectivo da Comissão também é reforçar a uniformidade das regras de importação através do alinhamento das regras relativas à importação de têxteis com as de outros bens industriais, o que deve melhorar a coerência global do enquadramento legal neste domínio. A Comissão considera que as medidas de política comercial muito limitadas no sector têxtil aplicadas pela União podem ser geridas sem que seja imposto o encargo excessivo da apresentação da prova de origem para todas as importações. Isto também ajuda a prevenir o problema das distorções de mercado que seriam provocadas por um aumento das importações desses produtos têxteis para o mercado da União Europeia, caso as quotas autorizadas não fossem respeitadas.
Além disso, o pacote "Clima e Energia" contém três mecanismos específicos para equilibrar os custos globais nos Estados-Membros, de modo a que os esforços sejam partilhados de forma justa e equitativa.
Além disso, o pedido de alargamento da votação invertida por maioria qualificada constitui uma prova adicional da vontade deste Parlamento de agir e de responder à crise.
Além disso, o presente relatório vai ajudar a clarificar e a simplificar o processamento dos vários acordos em matéria de aviação, indicando os critérios aos quais devemos prestar atenção e os aspectos que devemos acompanhar. O relatório irá ainda ajudar a determinar como avançar com os acordos aéreos e as etapas que será necessário cumprir à medida que as diversas instituições os forem abordando.
Além disso, o princípio foi estabelecido de modo a permitir que os Estados-Membros determinem a utilização a dar às receitas das portagens cobradas, sendo que pelo menos 15% terão de ser utilizadas no apoio financeiro a projectos da RTE-T, o que garantirá uma maior sustentabilidade dos transportes.
Além disso, o que ocorreu foi totalmente desproporcionado. Não iria tão longe como o senhor deputado Schulz, que apelidou a situação de problema marginal - 27 000 tunisinos não constituem um problema marginal - mas ele está certo quando diz que, em comparação com, por exemplo, as 350 000 pessoas que fugiram do Kosovo durante a guerra, não estamos obviamente a falar de um tsunami migratório.
Além disso, o relatório exorta a UE a renovar a dinâmica imprimida ao processo de adesão da Turquia à UE, um aspecto relativamente ao qual nunca estive minimamente de acordo. A Turquia tem de ficar fora da nossa organização, porque não pertence nem nunca pertencerá à Europa.
Além disso, o relatório frisa a necessidade de medir a qualidade de vida nas sociedades, considerando que alcançar e sustentar a qualidade de vida envolve factores importantes e consensuais como a saúde, a educação, a cultura, o emprego, a habitação e as condições ambientais. O relatório também apoia plenamente a criação de um quadro jurídico sólido para as contas económicas do ambiente da União Europeia como um passo positivo no processo "O PIB e mais além" e, com efeito, saúda a iniciativa da Comissão de conceber um índice de pressão ambiental, a apresentar juntamente com o PIB.
Além disso, o relatório procura criar um contexto geral para a protecção das florestas, nomeadamente a subsidiariedade, a diversidade das ameaças de acordo com os diferentes tipos de floresta, o papel fundamental da gestão sustentável das florestas e a importância das florestas para a competitividade e o emprego.
Além disso, o relatório recomenda um conjunto de critérios para avaliar o conteúdo dos acordos, incluindo o acesso equilibrado ao mercado e oportunidades de investimento, assim como condições de concorrência equitativas no que respeita a subvenções públicas e normas sociais e ambientais.
Além disso, o senhor prometeu que, quando avaliar a auditoria de desempenho, estabelecerá padrões claros; trata-se, de qualquer forma, de uma obrigação que lhe cabe no âmbito do Tratado de Lisboa.
Além disso, o texto salienta a necessidade de rastreabilidade dos produtos têxteis, e a Comissão irá encomendar um estudo sobre os potenciais perigos para a saúde de produtos como corantes e fibras sintéticas.
Além disso, os Estados-Membros poderão determinar a utilização a dar às receitas arrecadadas das portagens, porém, pelo menos, 15% dessas receitas terão que ser utilizadas para apoiar financeiramente projectos das RTE-T, a fim de aumentar a sustentabilidade dos transportes.
Além disso, os EstadosMembros concordaram em introduzir, a nível individual, legislação própria sobre regras orçamentais: não necessariamente as normas de disciplina orçamental da Constituição alemã, mas regras específicas, à medida do país, que promovam eficazmente o cumprimento das suas obrigações nos termos do Tratado.
Além disso, os bósnios caracterizam-se pela sua grande simpatia e hospitalidade.
Além disso, os dados em matéria de ambiente disponíveis até à data devem ser enriquecidos a médio prazo para facilitar a necessária avaliação da política ambiental europeia.
Além disso, os dados poderiam ser mais facilmente monitorizados se estivessem disponíveis informações de alta qualidade sobre a interacção entre factores económicos e ambientais: as contas económicas do ambiente podem contribuir para a avaliação das políticas, fornecendo dados relativos ao impacto ambiental das actividades económicas.
Além disso, os estudantes com famílias (por exemplo, com filhos) devem também receber apoio adicional para fazerem face aos desafios específicos que se colocarão ao participarem na mobilidade educativa. A mobilidade de qualidade é fundamental para a realização de uma aprendizagem intercultural, do desenvolvimento pessoal e do multilinguismo por parte dos jovens. A tónica é colocada no emprego como resultado final e este é, de facto, um problema ligado à educação, mas também à participação da juventude e à cidadania activa.
Além disso, os outros dois problemas manter-se-iam: em primeiro lugar, a sobrepesca iria de facto aumentar e, em segundo lugar, não se resolveria o problema dos preços de mercado.
Além disso, os resultados obtidos irão convencer a Europa do êxito alcançado em matéria de reforço da segurança de toda a União.
Além disso, os senhores não podem ignorar o papel da Goldman Sachs na especulação actual com a dívida soberana, nem as suas responsabilidades na crise económica e financeira, assim como as investigações em curso nos Estados Unidos. O facto de a Goldman Sachs aparecer no CV do senhor Draghi coloca-o fora daquilo que é razoável, desqualificando-o, assim, para este cargo.
Além disso, os seus maiores beneficiários são candidatos dos chamados antigos Estados-Membros da UE: Alemanha (23,1% de todo o financiamento concedido), Espanha (19,1%), Reino Unido (9,9%) e Países Baixos (8,3%). Hoje, cerca de um terço da investigação é financiada ao abrigo do mecanismo.
Além disso, os sistemas globais de navegação por satélite devem proporcionar a interoperabilidade com sistemas diferentes, incluindo os sistemas tradicionais. O alargamento da cobertura do EGNOS (Serviço Europeu Complementar de Navegação Geoestacionário) deveria ser uma prioridade.
Além disso, os trabalhadores empregados ilegalmente não ousam contactar as autoridades para pedir protecção, reivindicar os seus direitos ou o acesso aos serviços de saúde, pois receiam ser reenviados para o seu país de origem e/ou um castigo por parte dos seus empregadores.
Além disso, para combater o desemprego de trabalhadores pouco qualificados e promover o emprego de cidadãos idosos, é imperioso promover o reconhecimento das qualificações nacionais entre Estados-Membros e incentivar a certificação através da validação de competências adquiridas em estágios informais.
Além disso, para reforçar a supervisão orçamental, um sistema de controlo do cumprimento deve ser composto não apenas por um sistema de multas (sanções), mas também de incentivos, reforçando assim o papel do Parlamento Europeu e dos parlamentos nacionais.
Além disso, penso que devemos dar maior importância às desvantagens naturais, como o aquecimento global, a geografia montanhosa e a escassez de recursos hídricos, na atribuição da assistência. A seca que estamos a atravessar põe em evidência a necessidade urgente de a PAC incluir recursos práticos que permitam aos nossos agricultores fazer face ao problema da escassez de recursos hídricos.
Além disso, penso que, se um Estado-Membro pretender igualmente alargar o âmbito de aplicação do direito europeu a transacções nacionais, deve ser livre de o fazer. É absolutamente verdadeiro dizer que esta não é a solução para todos os problemas.
Além disso, poderá dizer-nos que iniciativas a senhora baronesa e a UE tencionam promover para garantir que o Governo israelita entregue as receitas fiscais devidas à Autoridade Palestiniana?
Além disso, previu-se a possibilidade de fazer depender a taxa de portagem do volume de trânsito dos veículos (congestionamento rodoviário) nos períodos de ponta -, embora sem exceder o máximo de cinco horas por dia.
Além disso, propus que fôssemos mais ambiciosos e disséssemos que a União Europeia deveria libertar 1 200 MHz nas bandas de 1,5 GHz e 2,3 GHz, e que deveríamos também lançar o debate sobre a banda de 700 MHz - pois, se não começarmos já, não teremos oportunidade de tomar decisões no futuro -, e deveríamos ainda utilizar a banda de 5 GHz para a utilização comum e isenta de licença de todas as comunicações móveis da Internet a curta distância.
Além disso, põe os trabalhadores em situação de desvantagem, cria insegurança nos empregados e reduz o apoio financeiro para os que perdem os seus empregos.
Além disso, reiterámos o nosso apoio a uma Internet livre, condenando a censura de que é objecto e a ameaça que isso representa para os direitos humanos e para o acesso e partilha do património cultural de todo o mundo.
Além disso, requer-se um Livro Branco sobre a protecção florestal, abordando recursos financeiros, intercâmbio de conhecimentos e promoção da investigação. 3. Reconhece-se a importância das florestas para o desenvolvimento rural e a necessidade de eliminar obstáculos ao financiamento da silvicultura e da biodiversidade.
Além disso, saudamos o facto de uma proposta de directiva recente da Comissão e do Conselho relativa ao direito de informação nos processos penais prever o direito à informação escrita no processo do Mandado de Detenção Europeu.
Além disso, se pretendemos alcançar o objectivo do Conselho de Barcelona que estipula que os Estados-Membros da UE devem assegurar estruturas de acolhimento para pelo menos 90% das crianças entre os três anos e a idade de entrada obrigatória na escola e para pelo menos 33% das crianças com menos de três anos, é necessário haver acordo entre os Estados-Membros e, se possível, um intercâmbio de informação e de melhores práticas, especialmente entre Estados-Membros com estruturas de educação pré-escolar muito desenvolvidas e outros com menos experiência nesse sector.
Além disso, seis Estados-Membros da UE foram capazes de manter um excedente primário de mais de 4% durante, pelo menos, quatro anos, o que mostra que isso não é impossível. É seguramente um desafio muito grande, mas já foi feito antes e pode ser feito também no caso da Grécia se houver vontade política e unidade no país. Esta é a única maneira de a Grécia evitar alternativas muito piores.
Além disso, serão certamente efectuados investimentos, em colaboração com o Senhor Comissário Oettinger, no sector das infra-estruturas necessárias para as redes transeuropeias no domínio do abastecimento de energia.
Além disso, solicito à Senhora Vice-Presidente da Comissão e Alta Representante que, quando iniciar ou abrir essa investigação sobre a situação no Campo Ashraf, investigue também as violações dos direitos humanos cometidos contra a população pelos Mujahedin, que foram testemunhadas e documentadas por organizações como a Human Rights Watch.
Além disso, são penalizados com tarifas de roaming quando tentam telefonar para casa ou aceder à Internet para procurar informação básica e necessária. O roaming de dados é muitíssimo dispendioso.
Além disso, também em termos económicos, a livre circulação é crucial para o sucesso do mercado único e dos esforços continuados da Europa no sentido de estimular o crescimento e o emprego.
Além disso, tendo em vista o objectivo de ajudar as PME a expandir as suas actividades transfronteiriças, cumpre facilitar o processo de recuperação de dívidas transfronteiras e adoptar, o quanto antes, o estatuto da sociedade privada europeia.
Além disso, tenho de dizer que este acréscimo não implica qualquer aumento dos orçamentos da União Europeia. A sua aplicação tem de assegurar também a sustentabilidade ambiental e social e não deve distorcer a concorrência entre os Estados-Membros.
Além disso, todos nós sabemos que os controlos internos podem esporadicamente revelar-se úteis mas não fazem parte de uma abordagem construtiva da integração europeia, nem representam uma solução rentável a longo prazo para monitorizar a circulação e fazer face à pressão da imigração. E sempre assim foi. O facto é que quando confrontado com uma chegada maciça de migrantes, nenhum Estado-Membro ficará, em última instância, em melhor situação se optar por resolver a questão sozinho. Só se os Estados-Membros enfrentarem juntos a situação é que será possível encontrar uma solução duradoura.
Além disso, trata-se de uma decisão extremamente cínica, pois é muito provável que a União Europeia se veja obrigada, de qualquer maneira, a compensar o défice financeiro.
Além disso, trata-se de uma resposta errada às tensões causadas pela crise económica e às suas consequências sociais. A UDMR considera que necessitamos de uma Europa forte, que poderá surgir através de uma maior solidariedade e da rejeição cabal do proteccionismo interno e do populismo.
Além disso, um instrumento opcional não deve nem harmonizar nem substituir os direitos nacionais dos contratos, devendo antes trabalhar a par com estes enquanto instrumento alternativo que oferece liberdade de escolha às partes contratantes.
Além disso, um nível justo de protecção social, com um seguro de desemprego, doença e velhice, tem de ser uma prática normalizada também para quem trabalha no sector criativo.
Além disso, vamos ter de assegurar que os Estados-Membros cumprem o compromisso que assumiram de investir as receitas em projectos sustentáveis.
Além disso, verifica-se uma ausência de progressos adequados nos planos dos contratos de direito público e dos serviços, da definição de princípios para a protecção dos direitos de propriedade intelectual, incluindo as indicações geográficas, das condições para um desenvolvimento sustentável e, em particular, do acompanhamento das normas de produção quando da criação de condições de concorrência equitativas.
Além disso, é inaceitável o facto de esta abordagem penalizar os Estados-Membros geograficamente mais periféricos, sejam eles países de origem, de partida ou de destino das mercadorias, em benefício dos países "centrais" e de trânsito.
Além disso, é inegável, para além do caso da CEPOL, que um certo número de agências da UE com campos de intervenção comuns estão a realizar actividades semelhantes ou complementares a partir de sedes espalhadas por toda a Europa. A Comissão deve, portanto, avaliar a possibilidade de fundir as agências que desenvolvam actividades que se sobreponham ou que sejam complementares.
Além disso, é muito importante zelar por que todos os Estados-Membros possuam controlos rigorosos e eficazes nas fronteiras externas.
Além disso, é necessário introduzir critérios de referência claros quanto ao respeito normas democráticas por parte da Rússia, que contribuirão para aprofundar as relações com a UE. Por último, não devemos esquecer o apoio que é necessário dar ao desenvolvimento da sociedade civil, como garante de uma democracia conforme com as normas e que também seja verdadeiramente inclusiva.
Além disso, é necessário um apoio adicional à cooperação transnacional e fronteiriça, fundamental do ponto de vista do desenvolvimento e da convergência europeia e para a concretização de projectos regionais comuns no domínio das infra-estruturas e do ambiente.
Além disso, é necessário um maior envolvimento dos actores não estatais na política multilateral, para promover e facilitar uma consulta melhorada de organizações da sociedade civil e dos parceiros sociais nas futuras estruturas de governação de organizações internacionais. A União Europeia deverá desempenhar um papel activo e de liderança na reforma da governação mundial, reforçando a cooperação, melhorando as instituições e levando todas as partes a cooperarem.
Além disso, é preciso que asseguremos uma melhor coordenação da ajuda ao desenvolvimento com os Estados-Membros e também que sejamos capazes de implementar, de uma vez por todas, a integração da totalidade do orçamento da ajuda ao desenvolvimento no orçamento da UE, porque é incompreensível que apenas uma parte da nossa ajuda ao desenvolvimento esteja incluída no orçamento da UE.
Além disso, é referido que Sarajevo ocupa um lugar especial na história e cultura europeias, que em 2014 comemorará vários aniversários importantes, e que a Câmara Municipal de Sarajevo e operadores locais no domínio da cultura já empreenderam grandes preparativos para a sua candidatura a este título.
Além do mais, tem havido problemas relacionados com conflitos de interesses dos peritos e do restante pessoal da EMEA.
Além dos benefícios obtidos pela poupança de recursos e pela utilização da complementaridade, isto iria simplificar tanto a utilização dos fundos pelos beneficiários como a gestão dos mesmos pelas autoridades nacionais.
Amanhã, iremos votar um importante regulamento que permitirá à Comissão tomar novas medidas na matéria. É muito importante que este sector se possa expandir e trazer benefícios para os investidores europeus e indianos.
Amanhã, realizar-se-á uma reunião especial em Viena, no âmbito do Conselho Permanente da OSCE. O Ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros e do Comércio da Mongólia dirigirá a palavra aos Estados-Membros.
Ambas as decisões são erradas, no entanto, por causa das limitações de tempo, entre outras razões, pretendo concentrar-se apenas na questão de mérito, não sem antes manifestar o meu total apoio à intervenção do senhor deputado Vital Moreira.
Ambas as dimensões foram inseridas no quadro institucional, juridicamente vinculativo, dos princípios da UE (democracia, Estado de direito, universalidade e indivisibilidade dos direitos humanos e das liberdades fundamentais, respeito pela dignidade humana, princípios de igualdade e solidariedade, respeito pelos princípios da Carta das Nações Unidas e pelos princípios do direito internacional, incluindo a responsabilidade de protecção), tendo sido os seus objectivos fundidos com os objectivos gerais da acção externa da UE.
Ambas as iniciativas testemunham a importância elevada que a Comissão do Comércio Internacional e, a nosso ver, o Parlamento também devem atribuir a esta questão.
Ambas as partes devem despender todos os esforços para concluir um ACL abrangente, ambicioso e equilibrado até ao final de 2011. O acordo dever respeitar susceptibilidades relacionadas com o comércio de produtos agrícolas, mas isto não deve impedir a abertura do mercado em áreas de complementaridade. A Comissão deve ter em devida consideração todos os possíveis impactos negativos na agricultura europeia, especialmente nas áreas da abertura dos mercados, OGM, leite, carne de bovino, protecção da propriedade intelectual e rotulagem da origem. A Comissão deve igualmente negociar sistemas eficazes e transparentes de adjudicação de contratos e a Índia deve aplicar procedimentos transparentes e leais no contexto da adjudicação de contratos públicos, assim como conceder às empresas europeias o acesso aos sistemas de adjudicação de contratos públicos.
Ambas as partes esperam tirar benefícios significativos da eliminação dos direitos aduaneiros, da liberalização do comércio de serviços e da criação de novas empresas, e reafirmam o seu empenhamento em reduções pautais e numa maior liberalização da criação de empresas e do comércio de serviços. O acesso ao mercado está a ser prejudicado por barreiras não pautais ao comércio, como, por exemplo, requisitos sanitários e de segurança ou entraves técnicos, restrições quantitativas, procedimentos de conformidade, mecanismos de defesa comercial, procedimentos alfandegários, impostos nacionais e a não adopção de regras e normas internacionais. A União Europeia e a Índia têm de se comprometer a acelerar as conversações sobre o ACL e a obter progressos substanciais e úteis, tendo em vista a rápida conclusão de um acordo de comércio e de investimento ambicioso, equilibrado e abrangente.
Ambas as situações são intoleráveis, e os senhores, enquanto deputados a este Parlamento, deveriam combatê-las.
Ambos os parceiros têm interesse em utilizá-lo da melhor maneira possível.
Ambos os países estão a pôr em prática programas muito ambiciosos de consolidação orçamental, reforma estrutural e reestruturação financeira. A nossa missão de revisão está, neste momento, em Atenas com o BCE e o FMI para avaliar a execução do programa e preparar uma análise actualizada da sustentabilidade da dívida grega.
Ambos os projectos têm problemas semelhantes.
Amplia-se e reforça-se a aplicação de sanções e o pagamento de multas pelos Estados que não cumpram as imposições. Trata-se de uma ingerência inadmissível, que coloca os Estados-Membros sujeitos a este procedimento relativo aos défices excessivos numa posição de autêntica submissão, de cariz colonial, perante as potências europeias.
Analisadas as causas da recente crise financeira, revela-se necessário encontrar mecanismos de controlo do risco de investimento, da composição dos Conselhos de Administração e da remuneração dos administradores e, bem assim, promover o reforço da cooperação entre entidades de supervisão, públicas e privadas, garantindo a sua independência.
Analisarei agora brevemente os motivos pelos quais nós, na Finlândia, estamos hesitantes em apoiar Portugal.
Analisei o relatório com a máxima atenção e resumi os pontos principais: (1) as áreas de incidência (não apenas uma análise da relação custo/benefício, mas uma abordagem integrada); (2) a inclusão das partes interessadas de todas as áreas, embora a metodologia e o controlo de qualidade final devam continuar sob a alçada das instituições europeias, com um período de consulta alargado de 8 para 12 semanas.; (3) a revisão da abordagem comum interinstitucional com o objectivo de encorajar todas as instituições a aplicarem uma metodologia comum às AI. Potencial para melhoria a nível da Comissão: (1) reforço do controlo do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho sobre o Comité das Avaliações de Impacto; (2) avaliação ex post sistemática da legislação em vigor e uma análise da jurisprudência aplicável do Tribunal de Justiça Europeu.
Analiso estes factores com maior profundidade no projecto de relatório sobre a contribuição das políticas europeias em matéria de igualdade entre homens e mulheres para o combate à delinquência juvenil.
Anima-me ver que também a Índia está a fazer verdadeiros progressos no sentido de procurar lidar com uma série de questões, incluindo, em especial, as barreiras não pautais. É muito encorajante ver como o actual Governo indiano está a enfrentar os problemas de corrupção, ao ponto de mandar prender o Chefe dos Jogos da Commonwealth, e a dar resposta às questões das barreiras não tarifárias.
Anteriormente, existiam, obviamente, controlos nas fronteiras internas, mas isso devia-se à realização de determinados acontecimentos, tais como acontecimentos desportivos, o Campeonato Europeu de Futebol, competições mundiais ou algumas conferências das cimeiras.
Anteriormente, teríamos classificado os membros dos governos da Rússia e da Ucrânia como amigos, mas a maneira como a Rússia está neste momento a agir para com a Ucrânia está longe de ser justa. O mesmo se aplica ao seu comportamento em relação a alguns fornecedores de energia, e também o vimos no Turquemenistão. Por conseguinte, temos de tornar bem claro à Rússia que queremos uma parceria baseada na igualdade e em interesses comuns. O nosso objectivo tem de ser, decididamente, estabelecer uma parceria genuína e activa.
Antes da Páscoa, alguns deputados pertencentes à Comissão da Indústria, da Investigação e da Energia deslocaram-se à Califórnia para ver como funciona o investimento em Silicon Valley. O que descobrimos foi que o capital de risco estava muito mais disponível do que na Europa, e que aqueles que o forneciam adoptavam uma abordagem mais arriscada.
Antes da publicação dos resultados, os Estados-Membros terão de divulgar estratégias para uma eventual reestruturação ou recapitalização das respectivas instituições vulneráveis.
Antes de começarmos a promover estas culturas fora do espaço europeu, até nós mesmos temos de querer familiarizar-nos com todos esses elementos culturais que são característicos da Europa. A este respeito, considero que os cidadãos da União Europeia são os melhores embaixadores das culturas da Europa. A única condição é que lhes seja proporcionada de antemão a possibilidade de se informarem da forma mais simples possível sobre a riqueza cultural da zona onde vivem.
Antes de darmos início ao debate, gostaria de dizer umas breves palavras.
Antes de mais, deveriam ser completamente independentes e transparentes.
Antes de mais, gostaria de chamar a atenção para a importância de prestar aos consumidores uma informação que seja precisa e relevante, mas sobretudo compreensível e uniforme, sobre os componentes dos produtos têxteis: uma informação exaustiva de nada serve se, depois, o público não conseguir decifrá-la. Conseguimos dar um passo em frente que é necessário, mas não é suficiente: temos de ir mais longe e de proteger os cidadãos que são mais vulneráveis.
Antes de mais, quero começar por agradecer ao Senhor Audy pelo trabalho que desenvolveu e pela magnífica colaboração que teve com todos nós, em todos os grupos, e pela abertura que demonstrou ao longo deste processo.
Antes de mais, temos de avaliar as possibilidades oferecidas pelo Tratado: através de uma cooperação estruturada permanente e com base no artigo 44º, que oferece a possibilidade de delegar a tarefa de desenvolver uma missão a determinados Estados-Membros, mas dentro do quadro processual da UE, o que não é a mesma coisa que renacionalização. Precisamos de fazer uso das estruturas já existentes - a começar pelo Serviço Europeu de Acção Externa - e fixarmo-nos tarefas ambiciosas em matéria de capacidades.
Antes de mais, um lembrete explícito do valor acrescentado da cooperação territorial europeia e do seu potencial para aumentar a competitividade.
Antes de procedermos à votação do relatório, gostaria de salientar que as actividades em curso do grupo de trabalho sobre o código de conduta para os deputados e os grupos de interesse não prevê questionar o conteúdo do acordo com a Comissão e o conteúdo do relatório Casini.
Antes de terminar, gostaria de me debruçar sucintamente sobre duas outras questões. A primeira tem a ver com referências a proibições de determinados produtos.
Antevejo um enorme potencial para as ICC, especialmente tendo em conta a cooperação possível e necessária com universidades, centros de investigação e escolas de arte, com os quais podemos criar uma rede de programas conjuntos de formação e de aprendizagem ao longo da vida. É importante e mesmo crucial, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, disseminar práticas e know-how e melhorar a aprendizagem através de programas de formação profissional específicos para o sector cultural e criativo.
Ao Conselho, devo dizer que, se esta questão não é problema para o Conselho porque os representantes de grupos de interesses têm muito pouca influência nele, então devia ser fácil o Conselho aprovar o registo em matéria de transparência.
Ao abrigo das normas de identificação electrónica dos animais (IDEA), multam-se os criadores por incorrecção dos dados, apesar das deficiências graves de que a tecnologia enferma. Já expus o problema à Comissão em inúmeras ocasiões, assim como muitos outros representantes de EstadosMembros.
Ao abrigo do Tratado de Lisboa, a UE dispõe de melhores e aperfeiçoadas soluções para a sua representação externa, e a cooperação com a ONU e outras organizações internacionais é tão desejável como necessária no que se refere à gestão de crises, à manutenção e à consolidação da paz e à resposta aos desafios internacionais, como no caso dos acontecimentos recentes no Japão.
Ao abrigo do Tratado de Lisboa, foram criadas novas estruturas permanentes para a representação externa da UE, embora esta nova dimensão não permita ainda à União participar, a uma só voz e por direito próprio, no trabalho de muitos organismos internacionais.
Ao abrigo do segundo pilar, os pequenos agricultores poderiam também receber um apoio significativo para a reestruturação ou para poderem prestar um maior contributo a nível territorial, bem como no plano económico, ao tornarem-se mais rentáveis e mais competitivos.
Ao adoptar esta proposta de directiva, que substitui quatro directivas por uma só, esperamos melhorar a regulamentação em matéria de protecção dos consumidores e garantir um nível mínimo de protecção para todos.
Ao adoptar normas laborais, a UE está a apoiar a oportunidade de homens e mulheres conseguirem um trabalho digno e produtivo, em condições de liberdade, igualdade, segurança e dignidade.
Ao adoptar o relatório sobre a proposta de directiva relativa à gestão do combustível irradiado e dos resíduos radioactivos, o Parlamento está a mostrar que é especialmente sensível a esta questão e a manifestar um desejo claro de encontrar soluções definitivas comuns para a armazenagem de resíduos nucleares na Europa.
Ao apoiar o relatório sobre a Agenda Urbana Europeia e a sua Futura Política de Coesão, estou a defender uma nova abordagem da política urbana, baseada numa cooperação estreita entre operadores nos diferentes níveis de tomada de decisões: UE, nível nacional, áreas urbanas e áreas urbanas periféricas. O facto de os senhores deputados com tais ambições apoiarem quase unanimemente a política de coesão europeia mostra a importância que atribuímos ao projecto de reequilíbrio do desenvolvimento em diferentes territórios.
Ao apoiarmos o compromisso alcançado entre o Parlamento e o Conselho, estamos a pôr fim a um processo de longos anos de negociação. Este é sem dúvida um passo na direcção certa, mas é um acordo minimalista que carece de ambição! Com efeito, os Estados-Membros terão apenas a possibilidade de, mas não serão de modo algum obrigados a, fazer com que os veículos pesados paguem os custos externos que geram. A verdade é que a ideia foi agora lançada, e é aí que reside o ponto verdadeiramente positivo que me permite votar a favor do compromisso.
Ao aprovar estas seis directivas e/ou regulamentos, e espero que as aprovemos, decerto levaremos a um avanço do euro, apenas um passo em frente, no sentido da disciplina de que tanto carecemos, e o valor deste pacote será demonstrado no futuro.
Ao aprovar este texto, o Parlamento Europeu demonstra a sua oposição a tendências regressivas e propõe que o orçamento da PAC no futuro permaneça, no mínimo, ao mesmo nível que o orçamento de 2013, garantindo assim que os agricultores recebam o apoio de que precisam para investir em novas tecnologias, já que é fundamental manter-se competitivo neste sector.
Ao aprovar o "Small Business Act” em 2008, a Comissão Europeia deu o primeiro passo decisivo na direcção das pequenas e médias empresas com a introdução do princípio "Think Small First” ["Pensar Primeiro em. Pequena Escala"] em todas as áreas da legislação. Apesar de todas as propostas aprovadas ao longo dos últimos três anos - e estou a lembrar-me em especial da Directiva "Atrasos de Pagamento" -, ainda temos de fazer grandes progressos para tornar mais fácil a actividade das pequenas e médias empresas tanto no que respeita aos encargos administrativos que têm de enfrentar, como na dificuldade no acesso ao financiamento. A Comissão Europeia tem de se manter na rota definida no SBA de 2008. É este o apelo lançado pela resolução à qual manifesto o meu apoio.
Ao aprovar o relatório Hökmark, o Parlamento está a optar pela inovação: a banda larga e o sector da telefonia móvel não têm um grande interesse apenas para os europeus, mas possibilita também o desenvolvimento de novas perspectivas em termos de investigação e desenvolvimento, domínios em que a União Europeia pode e deve aspirar a desempenhar um papel de liderança.
Ao aprovar o relatório do deputado Klinz que apela a uma regulamentação eficaz para as agências de notação, o Parlamento dá mais um passo no sentido do aumento da transparência dos mercados financeiros. É fundamental ultrapassar os problemas actuais que caracterizam o sector: a falta de concorrência, o excesso de confiança nas notações para fins regulamentares e a reduzida fiabilidade das notações.
Ao aprovar o relatório em apreço, o Parlamento lança uma luz sobre os resultados alcançados pelo programa em matéria de investigação nestes primeiros quatro anos.
Ao cabo de mais de duas semanas, a origem desta epidemia potencialmente mortal continua por identificar.
Ao considerar apenas a actividade económica, a criação de riqueza, e sendo útil, nessa medida, à determinação do crescimento económico, ele não contempla parâmetros tão importantes como a distribuição de riqueza, as desigualdades sociais, a qualidade de bens e serviços, as transacções não comerciais ou até as externalidades não contabilizadas pelo mercado - imprescindíveis à aferição do desenvolvimento e do progresso.
Ao considerarmos uma evolução no sentido de um maior enfoque nas zonas urbanas e nas cidades, da criação de um novo fundo para infra-estruturas e da possível criação de uma reserva de eficiência, teremos de fazer com que tudo isto não coloque em risco nem prejudique as regiões mais pobres da UE.
Ao contrário da Comissão, que considera que a armazenagem em camadas geológicas profundas é a opção mais segura para resíduos altamente radioactivos, penso que devíamos apoiar e intensificar a investigação de alternativas para a deposição de resíduos em locais profundos.
Ao contrário da comissão competente quanto à matéria de fundo, a Comissão do Controlo Orçamental tece críticas à Agência Europeia de Medicamentos no seu relatório e expressa inclusivamente o desejo de recusar a quitação a esta agência.
Ao contrário da direita europeia, que se exprimiu vigorosamente a favor da abertura de negociações sobre a conclusão de um acordo de comércio livre, eu defendia uma abordagem mais cautelosa. O Japão é uma potência comercial que requer prudência quando se trata da liberalização do comércio.
Ao contrário do Direito internacional, nos termos do qual a promoção e a protecção de uma minoria nacional é da responsabilidade do Estado em que vive essa minoria, esta constituição estipula igualmente que a Hungria é responsável pela sorte dos húngaros que vivem no estrangeiro. A nova Constituição húngara também apoia esforços tendentes a estabelecer o auto-governo colectivo, baseado na etnia das minorias húngaras que vivem no estrangeiro. É possível que as disposições da Constituição húngara sejam um processo de ingerência nos assuntos internos de Estados estrangeiros e de criar tensão entre a Hungria e países vizinhos, coisa que está em conflito com o espírito de uma Europa democrática.
Ao contrário do que acontecia na União Soviética de há 30 anos, temos na União Europeia instrumentos jurídicos muito bons para impor os nossos critérios de segurança, que se contam entre os mais elevados do mundo.
Ao contrário do último orador, considero que as negociações comerciais não são impulsionadas pelo interesse em retirar pessoas da situação de pobreza e melhorar o seu nível de vida, são sim impulsionadas pelas agendas dessas grandes empresas que pretendem obter mais acesso aos mercados e aumentar os lucros.
Ao contrário dos Estados Unidos, a Europa sofre directamente os efeitos dos acontecimentos na região, em virtude da sua proximidade geográfica.
Ao criar um quadro estratégico único poder-se-ão perder especificidades e a diversidade de áreas e sectores beneficiados, abrindo caminho à restrição do orçamento comunitário e à redução das verbas dos Fundos, como têm defendido as grandes potências da UE. Este novo enquadramento visa fomentar a concorrência e o reforço da integração das políticas da UE para concretizar a Estratégia Europa 2020, favorecendo os grandes grupos económicos e financeiros e a concentração e centralização do capital.
Ao debatermos os projectos europeus, um vice-presidente do mesmo Parlamento Europeu debate, de igual modo, questões todos os dias, de manhã à noite, mas sobre a segregação baseada em critérios étnicos, reduzindo a influência e enfraquecendo a autoridade de um Estado que se encontra no interior das suas fronteiras a favor de outro Estado vizinho, sobre a divisão de territórios que pertencem a um Estado-Membro da União Europeia e anexando-os a outro Estado-Membro da mesma União Europeia. Não só a título pessoal, como também em nome dos deputados romenos sociais-democratas no Parlamento Europeu, exijo que László Tőkés seja demitido do seu cargo de Vice-Presidente.
Ao designarmos a cidade Capital Europeia da Cultura em 2014 enviaríamos um importante sinal a favor do carácter multiétnico da cidade e do Estado da Bósnia-Herzegovina, o que também poderia motivar a classe política daquele país a repensar as suas ideias.
Ao determinar as perspectivas financeiras da UE para 2014-2020, é necessário assegurar um financiamento adequado para os domínios que estimulam o crescimento económico e o desenvolvimento bem-sucedido; por outras palavras, privilegiar a investigação e a promoção de inovações, o combate ao desemprego, à pobreza e à exclusão, a preparação adequada para as alterações demográficas, a utilização responsável dos recursos naturais, a segurança interna e externa, a política regional e agrícola e o desenvolvimento de infra-estruturas de energia e de transporte.
Ao discutir uma proposta legislativa, sabemos que nenhum país dispõe já da possibilidade de veto no Conselho.
Ao exigir uma atribuição de ajudas simplificada, reforçada e transparente, no âmbito da estratégia Europa 2020, este relatório procura estimular os programas de coesão europeus, a fim de corrigir ónus administrativos, sendo que estes constituem a razão pela qual a maior parte dos fundos atribuídos estão actualmente a ser retidos.
Ao fazê-lo, acabaremos por nos prejudicar também, e na verdade fá-lo-íamos na véspera da apresentação do projecto da nova Comissão sobre a revisão do nosso sistema de preferências comerciais.
Ao fazê-lo, estamos também a utilizar o espectro como veículo para colmatar o fosso digital e desenvolver serviços novos, ao alcance não só das grandes empresas de telecomunicações, mas também das pequenas e médias empresas (PME) e das start-ups, que bem precisarão deles.
Ao fechar o mercado europeu, podemos demonstrar a nossa intenção determinada de derrubar o regime de Lukashenko.
Ao fim e ao cabo a Europa já acolhe no seu território entre 15 e 20 milhões de muçulmanos. A Turquia é um dos membros fundadores do Conselho da Europa e da Organização para a Segurança e a Cooperação na Europa (OSCE), um membro da Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (OTAN) e da União da Europa Ocidental (UEO). Acaba de ser eleita membro não permanente do Conselho de Segurança. Por último, o facto de fazer parte do G20 contribui para demonstrar a importância deste país e o papel geoestratégico que poderá desempenhar na aliança das nações. É necessário que reconstruamos a confiança entre os nossos governos e demos corpo às esperanças expressas pela população e pelos jovens.
Ao ignorar fronteiras, os novos meios de comunicação e as novas tecnologias estão a abrir um mar de oportunidades.
Ao insistir em melhores salários, a UE está igualmente a garantir que, nesses países terceiros, existe mercado para as suas exportações. Se permitirmos que países que não garantem salários justos exportem para a Europa, estaremos, na verdade, a excluir as empresas europeias do mercado devido aos preços mais elevados que praticam. É mais difícil para as empresas da União competir com países terceiros que não cumprem as mesmas normas de segurança e que podem pagar aos trabalhadores salários muito mais baixos.
Ao introduzir o princípio do "poluidor-pagador" para os veículos pesados de mercadorias, a directiva prepara o caminho para o reconhecimento, nas nossas políticas públicas, da internalização dos custos externos gerados pelos transportes. O princípio da transparência das receitas e dos investimentos fica igualmente registado, o que, assim esperamos, será um precedente na avaliação das políticas públicas: com efeito, os Estados-Membros deverão apresentar regularmente à Comissão um relatório sobre a matéria.
Ao introduzir um direito europeu dos contratos e ao tornar a escolha da legislação nacional ou europeia facultativa para as empresas, confunde o sistema e irá gerar sobreposições jurídicas que podem resultar em tribunais onerosos. É igualmente provável que direito europeu dos contratos favoreça as políticas sociais e de emprego da UE, nomeadamente a directiva relativa ao tempo de trabalho, que se revelou muito impopular e causou perturbações no Reino Unido a várias empresas e serviços essenciais.
Ao introduzirmos uma política agrícola comum mais informada, seremos capazes de ser mais eficazes no combate às doenças da civilização associadas a estilos de vida pouco saudáveis e a dietas pobres.
Ao invés, propõe que se avance, passando de uma estratégia de tolerância zero para uma de risco tolerável quando se trata de fraudes no domínio da despesa da UE. Para piorar a situação, a Comissão e o Parlamento exigem aumentos do orçamento para os próximos anos. A maioria destes aumentos coincide com os domínios que apresentam o maior grau de irregularidades.
Ao largo da costa da Calábria, apenas a algumas milhas de distância do porto de Cetraro, existe um navio afundado que se sabia transportar resíduos altamente tóxicos.
Ao longo de muitos meses, os membros da Comissão do Mercado Interno e da Protecção dos Consumidores procuraram chegar a um acordo com o Conselho sobre os aspectos importantes do presente texto, a fim de proteger melhor os consumidores sem fazer com que as empresas sofressem devido a regras demasiado rígidas e desnecessárias, que restringiriam a actividade empresarial e aumentariam a burocracia.
Ao longo desse ano, desde Maio até hoje, criámos mecanismos de estabilidade eficazes que, inicialmente, tinham um carácter temporário e que, entretanto, irão assumir um carácter permanente a partir de 2013.
Ao longo destas negociações, procurei ter uma atitude construtiva, concedendo liberdade aos EstadosMembros da área do euro em particular para definirem as regras e as sanções que entenderem necessárias para assegurar a sua estabilidade. Não apoiei a posição dos colegas que consideram que a solução reside unicamente no reforço do papel do Parlamento Europeu.
Ao longo do procedimento de conciliação, alertei para que a recusa obstinada em fazer compromissos redundaria em fracasso como acabou por acontecer.
Ao longo do processo legislativo, sugerimos alterações sensatas e equilibradas às propostas da Comissão, propusemos uma ligação firme entre as reformas nacionais e os programas de estabilidade e crescimento utilizando as reformas como veículo sólido para a necessária promoção do investimento público.
Ao longo dos anos, foram celebrados vários acordos bilaterais para facilitar a existência de relações comerciais mais estreitas e, actualmente, a UE é o segundo maior parceiro comercial do Canadá e é a segunda maior fonte de investimento directo estrangeiro no Canadá. Concordo que a relação económica UE-Canadá ainda não alcançou o seu potencial máximo. O acordo de comércio livre previsto pode contribuir significativamente para desenvolver a parceria económica UE-Canadá e emitiria um forte sinal de crescimento aos investidores e às empresas da UE e do Canadá.
Ao longo dos últimos anos, demonstrámos bastas vezes que somos capazes de lançar iniciativas comunitárias quando elas são necessárias.
Ao melhorar as sinergias, poderemos aumentar o valor acrescentado europeu da política de coesão para os parceiros locais e regionais em toda a União Europeia, o que por sua vez permitirá aumentar os benefícios para os cidadãos.
Ao mesmo tempo que apoio o relatório anual do Conselho ao Parlamento Europeu sobre os principais aspectos e as opções fundamentais da Política Externa e de Segurança Comum (PESC), que é uma das políticas chave da União Europeia, desejo expressar o meu apoio à política que a União Europeia conduz neste momento a nível global. A nossa aprovação deste relatório anual reflecte a posição e o papel fortes da União Europeia no domínio das relações internacionais.
Ao mesmo tempo que se deve estimular o dinamismo das áreas urbanas através de sinergias efectivas e eficientes entre os diferentes instrumentos europeus de financiamento, nomeadamente no que diz respeito à investigação e à inovação.
Ao mesmo tempo, 15% das taxas cobradas devem ser investidas em redes transeuropeias de transportes: não apenas no transporte rodoviário, mas também o transporte ferroviário e na navegação nas vias navegáveis internas.
Ao mesmo tempo, afirma-se expressamente no relatório que a implementação do relatório Muscardini sobre a marcação de origem "fabricado em" - que, aliás, apoiámos fortemente - servirá para proteger a marcação de origem.
Ao mesmo tempo, apelamos às autoridades para que cumpram as regras de um Estado democrático e garantam o respeito pelos direitos humanos, obrigações que aceitaram enquanto parte da Parceria Oriental.
Ao mesmo tempo, as autoridades dedicaram particular atenção à luta contra a corrupção. A cooperação constante enquanto parte de um mecanismo especial estabelecido pela Comissão Europeia produziu resultados que demonstram que a Roménia reúne a capacidade institucional necessária e a vontade política para atingir os seus objectivos.
Ao mesmo tempo, as recomendações e opiniões expressas nesta avaliação intercalar são, evidentemente, da maior importância para a preparação de actividades futuras no domínio da investigação e da inovação. Isto envolverá o necessário salto quântico na simplificação, que será concretizável através de um quadro estratégico comum, novas regras de participação e - com a vossa ajuda - um Regulamento Financeiro revisto e de fácil utilização.
Ao mesmo tempo, com um conhecimento mútuo das línguas, as novas gerações desenvolveriam uma atitude muito mais positiva face ao outro, o que facilitaria a criação de relações entre as pessoas da mesma idade e seria decisivo para o futuro destas regiões. Por último, importa referir a importância de uma compreensão profunda do património cultural, para que as comunidades que partilham o mesmo espaço possam reconhecer e respeitar os valores culturais umas das outras.
Ao mesmo tempo, como estamos igualmente muito interessados em que a UE prossiga uma política orçamental responsável, saudamos os trechos em que se afirma que continuaremos também a identificar e a avaliar prioridades negativas.
Ao mesmo tempo, consideramos que cada euro que hoje é gasto com os juros da dívida significa um euro a menos para os hospitais, para os serviços públicos, para o ensino público e para a segurança social.
Ao mesmo tempo, corre-se naturalmente o risco de peculato, de apropriação indevida dos fundos.
Ao mesmo tempo, dado que a nossa função enquanto Parlamento é prestar contas aos cidadãos, temos de certificar-nos de que o dinheiro dos contribuintes é utilizado de maneira adequada, transparente e eficaz.
Ao mesmo tempo, desejamos repudiar as afirmações ou sugestões que insinuaram que o Conselho ou a Presidência húngara agiram desonestamente ou de má-fé, ou foram influenciados por grupos de interesses.
Ao mesmo tempo, estamos a promover tecnologias inovadoras (femtocélulas, tecnologias cognitivas), a fim de responder qualitativamente à procura de utilização de frequências.
Ao mesmo tempo, estamos abertos a discutir com os Estados-Membros - e, claro, com o Parlamento - várias opções referentes à possibilidade de criação de euro-obrigações, desde que os Estados-Membros estejam na disposição de considerar uma tal possibilidade, seguramente muito importante e decisiva.
Ao mesmo tempo, estes acordos constituem uma fonte preciosa de protecção jurídica para os investidores europeus que operam no estrangeiro.
Ao mesmo tempo, exorta a uma abordagem mais estratégica da cooperação cultural entre a UE e países terceiros. O relatório faz ainda sugestões interessantes com vista a que o Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa assuma o desafio de desenvolver uma verdadeira diplomacia cultural europeia.
Ao mesmo tempo, gostaria de salientar que a manutenção da diversidade das regiões da União Europeia no campo da inovação exige que seja dada uma atenção especial à formulação de um quadro estratégico financeiro comum para a investigação científica e a inovação.
Ao mesmo tempo, gostaria de sublinhar que a UE deve adoptar uma atitude de contenção e atribuir estes recursos por meio de uma redistribuição efectuada no âmbito do orçamento europeu existente.
Ao mesmo tempo, gostaríamos de sublinhar que a UE deve, tanto quanto possível, adoptar uma atitude de contenção e atribuir estes recursos por meio de uma redistribuição efectuada no âmbito do orçamento europeu existente.
Ao mesmo tempo, insto a Comissão Europeia a propor medidas pró-activas através do Fundo Europeu Agrícola de Desenvolvimento Rural (FEADER), a fim de apoiar o emprego das mulheres nas zonas rurais.
Ao mesmo tempo, muitas pequenas e médias empresas, as quais a UE está constantemente a elogiar (no papel) como sendo o motor da economia, receberam um golpe fatal, pois, escudados nos Acordos de Basileia, os bancos preferiram agarrar-se ao seu dinheiro em vez de os emprestarem às empresas em apuros. A crise do sector bancário veio também chamar a atenção para a queda do mito do "mercado que se auto-regula".
Ao mesmo tempo, não podemos deixar de obter um financiamento adequado para as políticas estratégicas da Europa e acções prioritárias, indispensáveis para um verdadeiro relançamento da União e para os 500 milhões de cidadãos europeus.
Ao mesmo tempo, não podemos protegê-las como bebés de colo. Às vezes, é como um campo de minas; somos atingidos e vamos desenvolvendo a nossa atenção. No entanto, os riscos devem ser razoavelmente previsíveis e nós temos que ser capazes de compreender os riscos que corremos.
Ao mesmo tempo, o parecer da comissão realça o facto de a presente redução da produção de emissões na Europa não poder ser interpretada como um sinal de que a UE esteja a caminho de atingir o objectivo fixado.
Ao mesmo tempo, o relatório declara que as famílias e as minorias migrantes, como os ciganos, utilizam em muito menor medida os serviços de educação na primeira infância disponibilizados do que outras famílias. Não podemos permitir que o nível das nossas escolas continue a cair porque muitas crianças simplesmente não compreendem o que lhes é ensinado.
Ao mesmo tempo, os Estados-Membros manifestaram a firme vontade - chegando a assumir o compromisso de o fazer sempre que possível - de reinvestir as receitas geradas no sistema de transportes, a fim de o tornar mais sustentável e de reinvestir pelo menos 15% das receitas na rede transeuropeia de transportes.
Ao mesmo tempo, os países da União Europeia também deverão estar cientes de que é do seu interesse a adesão da Roménia e da Bulgária ao espaço Schengen, porque estes dois países poderão dar o seu contributo para a segurança de todos os Estados-Membros e para o alargamento do espaço Schengen, instituído para fortalecer o processo de integração na União Europeia e o espaço comum de liberdade, segurança e justiça.
Ao mesmo tempo, os princípios estabelecidos para uma PAC competitiva/viável/justa, conjuntamente com a dissociação dos pagamentos directos da produção, irão beneficiar os grandes proprietários de terras. A anterior revisão da PAC preparou o terreno, e nos últimos dois anos provocou uma redução drástica do rendimento real per capita dos agricultores e uma diminuição do emprego no sector agrícola. O relatório trata os géneros alimentícios como uma mercadoria, como produção agrícola para fins exclusivamente lucrativos, que é aquilo que está na origem dos escândalos alimentares criminosos e diários dos monopólios agro-alimentares. O relatório não formula qualquer restrição sobre os OGM, que envolvem enormes riscos para a saúde pública e para o ecossistema. A única saída consiste em proporcionar aos trabalhadores e às classes mais pobres a possibilidade de desfrutarem da riqueza que produzem.
Ao mesmo tempo, penso que deveríamos instar os Estados-Membros a implementarem a iniciativa JESSICA a nível das cidades e não a nível de regiões ou Estados. Só assim as cidades possuirão realmente o instrumento JESSICA, permitindo-lhe que tenha efeito a longo prazo.
Ao mesmo tempo, qualquer Estado-Membro tem o direito de isentar os veículos com menos de 12 toneladas, opção que, espero, a Estónia venha a utilizar.
Ao mesmo tempo, queremos saber que a unidade do orçamento está protegida e que a política orçamental não está a ser retirada do orçamento da União. Quando discutimos a despesa, temos de fazer referência às obrigações que resultam do Tratado de Lisboa.
Ao mesmo tempo, quero enaltecer a proposta de manutenção de um elevado nível de financiamento para a política de coesão. A política de coesão não se limita a desempenhar um papel fundamental no cumprimento dos objectivos da Estratégia "Europa 2020”; a sua principal missão é reforçar a integração e a solidariedade europeias reduzindo as diferenças sociais, económicas e territoriais que, infelizmente, ainda existem na União Europeia.
Ao mesmo tempo, temos de perceber que não é possível conseguir mais Europa com menos fundos. O congelamento dos recursos pelos Estados-Membros não será uma opção sustentável.
Ao mesmo tempo, vamos trabalhar sobre as medidas preventivas que nos devem ajudar a evitar tais processos.
Ao mesmo tempo, é absolutamente necessário termos em conta o enorme potencial das novas tecnologias, que constituem uma fonte de informação e um canal que facilita a liberdade de expressão. Penso que seria útil o Parlamento Europeu incluir a cultura na agenda dos debates com outros parlamentos de todo o mundo, a fim de dar o seu contributo para a instituição de uma prática generalizada da acção externa europeia.
Ao mesmo tempo, é necessário procurar tornar as empresas agrícolas competitivas.
Ao não reconhecer o que está a acontecer, o regime perde a sua legitimidade e afasta-se dos cidadãos e da comunidade internacional. A opressão violenta e as ameaças dentro e fora do país são instrumentos que pertencem a uma era há muito desaparecida. A preocupação deste Parlamento e da União Europeia são as pessoas de Deraa, onde foi negado o acesso às Nações Unidas, de Baniyas, onde prossegue a repressão, em Hama, onde os tanques avançaram. O povo sírio não cede a tanques.
Ao nível das políticas, foram definidos objectivos específicos e roteiros em recentes documentos de política.
Ao oferecer os benefícios do comércio livre, a UE deve insistir para que os problemas sejam resolvidos e deve supervisionar o processo. É importante que a Comissão inclua no acordo de comércio livre cláusulas juridicamente vinculativas em matéria de direitos humanos, normas sociais e ambientais e a responsabilidade social das empresas, e se certifique, além disso, de que essas exigências são respeitadas.
Ao pedir para participar nos trabalhos do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência (OEDT), a República da Croácia mostrou que partilha o interesse da UE e dos seus Estados-Membros pelos objectivos e pela actividade do Centro, cuja tarefa consiste em recolher dados sobre a droga e a toxicodependência, para elaborar e publicar informações objectivas, fiáveis e comparáveis a nível europeu. É por isso que aprovei o relatório da nossa colega Debora Serracchiani sobre a celebração do Acordo entre a União Europeia e a República da Croácia sobre a participação da República da Croácia nos trabalhos do OEDT.
Ao preconizarmos normas mínimas comuns para todos os Estados-Membros, estamos a incentivar os seus governos a investirem em novas tecnologias, com vista à obtenção de resultados rápidos concretos no que respeita à eliminação destes resíduos extremamente perigosos.
Ao promovermos o uso integrado do mercado único, explorando as vantagens que oferece, podemos reforçar o crescimento e a prosperidade a nível europeu e dar um novo impulso ao empreendedorismo.
Ao propor, basicamente, o congelamento do orçamento comunitário até 2020 (com uma actualização residual de 5 %), comprometem-se assim muitos dos objectivos enunciados ao longo das suas 40 páginas - e, muito especialmente, o objectivo da coesão económica e social.
Ao que parece alguns Estados - incluindo a supramencionada Índia, inimiga número um do Paquistão - estão dispostos a dar o seu consentimento, não gratuitamente, é claro, mas em troca da concessão de condições favoráveis semelhantes por parte da União Europeia, que está inclinada a acolher tais pedidos.
Ao que parece, nesses países a prática era emitir um mandado de detenção europeu sempre que se emitia um mandado de detenção nacional.
Ao reestruturar a nossa política agrícola, podemos garantir que se centra no bem-estar animal, que os animais são mantidos em condições adequadas à sua espécie, e que são fortes e robustos, seguindo o princípio de que a prevenção é melhor do que a cura.
Ao regular as relações contratuais entre empresas, e entre as empresas e os consumidores, a adopção de um instrumento facultativo e de uma "caixa de ferramentas” pode garantir uma maior protecção dos consumidores na Europa.
Ao relatar o nível de exposição à dívida soberana, os intervenientes no Mercado poderão fazer a sua própria avaliação do risco.
Ao serem alteradas, torna-se difícil compreender que disposição está actualmente em vigor. A codificação é igualmente um meio adequado para desenvolver o direito da União Europeia de uma forma mais simples, mais clara e mais compreensível para os cidadãos.
Ao solicitar um aumento do auxílio de minimis de 30 000 euros para 60 000 euros para os próximos três anos, queremos enviar um sinal forte ao sector, o qual, nos últimos anos, devido sobretudo à entrada em vigor da política comum das pescas e de novas medidas restritivas, tem registado uma redução em certos modos de pesca de pequena e média escala, e por vezes até a sua eliminação total.
Ao todo, foram testados 91 dos principais bancos europeus e falharam 7. Em relação a isso, tenho uma crítica importante a fazer. Não foram contabilizadas as consequências que a falência de um país poderá provocar, o que continua a ser uma possibilidade nos casos da Grécia, da Irlanda e de Portugal.
Ao transformar as três directivas existentes numa única resolução, a proposta facilita o processo de adaptação da legislação ao progresso técnico, permitindo ao mesmo tempo que os utilizadores de fibras beneficiem mais facilmente dos produtos inovadores existentes no mercado.
Ao votar a favor do relatório Garriga Polledo, o Parlamento Europeu fez ouvir a sua voz sobre o futuro do orçamento europeu e avançou uma proposta ambiciosa para o próximo quadro financeiro plurianual. O pedido de aumentar o orçamento da UE pós-2013 em 5 % e, por conseguinte, de aumentar o RNB total da União Europeia de 1,06 % para 1,11 %, corresponde ao desejo de honrar os compromissos assumidos em matéria de apoio ao crescimento e ao desenvolvimento, em primeiro lugar e acima de tudo a estratégia Europa 2020, para a qual são necessários recursos adequados.
Ao votar contra o relatório, o Partido Comunista Grego votou contra a PAC no seu todo, tanto a "nova" como a actual, que arruinou as pequenas e médias explorações agrícolas e promove o desenvolvimento agrícola com base no critério da rentabilidade das empresas alimentares monopolistas. O relatório inclui a "nova" PAC na antipopular Estratégia Europa 2020, com o objectivo de levar à ruína as pequenas e médias explorações e de concentrar a terra, a produção, os subsídios e o comércio unicamente nas mãos das empresas agrícolas capitalistas. É por isso que apela à concessão de apoio directo aos agricultores activos, excluindo assim os agricultores pobres forçados a trabalhar fora da agricultura.
Ao votar favoravelmente o programa "Juventude em Movimento” - um quadro destinado a melhorar os sistemas de ensino e formação europeus - pretendi apoiar um plano de acção ambicioso a favor dos jovens europeus. O Tratado de Lisboa ampliou as competências da UE no domínio da juventude.
Aos membros desta Assembleia pertencentes ao Grupo do Partido Popular Europeu (Democratas-Cristãos) - que seguem sempre a Comissão ou o Conselho - eu diria que não estamos aqui para deixar passar tudo tranquilamente, mas para pensarmos por nós próprios. É isso que os eleitores esperam de nós. Tenho de vos recordar, pois, que, neste momento, os senhores não sabem dizer se um Estado-Membro está a comprar armamento de defesa e caças ou a investir no sistema de ensino do futuro.
Aos meus caros colegas, eu recomendaria dois documentos que vale a pena ler antes de transformarem os seus pensamentos em críticas violentas: o Tratado de Lisboa e o próprio relatório. O apoio aos recursos próprios é, nem mais nem menos, o que está consagrado no Tratado de Lisboa.
Aos que tenham boas propostas a apresentar nesta matéria só posso dizer o seguinte: crêem verdadeiramente, dada a diversidade de sensibilidades e de opiniões, de partidários e de opositores da energia nuclear, que é provável alcançar unanimidade quanto a uma actualização do Tratado Euratom? Não creio que seja muito provável. É por essa razão que sou a favor de uma abordagem realista e de que façamos o melhor que pudermos do Tratado que temos.
Aparentemente inclui, em diversas passagens, uma série de pormenores que não são consensuais para diferentes pessoas, contudo, trata-se de um passo em frente muito considerável.
Aparentemente, este texto permite ainda que o direito ao aborto na Hungria seja limitado pela afirmação, e passo a citar: "de que a vida do feto será protegida desde o momento da concepção”. O Governo húngaro apoiou as suas palavras com medidas neste domínio através do lançamento de uma campanha de comunicação antiaborto que, aparentemente, ainda utiliza fundos do programa comunitário PROGRESS (Programa Comunitário para o Emprego e a Solidariedade Social).
Aparentemente, existem centenas de grupos de peritos a trabalhar sobre os textos oficiais publicados pela Comissão, mas a identidade dos membros dessas entidades consultivas, que se reúnem à porta fechada, continua muito bem guardada.
Aparentemente, tratava-se de um navio maltês. Por conseguinte, gostaria de saber: de que navio se tratava e que informações estão disponíveis? Quem se absteve de resgatar esses 600 refugiados líbios? No século XXI, ninguém irá por certo dizer-me que não foi possível identificar o navio em questão. A falta de acção constitui um crime: o de não prestar auxílio a pessoas em perigo.
Apela à revisão da política agrícola comum para 2014-2020, com o objectivo de enfrentar os desafios da sustentabilidade ambiental, criação de emprego e garantia de alimentos seguros e de alta qualidade.
Apelamos a um reconhecimento à escala da UE de qualificações do ensino secundário, profissional e universitário.
Apelamos ainda à Comissão para que apoie a reforma do sistema judicial na Ucrânia, utilizando programas de reforço de capacidades e ponderando a criação de um grupo consultivo da UE de alto nível para a Ucrânia que ajude o país nos seus esforços de harmonização com a legislação da UE, incluindo o sistema judicial.
Apelamos à atribuição de mais recursos para a melhoria das infra-estruturas nas nossas regiões fronteiriças e queremos reforçar também as redes transeuropeias.
Apelo a que a Comissão, em conjunto com o Parlamento Europeu, empregue um método mais comunitário no pacote da governação económica.
Apelo ao Parlamento Europeu e à Organização Mundial de Saúde que tomem uma posição nesta matéria para impedir um Estado-Membro da União Europeia de se transformar num campo de extermínio.
Apelo para a Comissão para que elabore critérios juridicamente vinculativos para o desenvolvimento sustentável de biomassa lenhosa, ao mesmo tempo que introduz instrumentos destinados a reunir informação sobre as florestas e a silvicultura, e para que torne essa informação disponível.
Apelo publicamente à Alta Representante da União. Já lhe solicitei por escrito que envide todos os esforços para intervir em nome desses profissionais do sector da saúde que actuaram como verdadeiros profissionais da saúde - tentando salvar vidas.
Apelo também à Comissão que simplifique o conceito de política de coesão, centrando-a nos resultados, e não em procedimentos complicados de controlo. A nova política deve caracterizar-se por uma maior flexibilidade, proporcionalidade e visibilidade na utilização dos fundos.
Apelo à Comissão para que veja nisto um argumento para apresentar uma nova proposta.
Apelo à tomada de medidas para o estabelecimento rápido da cooperação euro-japonesa na aeronáutica, quer ao nível das empresas, quer ao nível de unidades de investigação e desenvolvimento.
Apelo, assim, à Comissão para que, tendo em conta o objectivo de financiamento da investigação e do desenvolvimento tecnológico para 2020 de 3% do PIB, pondere a possibilidade de estabelecer para a UE um sistema de governo efectivo deste objectivo, à luz do que acontece com o governo económico.
Apelo, por conseguinte, a todos sem excepção para começarem de novo com um novo espírito e uma nova perspectiva, porque espero e rezo para que as expectativas e a vontade do povo sejam respeitadas da próxima vez.
Apelo, por isso, à Comissão para que defina as situações em que é lícito falar-se de "afluxo maciço de pessoas deslocadas” nos termos da Directiva 2001/55/CE relativa à protecção temporária, mediante a apresentação de critérios exactos e quantificáveis para que a situação possa ser considerada permanente.
Apelo, por isso, à Comissão para que não só aperfeiçoe os mecanismos de monitoragem, como também adopte as medidas necessárias para que a recolha de dados seja mais abrangente, assim como para que enquadre no pacote legislativo da PAC, que está em preparação, o conjunto de estímulos que impulsionem as boas práticas neste domínio.
Apenas 10 Estados-Membros forneceram informações, o que é muito pouco.
Apenas a resolução apresentada pelo meu grupo e as do Grupo dos Verdes/Aliança Livre Europeia e do Grupo Confederal da Esquerda Unitária Europeia - Esquerda Nórdica Verde ofereciam uma visão progressista das relações comerciais da UE com a Índia. Não é de admirar que não tenha conseguido resistir à maioria de direita no Parlamento, o que é uma pena.
Apenas alguns partidários de uma Europa federal desejariam escutá-la a uma só voz, mas é a diversidade e a cooperação diplomática que constituem a verdadeira riqueza da Europa, seja nas Nações Unidas ou noutro contexto.
Apenas as importações de têxteis e vestuário da Bielorrússia e da Coreia do Norte - nenhum dos quais é membro da OMC - se encontram ainda sujeitas a restrições quantitativas. O sistema de autorizações de importação continua a existir para efeitos de controlo das importações desses dois países, as quais, no entanto, não colocam quaisquer problemas, em termos do funcionamento do mercado comunitário.
Apenas através da aprovação de acordos ambiciosos que respeitem os princípios defendidos pela UE poderemos dar um contributo válido para as actividades e os progressos desta última.
Apenas com uma visão integrada, concentrada nos resultados e em consonância com os objectivos de um crescimento inteligente, sustentável e inclusivo, será possível falar de uma eficácia reforçada entre os vários fundos estruturais.
Apenas o regime de Kaddafi condena neste momento "a conspiração internacional que ataca a segurança nacional da Síria", uma declaração que diz muito sobre a situação na Síria.
Apenas trouxe problemas. A supressão das fronteiras internas não assegura liberdade de circulação para os cidadãos europeus; em vez disso, cria insegurança e produz tendências demográficas e migratórias impossíveis de gerir na UE, nos países de origem e nos países de destino.
Apenas uma sinergia eficaz entre eles possibilitará a redução efectiva do desemprego.
Apertados entre os seus grandes vizinhos, a Rússia e a China, a Mongólia corre o risco de se tornar ainda mais dependente desses Estados do que era anteriormente.
Apesar da atenção compreensível dedicada aos problemas do Sul, não podemos esquecer como são importantes os nossos vizinhos do Leste. A Turquia desempenha também um papel importante neste contexto. Não devemos ver apenas a Turquia como um candidato à adesão. A Turquia também tem de ser uma parceira nossa, em particular, no que respeita à situação no Mediterrâneo.
Apesar da crise económica em que vivemos, é importante a manutenção destes instrumentos de apoio aos países em desenvolvimento para que estes consigam, num futuro próximo, aumentar os seus níveis de riqueza, com a inerente melhoria das condições de vida das populações nos chamados países emergentes.
Apesar da formação contínua de agentes de polícia e da disponibilização do equipamento necessário, os resultados em termos de investigação e repressão dos crimes relacionados com droga têm de ser consideravelmente melhorados. A Croácia continua a ser uma das principais rotas de tráfico de droga para a UE. Somos certamente favoráveis à aprovação pelo governo de um programa nacional de prevenção do consumo de drogas entre os jovens, que visa actualizar os programas existentes.
Apesar da guerra que está a decorrer e do seu alargamento a várias partes da Líbia, as organizações humanitárias estão a fazer um trabalho notável na prevenção de uma grande catástrofe humanitária.
Apesar das dificuldades encontradas nas negociações, devido sobretudo um contexto internacional altamente delicado, o trabalho sobre a proposta de directiva do Conselho relativa à gestão do combustível irradiado e dos resíduos radioactivos permitiu delinear um quadro legislativo harmonizado e coerente, a fim de garantir que este tipo de resíduos seja gerido de forma segura, independentemente das aplicações e das consequências que a energia nuclear possa ter de futuro.
Apesar das melhorias verificadas neste domínio, as avaliações de impacto da Comissão Europeia e do Parlamento Europeu podem melhorar ainda mais. O presente relatório, que mereceu o meu apoio, apela a uma maior integração das comissões do Parlamento Europeu, à justificação circunstanciada quando a Comissão Europeia prescinda da avaliação de impacto, e finalmente lança o desafio às comissões parlamentares para intensificarem a utilização das avaliações de impacto de forma a melhorar a qualidade da sua acção legislativa.
Apesar de a Carta dos Direitos Fundamentais só ser vinculativa para a legislação comunitária e sua execução, os artigos 2.º, 6.º e 7.º dos Tratados são vinculativos para todos os Estados-Membros.
Apesar de a UE ter aberto o seu mercado de contratos públicos a países terceiros, o acesso das empresas europeias ao mercado de adjudicações de contratos públicos de países terceiros continua a ser muito limitado.
Apesar de a decisão que institui uma acção comunitária de apoio à Capital Europeia da Cultura 2007-2019 abarcar apenas, neste momento, os Estados-Membros da UE, a verdade é que, já em várias ocasiões, foi dada a oportunidade a cidades de países terceiros de conquistarem o título de Capital Europeia da Cultura.
Apesar de a maioria dos delitos serem graves, violentos, sexuais ou desonestos, a lista inclui igualmente os delitos ambíguos dos crimes de pensamento, apreciados em muitos países continentais, para que a pessoa possa ser transferida para julgamento, ou melhor, para condenação automática, para um desses locais degradantes.
Apesar de a maioria dos trabalhadores domésticos serem trabalhadores precários, que são frequentemente discriminados e explorados, a Comissão do Emprego e dos Assuntos Sociais decidiu fazer adoptar uma resolução, questionando simultaneamente a Comissão Europeia sobre as medidas que terão sido tomadas em relação a esta categoria de trabalhadores.
Apesar de apenas 7% da população da UE viver em cidades com mais de 5 milhões de habitantes, contra 25% nos EUA, em muitas áreas urbanas, inclusivamente na Grécia, a população está a aumentar.
Apesar de as pessoas poderem criticar a nova metodologia bem como diversos parâmetros, o objectivo comum deve ficar claro. A transparência é essencial para determinar a susceptibilidade dos bancos europeus à crise. É urgente que exista uma ampla confiança, cabendo um papel aos bancos relativamente a essa questão e que é do seu próprio interesse.
Apesar de atravessarmos num contexto orçamental difícil, os pescadores nunca conseguiriam entender que a União não fosse capaz de dar resposta às suas apreensões. Além disso, a resolução apela a que seja dada especial atenção à pesca costeira de pequena escala e às regiões afectadas. A meu ver, isto é indispensável, dado que, apesar de o conjunto do sector estar a ser afectado, o aumento da factura energética vai ter um impacto maior sobre a pesca tradicional do que sobre a pesca industrial.
Apesar de essas substâncias serem receitadas para utilização em animais, afectam quer os seres humanos quer os animais. O principal objectivo da presente proposta de resolução é fazer com que os antimicrobianos se mantenham como ferramenta eficaz no combate às doenças, tanto nas pessoas como nos animais, limitando a sua utilização aos casos estritamente necessários.
Apesar de esta actividade ser encarada de uma forma bastante negativa em França, não é, na verdade, inteiramente ilegítimo que os grupos de interesses, sejam de natureza comercial ou social, sejam sindicatos, etc. dêem a conhecer os seus pontos de vista e os seus conhecimentos específicos, em especial aos funcionários públicos e representantes eleitos com menos conhecimentos.
Apesar de já possuirmos um conjunto significativo de organismos oficiais, está obviamente a pensar numa forma de reforçar o controlo das autoridades dos Estados-Membros nesta área.
Apesar de não considerar que a Comissão Europeia devesse ter mais poderes do que tinha anteriormente, concordo que a União Monetária europeia deve estabelecer um mecanismo de controlo mútuo mais exacto para a política orçamental.
Apesar de o Japão ter sofrido um dos maiores terramotos alguma vez registados, seguido de um dos maiores tsunamis já ocorridos - mesmo não estando preparados para estes acontecimentos, mesmo não tendo realizado as melhorias propostas, mesmo não tendo feito nada para garantir o fornecimento de energia em caso de emergência, e mesmo tendo os japoneses cometido outros erros no início - houve poucos danos pessoais.
Apesar de o relatório representar um passo na direcção certa, ainda há muito para fazer.
Apesar de preservar a estrutura original do Objectivo 3, o relatório propõe um aumento dos fundos e chama a atenção para as necessidades específicas das populações de fronteira. É possível garantir uma abordagem estratégica e uma resposta orientada para as necessidades e as especificidades de cada região através de uma afectação de fundos aos programas de cooperação territorial, decidida com base em critérios harmonizados.
Apesar de questionarem alguns dos seus elementos, já foi referido que uma Constituição pode sempre ser alterada por referendo e, se considerarmos a nível europeu que alguns aspectos do texto não respeitam a legislação e os valores comunitários, pode ser esse o procedimento.
Apesar de referir que o espectro radioeléctrico representa um recurso público crucial para vários sectores e serviços essenciais, coloca-o no caminho da viabilização do comércio de direitos espectrais e convida a Comissão a adoptar medidas para assegurar que os Estados-Membros autorizam, dentro da União Europeia, o comércio de direitos de utilização do espectro.
Apesar de ter frisado que a nossa posição face ao Hamas permanece inalterada, deixei bem claro que apoiamos todos os meios, mediante os quais o Presidente Abbas possa promover a unidade entre os Palestinianos, através do seu governo tecnocrático e da realização de eleições - algo que se irá revelar da maior importância. Não alterámos a nossa posição e temos a certeza de que estamos a ser cautelosos na análise que fazemos da situação.
Apesar de ter melhorado a percepção de alguns Estados-Membros, todas estas medidas não conseguiram restabelecer a confiança no seio da União Europeia.
Apesar de ter poucas dúvidas quanto ao alcance excessivo do texto - que se enquadra na Estratégia Europa 2020 - saúdo os objectivos da resolução. Por conseguinte, votei a favor do relatório Coelho sobre a verificação das condições necessárias à aplicação do acervo de Schengen, que constitui uma condição prévia para a abolição dos controlos internos nas fronteiras com a Bulgária e a Roménia.
Apesar de tudo isso, votaremos a favor deste princípio porque se trata de um avanço importante. É um princípio como outros - falou-se anteriormente sobre o princípio da precaução, que deixou a sua marca nas directivas europeias.
Apesar de tudo o que aconteceu, Sarajevo é uma cidade que manteve o seu espírito multicultural e a sua força. Para reconhecer este facto, designar Sarajevo Capital Europeia da Cultura 2014 seria um forte gesto simbólico para reafirmar a mensagem de paz e de estabilidade da Europa. É uma pena deixar passar este momento histórico invocando as regras. Só quando fazemos as pazes com o passado, quando admitimos e enfrentamos a história, podemos olhar abertamente para o futuro, pelo que peço que concedam esta oportunidade a Sarajevo.
Apesar de tudo, a Comissão apresentou a proposta ao Parlamento, e a Comissão INTA, a que presido e a este relatório de que sou relator acidental, resolveu avançar com a discussão e a votação do relatório. É o resultado dessa votação que aqui trazemos ao plenário.
Apesar de, em muitos aspectos, ter perdido força durante o processo, e de o Parlamento ter tido de fazer cedências em diversas disposições, o presente relatório não deixa de representar um grande passo em frente, pelo que considero dever dar-lhe o meu total apoio.
Apesar deste número, considero fundamental que os princípios da economia, os princípios da eficiência e os princípios da eficácia sejam aplicados. E, para além disso, na execução orçamental deve promover-se a poupança e deve incentivar-se essa poupança e, em simultâneo, não podemos incentivar e promover de forma nenhuma a utilização da totalidade das verbas de cada rubrica.
Apesar destes conflitos entre a lógica e a versão da recomendação debatida neste hemiciclo o Grupo Confederal da Esquerda Unitária Europeia - Esquerda Nórdica Verde apoia a posição do relator.
Apesar disso, acho que é importante que a União Europeia procure aplicar as regras e os acordos da Organização Internacional do Trabalho em tratados internacionais com países terceiros, pois à medida que ficamos a saber mais sobre o mercado e as condições de trabalho na Ásia, África e outros cantos do mundo, torna-se aparente que devemos lutar para garantir melhorias significativas no estatuto dos trabalhadores também nestas regiões e áreas.
Apesar disso, considero a cláusula retrógrada e desnecessariamente submissa à pressão populista dos líderes francês e italiano. Não estamos a falar de algo insignificante, mas de um princípio fundamental: liberdade de circulação. Não estou convencida de que devamos sacrificá-lo aos actuais problemas com o controlo das pressões migratórias provenientes de África.
Apesar disso, no entanto, convencemos todos os Estados-Membros a tomar parte nessa avaliação. Todos eles, num total de 14, optaram voluntariamente por participar nos testes, o que representa um grande êxito para o Parlamento Europeu.
Apesar disso, não votei a favor do relatório, uma vez que quero manifestar o meu desacordo fundamental relativamente à adopção da proposta relativa a um limite máximo de pagamentos baseado na dimensão da exploração. Tal vai discriminar agricultores checos, por exemplo, ou vai obrigá-los a dividir artificialmente as explorações em unidades mais pequenas, a fim de obter um subsídio.
Apesar do decreto emitido pelo Presidente, em Março deste ano, no qual autorizava oficialmente um prolongamento da detenção em Guantánamo de alguns prisioneiros, a União faz votos - ou antes, espera - que o Governo dos Estados Unidos continue a discutir este assunto no Congresso e a trabalhar no sentido do encerramento do campo de detenção, o mais brevemente possível.
Apesar do facto de a UE ter aberto os seus mercados a países de fora da União, as nossas empresas enfrentam enormes dificuldades no acesso aos mercados do sector público de países terceiros.
Apesar do facto de o trabalho na simplificação de processos ter abrandando durante os mais de dois anos gastos neste dossier, gostaria de observar que o Parlamento propôs o alargamento do âmbito original de aplicação do regulamento, em particular, para incluir disposições relativas ao país de origem de produtos têxteis, de modo que fiquei satisfeito por ter sido encontrado um compromisso equilibrado.
Apesar do impacto dramático da crise económica no mercado de trabalho europeu, a evolução industrial e tecnológica faz aumentar a procura de mão-de-obra com qualificações elevadas e médias.
Apesar do êxito desta votação, considerando as implicações transfronteiriças para a segurança e a saúde dos cidadãos europeus, lamento que tenha sido atribuído um papel tão insignificante ao Parlamento no que respeita aos assuntos nucleares, já que se trata de um papel meramente consultivo.
Apesar dos custos elevados, a disponibilização de redes de fibra óptica deveria, na minha opinião, ser incentivada. A União Europeia está, neste momento, a deixar-se atrasar em relação aos seus concorrentes, os Estados Unidos e a China, o que é provavelmente consequência de uma política hesitante e de demasiada burocracia.
Aplaudimos as medidas que alguns Estados-Membros tomaram, como a divisão de concursos em lotes e a melhoria do acesso electrónico a informações a partir de sítios Web centralizados e de páginas Web interactivas, mas pensamos que isto não é suficiente.
Aplaudimos, portanto, a forma como os diferentes intervenientes estão a desempenhar as suas funções e, a este propósito, é pertinente mencionar alguns dos maiores desafios imediatos que este Estado recém-criado irá encontrar.
Aplaudo a previsão da possibilidade de um Estado-Membro poder afastar-se temporariamente da trajectória de ajustamento por força e acontecimentos imprevistos, o que garante flexibilidade e realismo ao processo.
Aplaudo a vontade política de apoiar o financiamento já afectado à investigação sobre o cancro ao abrigo do programa.
Aplaudo o convite à Comissão Europeia para que elabore uma proposta legislativa com vista à adopção de novos sistemas de etiquetagem mais exactos e completos.
Aplaudo, por isso, o facto de o relatório apelar à criação de uma infra-estrutura que possibilite avaliar os impactos das propostas e planos elaborados no Parlamento.
Aplica-se também a outro ponto que eu tenho em mente; embora não o tenham mencionado, essa é uma das razões, ou uma das causas, da crise: as remunerações e os prémios obscenos, que eram ainda mais elevados quando os riscos assumidos eram maiores, pois aqueles que assumiam os riscos sabiam que estes seriam pagos por outros.
Aplicação do acervo de Schengen na Bulgária e na Roménia (
Aplicámos sanções à Bielorrússia, mas não fizemos o mesmos relativamente ao caso Magnitski na Rússia, embora este tivesse sido mencionado pelo Parlamento Europeu no Relatório Anual sobre Direitos Humanos no Mundo de 2009 e na política da União Europeia sobre esta matéria.
Apoia a União Europeia - importante interlocutor do G8 - esta afirmação? Em caso afirmativo, foi isso comunicado à parte palestiniana, que está a planear tomar uma iniciativa unilateral no decorrer da Assembleia-Geral das Nações Unidas, em Setembro?
Apoia as medidas para derrubar a série de barreiras enfrentadas por aqueles que desejam proceder a transacções transfronteiriças no mercado interno e considera que o projecto de Direito europeu dos contratos, juntamente com outras medidas, é útil para a plena realização do mercado interno
Apoiamos a iniciativa de reduzir os resíduos ao mínimo e de, caso os resultados da investigação e desenvolvimento o permitam, incrementar a reciclagem, pois o princípio da reversibilidade é para nós de extrema importância.
Apoiamos em especial a proposta da Comissão Europeia com vista a um aumento de 4,9% para as dotações de pagamento.
Apoiamos esta alteração do Regimento do Parlamento Europeu, que prevê que, se uma questão se revestir de importância significativa, a conferência dos presidentes poderá decidir que seja aplicado um processo de reuniões conjuntas das comissões parlamentares e de votação conjunta.
Apoiamos o procedimento de quitação com base nas conclusões do Tribunal de Contas porque essa é a regra, é isso que vem no Tratado; além disso, esperamos que o Parlamento e nós próprios tenhamos em conta que a simplificação dos regulamentos existentes e o reforço da sua transparência são tarefas complexas.
Apoiamos plenamente as recomendações das Nações Unidas.
Apoiando-se sobre os sistemas existentes, criados e lançados pelo PE em 1996, e pela Comissão Europeia em 2008, procura dar resposta a alguns problemas recentes, embora se argumente, no relatório, com os novos poderes do Parlamento Europeu após a entrada em vigor do Tratado de Lisboa.
Apoiei a nomeação de Hans Gustaf Wessberg como membro do Tribunal de Contas, porque possui mais de 30 anos de experiência profissional em cargos de gestão de alto nível em instituições públicas, bem como em empresas privadas, na Suécia.
Apoiei activamente esta resolução, que apela à Comissão para que adopte fortes medidas de apoio à indústria das pescas. O aumento dos preços do petróleo está a provocar uma verdadeira crise neste sector. A crise começou por ser cíclica, mas tornou-se estrutural e ameaça a viabilidade económica daquela indústria.
Apoiei esta resolução. O projecto Capital Europeia da Cultura contribui para o apoio da riqueza e da diversidade das culturas europeias e das características que partilham, e para a promoção de um maior entendimento mútuo entre os cidadãos europeus.
Apoiei este documento porque propõe o estabelecimento de normas relativas à presença de partes não têxteis de origem animal em certos produtos, bem como a indicação da origem dos produtos de forma precisa.
Apoiei este documento porque, em 2009, a UE e o Japão representavam, no seu conjunto, mais de um quarto do PIB mundial e mais de 20% do comércio mundial e, além disso, o Japão e a UE são investidores significativos economias um do outro. O Conselho e a Comissão observaram que a capacidade do Japão para remover as barreiras regulamentares ao comércio é uma condição prévia para o início das negociações sobre o Acordo de Comércio Livre UE-Japão (ACL), promovendo assim uma integração económica mais estreita entre os dois parceiros comerciais estratégicos. O sistema multilateral de comércio representado pela Organização Mundial do Comércio continua a ser de longe o quadro mais eficaz para se atingir um comércio justo e aberto a nível mundial.
Apoiei este documento, porque a proposta da Comissão de revogação do Regulamento (CE) n.º 1541/98 do Conselho e de alteração do Regulamento (CEE) n.º 3030/93 do Conselho se deve ao compromisso político da União Europeia de simplificar a legislação em vigor tendo em vista a criação de um enquadramento legislativo melhor e mais claro para as empresas, principalmente no que diz respeito à simplificação das formalidades aduaneiras seguidas pelos importadores de determinados produtos têxteis introduzidos em livre prática na Comunidade, abrangidos pela secção XI da Nomenclatura Combinada.
Apoiei este relatório devido à necessidade de promover um quadro para a melhoria dos sistemas de educação e formação na Europa. A iniciativa Juventude em Movimento tem de ser uma acção política destinada a promover programas de educação, mobilidade e emprego para os jovens de hoje e funcionar como um incentivo a que os Estados-Membros cumpram as metas da Estratégia "Europa 2020”.
Apoiei este relatório, que reafirma as nossas ambições para os jovens da Europa. A Estratégia "Europa 2020” coloca a educação dos jovens no centro dos seus objectivos e propõe metas para 2020: uma redução do abandono escolar precoce de 15% para 10% e um aumento da percentagem de pessoas com um diploma do ensino superior de 31% para 40%. Contudo, gostaria de insistir num ponto: os obstáculos à mobilidade dos jovens.
Apoiei este relatório, tal como apoio o pacote de governação económica no seu conjunto.
Apoiei igualmente a proposta de afectar as receitas obtidas com a cobrança da Eurovinheta a investimentos em infra-estruturas rodoviárias e de utilizá-las para tornar os transportes menos poluentes. A promoção do transporte sustentável é um elemento-chave da política comum de transportes.
Apoiei o Acordo em apreço, entre a União Europeia e a República da Croácia, bem como a participação desta última nas actividades do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência, a qual irá possibilitar a recolha, a nível europeu, de informação factual e objectiva sobre o país, no que respeita às drogas, à toxicodependência e às respectivas consequências, permitindo, ao mesmo tempo, que a República da Croácia obtenha informações sobre as melhores práticas para compreender a natureza dos seus problemas de droga e reagir a estes da melhor forma.
Apoiei o presente relatório porque o sistema internacional está a atravessar uma mudança rápida e profunda, guiada pela transferência de poder para actores internacionais emergentes, e está a aprofundar a interdependência, que abrange problemas económicos e financeiros, deterioração do ambiente e alterações climáticas, escassez de energia e de recursos e os desafios inter-relacionados em matéria de segurança. Num contexto global turbulento e em plena crise económica e financeira, a União Europeia é chamada a reforçar a sua autonomia estratégica para preservar os seus valores, perseguir os seus interesses e proteger os seus cidadãos, desenvolvendo uma visão comum dos principais desafios e ameaças e reunindo as suas capacidades e recursos para lhes dar resposta adequada, contribuindo deste modo para preservar a paz internacional e a estabilidade global, nomeadamente aplicando um multilateralismo efectivo.
Apoiei o presente relatório que insta à criação de um registo comum dos representantes de interesses e grupos de interesse.
Apoiei o programa para a política do espectro radioeléctrico da Comissão porque acredito que todos os cidadãos da UE deveriam ter acesso a uma ligação mais rápida de banda larga até 2020. O programa para a política do espectro radioeléctrico garantirá que o fosso digital seja reduzido através da introdução de medidas que proporcionem um acesso mais rápido à Web para todos os cidadãos e empresas.
Apoiei o relatório do deputado Mitchell porque considero que devemos reforçar a participação dos Parlamentos dos países em desenvolvimento na elaboração dos documentos de estratégia para esses países, nomeadamente o relativo à estratégia de erradicação da pobreza.
Apoiei o relatório do nosso colega Richard Falbr porque considero que a União deve promover as mais elevadas normas laborais e sociais em países terceiros a fim de manter a sua credibilidade no comércio internacional e de estreitar laços com os seus principais parceiros comerciais. O relator recomenda relações equilibradas com as ONG e com as organizações internacionais para facilitar a ratificação das convenções. Para negociar com a UE, os países terceiros devem respeitar as normas laborais instituídas.
Apoiei o relatório do senhor deputado Alexander Graf Lambsdorff porque considero que devemos promover uma maior coesão entre as posições dos Estados-Membros e reforçar a sua capacidade de negociação com outros grupos regionais.
Apoiei o relatório do senhor deputado Zahradil porque penso que o Regulamento (CE) n.º 1541/98 do Conselho relativo à prova de origem de determinados produtos têxteis serviu o seu propósito. O Regulamento do Conselho de 1998 introduziu instrumentos para o controlo da importação de produtos têxteis, que possibilitaram a implementação do Acordo da OMC.
Apoiei o relatório em apreço, em virtude de a avaliação ex-post do acordo confirmar que este permite manter a presença das frotas da UE na região, favorecendo, ao mesmo tempo, a criação de emprego a nível local; um dos motivos que me levou a apoiar o acordo foi o facto de o mesmo contribuir substancialmente para a estabilização do mercado europeu das conservas de atum.
Apoiei o relatório em apreço, pois o valor acrescentado da participação da UE em organizações multilaterais reside nas matérias em que esta tem competências exclusivas ou partilhadas: assuntos económicos e comerciais, política ambiental, ajuda ao desenvolvimento e política de segurança e defesa. O Tratado de Lisboa, ao conferir personalidade jurídica à União, reforça a capacidade da UE para aderir a várias organizações internacionais, dota-a de um mais vasto leque de competências a nível da sua acção externa, permite-lhe, nomeadamente através da criação do cargo de Vice-Presidente da Comissão/Alto Representante da União para os Negócios Estrangeiros e a Política de Segurança (VP/AR) e do Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa (SEAE), intervir a uma só voz, mais clara e mais forte, no mundo, encoraja todos os tipos de cooperação mutuamente benéfica entre a UE e organizações internacionais e regionais e grupos de Estados pertinentes, e ainda permite à União organizar-se de modo a poder tornar-se um verdadeiro actor a nível mundial.
Apoiei o relatório proposto porque considero que a criação de agências de notação de crédito incrementará a concorrência no sector, o que constitui uma condição necessária para aumentar a qualidade, reduzir os custos da informação e, por último mas não menos importante, aumentar a responsabilização das agências relevantes.
Apoiei o relatório sobre a proposta de decisão do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho que estabelece o primeiro programa do espectro radioeléctrico.
Apoiei o relatório sobre as dimensões culturais das acções externas da UE. Quero sublinhar, em especial, a necessidade de uma revisão dos programas em vigor com uma componente cultural e da elaboração de um Livro Verde e uma comunicação da Comissão que tracem políticas concretas para o papel da cultura nas acções externas da UE. Actualmente, a cooperação cultural entre Estados-Membros e países terceiros é levada a cabo a nível bilateral.
Apoiei o relatório, porque, como sabemos, a principal tarefa do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência consiste em recolher dados sobre a droga e a toxicodependência para elaborar e publicar informações objectivas, fiáveis e comparáveis a nível europeu.
Apoiei o texto em debate porque advoga o fomento de um multilateralismo efectivo como a preocupação estratégica primordial da União e o reforço da coerência e da visibilidade da UE enquanto actor mundial na ONU, nomeadamente através de uma melhor coordenação das consultas internas sobre questões relativas às Nações Unidas e da promoção de um maior envolvimento num vasto leque de questões. Defende ainda que se estabeleçam relações com parceiros estratégicos da UE no sistema da ONU e se imprima uma dimensão multilateral às parcerias estratégicas, inscrevendo as questões globais na ordem dos trabalhos das cimeiras bilaterais e multilaterais da UE, e que seja dado um contributo para melhorar a eficácia e a transparência da ONU e reforçar a gestão dos seus recursos financeiros.
Apoiei também a proposta de não permitir a exportação de resíduos a não ser para fins de reciclagem, na condição expressa de eles serem subsequentemente reimportados para a UE. Esta posição foi apoiada por maioria, facto com que me congratulo.
Apoio a aprovação do Protocolo anexo ao Acordo de Parceria no domínio da pesca entre a União Europeia e a República Democrática de São Tomé e Príncipe por este dizer respeito ao desenvolvimento de relações, com um país terceiro num espírito de cooperação e parceria, no sentido de reforçar a exploração sustentável dos recursos fora das águas da UE, tendo em consideração, simultaneamente, questões de ordem económica, social e ambiental. O novo Protocolo prevê uma contrapartida financeira para o acesso à ZEE de São Tomé e Príncipe correspondente às possibilidades de pesca no valor de EUR 2 047 500 por um período de três anos.
Apoio a atribuição excepcional do título de Capital Europeia da Cultura a esta cidade em 2014. A iniciativa que, há mais de 25 anos, promove as riquezas e a diversidade das culturas europeias, contribuirá igualmente para a reconstrução da indústria turística desta cidade e da sua base económica.
Apoio a criação de um quadro jurídico sólido para as contas económicas do ambiente da União Europeia e encorajo a compilação de estatísticas fiáveis e harmonizadas.
Apoio a iniciativa da Comissão no sentido de providenciar no sentido de a solidez das instituições financeiras e do sistema financeiro em geral, bem como o seu sistema de regulação e supervisão, serem objecto de um exame crítico, a fim de impedir que a crise se venha a repetir no futuro e de assegurar que o sector financeiro responde às necessidades da economia real e dá mostras do maior grau possível de responsabilidade social.
Apoio a opinião da relatora de que devemos favorecer a opção de criação de um instrumento facultativo (IF) através de um regulamento.
Apoio a posição segundo a qual a actual austeridade económica e as disposições do Tratado de Lisboa poderão contribuir para induzir os Estados-Membros a racionalizar as despesas com a defesa, reunindo e partilhando uma parte mais significativa das suas capacidades de defesa, dos seus orçamentos e exigências, reforçando simultaneamente a segurança dos seus cidadãos, embora a realidade seja que a crise económica e financeira afecta os orçamentos, programas e estruturas das forças de defesa nacionais da UE e por isso, mais de um ano após a entrada em vigor do Tratado de Lisboa, não existem ainda sinais claros de uma abordagem global da UE pós-Lisboa no âmbito da qual os tradicionais obstáculos institucionais e processuais possam ser ultrapassados.
Apoio a presente proposta de recomendação do Parlamento Europeu ao Conselho referente à próxima sessão da Assembleia Geral das Nações Unidas. A proposta sublinha que a União Europeia e as Nações Unidas partilham um compromisso em matéria de promoção da democracia, do respeito dos direitos humanos e da paz na comunidade internacional. A proposta refere que o alargamento do Conselho de Segurança das Nações Unidas de modo a incluir a UE é um factor fundamental para a concretização dos objectivos acima referidos. A proposta rejeita o pedido da Alemanha para ocupar o novo potencial lugar da UE nas Nações Unidas com carácter permanente e, em vez disso, incorpora a proposta da Itália com vista a permitir que todos os Estados-Membros ocupem o lugar num sistema de rotatividade, a fim de respeitar o princípio da igual dignidade de todos os Estados-Membros.
Apoio a proposta de decisão do Conselho relativa à assinatura, em nome da União, de um Acordo entre a União Europeia e a República da Croácia sobre a participação da República da Croácia nos trabalhos do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência. O meu apoio justifica-se pelo facto de o número de mortes ter diminuído para todas as drogas, à excepção da heroína, em comparação com o ano anterior; e também pelo facto de, em geral, se terem registado progressos na luta contra o consumo de drogas.
Apoio a proposta do relatório no sentido de, para reduzir tais desigualdades e fazer convergir o processo de integração europeia para todos os Estados-Membros, precisarmos de reduzir o período exigido para a aprovação de financiamentos e de eliminar burocracia e todas as regras e procedimentos que a acompanham e que, desnecessariamente, entravam a política de coesão da União Europeia, em vez de a ajudarem.
Apoio a proposta segundo a qual a Bulgária e a Roménia devem informar o Parlamento Europeu e o Conselho, por escrito, num prazo de seis meses, sobre as medidas adicionais que tencionem tomar no que respeita às recomendações, contidas nos relatórios de avaliação e mencionadas nos relatórios de acompanhamento, que estejam ainda por aplicar.
Apoio a resolução sobre a renovação do Protocolo ao Acordo de Parceria no domínio da pesca entre a UE e a Mauritânia porque o acordo se baseia no princípio das existências excedentárias, que é compatível com a estratégia de gestão sustentável das pescas da UE. Além disso, a Mauritânia é um dos países mais pobres do mundo, classificado como País Pobre Altamente Endividado.
Apoio as conclusões do relatório do Grupo Confederal da Esquerda Unitária Europeia/Esquerda Nórdica Verde, mas é necessário que estas conclusões sejam acompanhadas por uma análise circunstanciada dos planos.
Apoio as recomendações plasmadas no presente relatório no sentido de congregarmos sinergias através da criação de um instrumento estratégico que abarque todos os fundos estruturais e direccionado para a inovação e o desenvolvimento tecnológico, apoiando as empresas, sobretudo as PME, e reduzindo os custos administrativos.
Apoio claramente o seu desejo de legislar no sentido de conseguir que a Europa cumpra os desafios tecnológicos neste sector e mantenha uma posição de liderança a nível mundial.
Apoio convictamente o apelo que o Parlamento dirigiu ontem à Federação Internacional de Hóquei no Gelo para que a Bielorrússia perca o direito a organizar o Campeonato Mundial de 2014 se não libertar todos os seus prisioneiros políticos. A UE deveria igualmente impor sanções económicas direccionadas e intensificar o seu apoio às ONG na Bielorrússia.
Apoio efusivamente os meus colegas que afirmaram que temos de passar da teoria à prática no que toca à liberalização do regime de vistos, e não apenas em relação à Rússia, mas a todos os vizinhos orientais da União Europeia.
Apoio esta medida porque, através de uma maior consideração das condições dos Estados-Membros, será possível avaliar as possíveis consequências sociais, ambientais, financeiras e económicas de um acto jurídico.
Apoio esta resolução, pelo facto de ela apontar uma série de medidas eficazes para recolha de um espectro de dados mais alargado.
Apoio este relatório da minha colega de grupo, porque salienta a transversalidade e a importância da cultura em todas as facetas da vida e defende a necessidade de ela ser tida em conta em todas as políticas externas da UE.
Apoio este relatório porque esta proposta se limita a uma codificação pura e simples dos textos existentes, sem qualquer alteração do seu conteúdo.
Apoio este relatório sobre as futuras agências de notação de crédito. A recente crise financeira demonstrou que o sector padece de problemas graves, nomeadamente o excesso de confiança do sistema regulamentar nas notações de crédito externas e a ausência de responsabilização das ANC por essas notações. Efectivamente, as ANC desempenharam um papel significativo no caminho que levou à crise financeira, atribuindo notações incorrectas a instrumentos financeiros estruturados. O presente relatório, em antecipação da proposta legislativa que a Comissão está a preparar para o Outono, aborda estas questões e solicita: a verificação se e como os Estados-Membros usam notações para fins regulamentares, a fim de reduzir o excesso de confiança geral nestas notações por parte do sistema regulamentar financeiro; um estudo de impacto detalhado sobre os custos, os benefícios e a potencial estrutura de governação de uma Fundação Europeia de Notação de Crédito totalmente independente; a exploração da criação de uma Agência Europeia de Notação de Risco verdadeiramente independente; o estabelecimento de um Índice de Notação Europeu, que inclua todas as notações de ANC registadas existentes no mercado.
Apoio este relatório, pois entendo que a coesão territorial deve ser apoiada adequadamente através da atribuição de maiores fundos estruturais, e é por isso correcto que a parte destinada ao Objectivo 3 seja aumentada, passando dos actuais 2,5% para 7%, considerando além disso que cerca de 37,5% da população europeia vive em regiões fronteiriças. A atribuição de maiores recursos significaria, em primeiro lugar, investir nas redes transeuropeias de transporte (RTE-T), em relação às quais a modernização é uma prioridade urgente; e, em segundo lugar, proceder à redução dos obstáculos físicos, culturais, administrativos e de regulamentação que dificultam a cooperação e a coesão territorial.
Apoio este relatório, que incide sobre o desempenho do instrumento financeiro, o controlo e a promoção de uma utilização mais eficaz, no futuro, do dinheiro destinado ao desenvolvimento.
Apoio este relatório, que insta os Estados-Membros a garantirem que as pessoas tenham acesso, em diferentes fases da sua vida, a ensino e a formação profissionais adaptados às suas necessidades, de modo a facilitar e estimular a sua participação no mercado de trabalho e na sociedade em geral. O ensino e a formação profissionais devem ser acessíveis e estar disponíveis a um preço razoável em todas as fases da vida das pessoas, independentemente do seu estatuto no mercado de trabalho e dos seus rendimentos.
Apoio este relatório, que recomenda várias acções concretas, incluindo a criação de um índice ambiental, a publicação mais atempada dos dados ambientais e sociais, a comunicação de informações mais rigorosas sobre as disparidades sociais e o alargamento do sistema de contas nacionais às questões ambientais e sociais.
Apoio fervorosamente a inclusão da vertente cultural no projecto de organigrama do Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa (SEAE). É igualmente importante proporcionar formação adequada ao pessoal do SEAE sobre os aspectos culturais e digitais. A cultura também é um factor importante na luta pelos direitos humanos e no apoio à democracia.
Apoio firmemente a decisão de solicitar um aumento dos recursos para o próximo quadro financeiro plurianual de, pelo menos, 5 %. Além disso, gostaria de destacar a parte do relatório relativa à política agrícola comum, tendo em conta o meu papel de relator de parecer da Comissão da Agricultura e do Desenvolvimento Rural.
Apoio firmemente o relatório, que solicita melhor coordenação de ambas. A organização de reuniões regulares de um Conselho de Gestão de Crises que coopere com o SEAE é de importância crucial para isso.
Apoio medidas de diplomacia cultural, que também podem ser auxiliadas pelo trabalho das delegações parlamentares.
Apoio o apelo para que o Canadá retire a queixa apresentada na OMC relativamente à proibição de produtos derivados da foca aplicada pela UE e fico satisfeito por o Parlamento ter aprovado alterações sublinhando esta posição. A Comissão também deve assumir uma posição firme em defesa dessa proibição. Os direitos de propriedade intelectual devem igualmente ser protegidos, através do recurso às marcas registadas e às patentes.
Apoio o desenvolvimento de planos de mobilidade urbana integrados e incentivo as autoridades locais a modernizarem os transportes públicos urbanos para os tornarem mais amigos do ambiente e eficientes. A implementação de sistemas de transporte inteligentes (STI) nas áreas urbanas aumentará a eficiência energética e a segurança dos transportes.
Apoio o pedido de realização de mais investigação no domínio do bem-estar animal e das práticas agrícolas, como a melhoria da criação dos rebanhos, a prevenção precoce da doença e a criação de raças robustas de animais.
Apoio o princípio do "poluidor-pagador", sendo que não deveremos, em caso algum, eximir-nos às nossas responsabilidades.
Apoio o relatório Ford sobre os requisitos para quadros orçamentais dos Estados Membros.
Apoio o relatório Klinz a fim de avançar no processo de reforma das agências de notação. Se a primeira iniciativa legislativa submeteu essas agências a regulamentação e supervisão e a segunda clarificou os poderes de supervisão da Autoridade Europeia dos Valores Mobiliários e dos Mercados (ESMA), a actual resolução defende a diminuição da dependência regulamentar das notações externas, a estruturação do sector num quadro de concorrência e a melhoria dos seus modelos de negócio em linha com os critérios do Fórum de Estabilidade Financeira.
Apoio o relatório da Deputada Elisa Ferreira sobre a prevenção e correcção de desequilíbrios macroeconómicos.
Apoio o relatório porque contempla a dimensão em termos de género da PAC.
Apoio o relatório sobre a avaliação intercalar do Sétimo Programa-Quadro da União Europeia de actividades em matéria de investigação, desenvolvimento tecnológico e demonstração porque considero que reflecte verdadeiramente o que foi alcançado, bem como os problemas existentes. A União Europeia tem o potencial para se tornar líder mundial em inovação e invenções. Isso representaria um novo ímpeto para o nosso crescimento económico e uma melhoria do nível de vida dos nossos cidadãos. Temos a possibilidade de cumprir esse objectivo através de uma série de tarefas domésticas, a mais importante das quais é a redução dos obstáculos burocráticos.
Apoio o texto em apreço porque a UE e o Canadá têm uma relação estreita em matéria de comércio e investimento directo estrangeiro.
Apoio o trabalho realizado pelo relator no relatório em apreço. Partilho das suas preocupações relativamente ao facto de a Comissão ter entregado a sua comunicação muito mais tarde do que se comprometera. O PQ7 apresentou trabalho de excelente qualidade e sinto-me encorajada pelo trabalho levado a cabo pelo relator com vista a fechar o triângulo de ouro.
Apoio plenamente a adopção, ratificação e implementação pela Organização Internacional do Trabalho (OIT) de uma convenção sobre o trabalho doméstico.
Apoio plenamente a criação de uma categoria intermédia de regiões. Esta medida aplicar-se-ia a todas as regiões em que o PIB per capita se situa abaixo dos 75% a 90% do PIB da União. Serviria para criar um melhor equilíbrio entre as regiões. Esta proposta põe em prática o princípio da coesão territorial previsto no 174.º do Tratado sobre o Funcionamento da União Europeia.
Apoio plenamente as considerações constantes do relatório sobre os objectivos gerais e as missões da PAC e concordo que não devem ser efectuados cortes no financiamento consagrado à PAC para 2013, para que ela possa responder adequadamente a essas necessidades alargadas.
Apoio plenamente o apelo a que os fundos consagrados à PAC no exercício de 2013 sejam mantidos ao mesmo nível durante o próximo período de programação financeira, para que a PAC possa cumprir os seus objectivos alargados e as suas missões. O novo sistema de financiamento da UE deve ser mais transparente, mais simples e mais justo.
Apoio plenamente o apelo constante do relatório no sentido de associar a agricultura à estratégia Europa 2020, pois acredito firmemente que o sector agrícola e alimentar pode dar um contributo valioso para o crescimento económico na Irlanda e em toda a Europa.
Apoio plenamente o sistema mundial de navegação por satélite europeu autónomo e concordo com a tomada de todas as medidas essenciais para assegurar a sua capacidade operacional plena.
Apoio sem reservas o texto do relatório que solicita que a nova PAC preveja os instrumentos necessários para limitar a volatilidade dos preços. Concluo com uma observação sobre o tipo de produção agrícola mais comum na minha região, a produção de azeite, e com uma chamada de atenção para a medida que aguardamos da Comissão: um sistema actualizado de armazenamento privado e a introdução do armazenamento privado.
Apoio também o facto de a iniciativa Juventude em Movimento procurar assegurar uma educação que satisfaça as necessidades do mercado de trabalho.
Apoio totalmente a nova directiva, pois substituirá os diversos actos nela integrados. A presente proposta preserva integralmente o conteúdo dos actos codificados, limitando-se a reuni-los apenas com as alterações formais exigidas pelo próprio processo de codificação. Votei a favor.
Apoio, assim, as condições baseadas nos valores sociais e de dignidade humana impostas a países terceiros para negociar com a UE. É através deste tipo de união que teremos sucesso nas políticas externas a fim de melhorar o cenário global.
Apoio, assim, este relatório que pretende definir alguns princípios gerais e um conjunto de normas coerente para a avaliação destes acordos, ressalvando a importância de o PE ser mantido informado e poder acompanhar o processo desde o seu início, sendo-lhe dada a oportunidade de expressar as suas preocupações e prioridades.
Apoio, da mesma forma, a decisão sobre a mobilização do FEG a favor da Bélgica, em prol dos trabalhadores do sector automóvel, através de medidas que formam um conjunto coordenado de serviços personalizados destinados a reintegrar os trabalhadores no mercado de trabalho.
Apoio, em especial, a ideia de uma "pegada legislativa", que permita que os representantes de grupos de interesses ("lobbyists") com quem os eurodeputados se reúnem durante o processo legislativo fiquem registados.
Apoio, por conseguinte, a decisão de realizar testes de resistência às centrais nucleares no território da UE. Estes testes não serão obrigatórios, porém, e não haverá consequências para aqueles que não participem neles.
Apoio, por isso, a cooperação internacional eficaz na luta contra o comércio ilegal de drogas ou dos seus precursores e, ao mesmo tempo, gostaria de referir a necessidade da prevenção.
Apoiámos esta resolução e apresentámos uma pergunta à Comissão, pois consideramos que a mesma é fundamental neste momento em que os preços do petróleo têm vindo a atingir desde alguns meses os níveis mais elevados de sempre.
Apoiámos firmemente este relatório tendo em consideração o compromisso estratégico da UE de simplificar a legislação em vigor. O nosso objectivo é criar um enquadramento legislativo melhor e mais claro para as empresas.
Aponta nesse sentido a importante proposta da Comissão de 4 de Maio de 2011, que torna o espaço Schengen mais flexível e concertado com vista a uma gestão regular dos fluxos migratórios internos. A proposta visa uma governação reforçada, que deve, certamente, ser tida em consideração em momentos de particular crise.
Apraz-me - como disse anteriormente na minha primeira intervenção - que os representantes da Presidência húngara estejam aqui presentes connosco esta manhã. Não é algo que podemos dar por garantido quando se trata de debates que incluam a quitação pela execução do orçamento do Conselho.
Apraz-me ainda constatar a aprovação das propostas apresentadas pela minha família política - em particular no que respeita à criação de um fundo europeu para o financiamento da inovação, que irá simplificar o acesso aos créditos europeus por parte das nossas pequenas e médias empresas (PME). A libertação da capacidade de inovação na Europa exige o estabelecimento de um limite de despesas mínimo no que toca à investigação e ao desenvolvimento em cada um dos Estados-Membros.
Apraz-me anunciar que o Grupo de Avaliação de Shengen (SCH-EVAL) concluiu agora que a Bulgária fez esse trabalho.
Apraz-me constatar que muitos dos pontos assinalados pelo Conselho foram também tidos em consideração pela vossa instituição. O Conselho recomendou que se concedesse a quitação à Comissão, e reconheceu as melhorias globais identificadas pelo Tribunal.
Apraz-me dizer que o nosso novo governo anunciou, ontem, medidas de ajuda às PME, que foram amplamente saudadas pela comunidade empresarial - medidas relacionadas com o IVA, Segurança Social, taxas de viagem e estágios. A nível europeu, o combate à fraude é uma questão essencial. A economia de mercado paralelo prospera, sendo, por isso, um problema que cumpre resolver à escala europeia. É igualmente necessário incentivar as empresas a aproveitaram plenamente as oportunidades no domínio do comércio electrónico e a estabelecerem uma patente europeia.
Apraz-me muito a abordagem adoptada pelo meu colega Chatzimarkakis.
Apraz-me o facto de o Parlamento Europeu estar a pronunciar-se sobre as actuais negociações comerciais entre o Canadá e a UE e a delinear as suas prioridades neste tocante. O Canadá é incontestavelmente um parceiro comercial da UE, mas é imperativo que o Parlamento transmita as preocupações dos nossos concidadãos localizados tanto no território europeu como nas regiões que fazem parte da família europeia, nomeadamente, a protecção e a defesa dos seus interesses.
Apraz-me particularmente ver que o relatório inclui a alteração que apresentei em relação à Geórgia. O meu objectivo foi frisar a importância de exercer pressão política constante e coerente sobre a Rússia para pôr em vigor todas as disposições do acordo de 2008, incluindo, em particular, autorizar a entrada da Missão de Vigilância da União Europeia (EUMM) nos territórios ocupados.
Apraz-me que a Comissão esteja disposta, pelo menos, a apresentar uma avaliação do impacto até Setembro de 2013, a qual, para além do país de origem, se concentrará também em métodos harmonizados para o tratamento de produtos, a indicação de tamanhos e a inclusão de informações sobre substâncias perigosas, alergénios, inflamabilidade, etc.
Apraz-me que a Comissão recomende iniciativas aos Estados-Membros, no entanto, creio que nalguns Estados-Membros será necessário apoio financeiro para a formação destas pessoas e para as manter na Europa, pois creio que, mais do os mercados laborais europeus, serão alimentados os mercados laborais da Austrália e de outros países.
Apraz-me que a comissão tenha aprovado o relatório, depois de muita deliberação, e estou ciente, graças aos colegas da comissão, do trabalho minucioso efectuado para tentar apresentar um resultado que fosse aceitável.
Apraz-me que este assunto esteja a ser discutido no caso vertente, e verifico que melhorámos, de facto, algumas coisas nessa matéria. A proposta foi tratada pela Comissão do Mercado Interno e da Protecção dos Consumidores.
Apraz-me que o senhor deputado David e outros tenham conseguido reunir um pacote que mereceu o apoio de uma ampla maioria em comissão. A este respeito, gostaria de chamar em especial a atenção para a limitação que gostaríamos de ver em termos temporais.
Apraz-me ver que esta abordagem ocupa um lugar de topo na agenda das discussões em curso, e que as propostas que estão sobre a mesa correspondem de facto às ambições da Comissão.
Apraz-me verificar que a relatora seguiu a posição da Comissão do Emprego e dos Assuntos Sociais a este respeito e a incluiu no relatório. É chegado o momento de a Comissão e os Estados-Membros solucionarem estas lacunas sociais e prometerem às mentes criativas europeias que os artistas criativos da Europa não têm de viver como uma classe inferior.
Apraz-nos constatar que tal papel ganha contornos cada vez mais definidos. A situação líbia veio também confirmar a inadequação da capacidade militar europeia, que é bem inferior ao nível globalmente elevado dos orçamentos de defesa nacionais.
Apraz-nos que a Comissão tenha tomado esta iniciativa legislativa em Abril de 2010, mas, na nossa opinião, fê-lo de modo demasiado hesitante. Nós, no Parlamento, e todos os grupos políticos solicitamos que isto seja feito de forma muito mais rápida, porque a Organização de Cooperação e de Desenvolvimento Económicos (OCDE) e as Nações Unidas já estão a discutir estas matérias há 15 anos.
Apraz-nos registar a visita do Senhor Presidente da Comissão e de colegas nossos, deputados, ao Sudão, bem como as actividades da senhora deputada Véronique De Keyser.
Apreciamos, pois, a prudência com que o Senhor Comissário abordou a questão e convidamos o Parlamento, no seu todo, a seguir essa abordagem, que inspirou a proposta de resolução apresentada pelo nosso grupo.
Apreciei o método seguido pelo relator na avaliação dos resultados e das modalidades de cooperação da UE para o desenvolvimento. O relator afirma claramente que, apesar do diálogo construtivo com a Comissão, esta não alterou a sua atitude em matéria de desenvolvimento na sequência da recomendação do Parlamento. A posição do Parlamento raras vezes foi reflectida nos projectos de medidas de execução que a Comissão submeteu ao Comité de Gestão do ICD.
Aprendemos por experiência e senso comum que a solução reside na reforma interna do Estado devedor, com a consciencialização por parte dos credores de que a dívida terá de ser ajustada à capacidade efectiva de pagamento do país em questão. Se não for este o nosso procedimento, não pouparemos tempo - será uma perda de tempo e o problema agravar-se-á.
Aprender uma nova língua e descobrir outra cultura são vantagens que devem ser acessíveis a todos.
Apresentam um quadro jurídico claro destinado a reforçar as suas capacidades na condução da sua política externa e de segurança através de uma abordagem exaustiva, servindo-se de todos os instrumentos à disposição da União e dos seus Estados-Membros, a fim de prevenir e gerir crises e conflitos e construir uma paz duradoura.
Apresentamos também propostas melhoradas com vista a uma maior eficiência e transparência. É para nós da maior importância garantir que a concessão de financiamento esteja subordinada a condições mais duras. Há que implementar a legislação da UE antes de disponibilizar fundos da UE. Isto aplica-se aos contratos públicos e à regulação dos preços. Queremos também um controlo significativamente mais rigoroso sobre a concessão de ajudas.
Apresentei uma alteração para reduzir o orçamento em 2,8 %, que é a taxa média das irregularidades no orçamento da UE, como assinalado pelo Tribunal de Contas Europeu.
Apresento os meus agradecimentos ao relator, senhor deputado Albert Dess, por ter realizado muitíssimo bem um trabalho difícil e complicado.
Apresentámos igualmente uma alteração em que exigimos que a Comissão Europeia, uma vez concluídas as avaliações pelos pares, avalie o conceito de gestão de resíduos radioactivos e de combustível irradiado.
Aprova-se o relatório em apreço, tendo em conta que, com as necessárias negociações, o relator teve a oportunidade de assegurar a inclusão de uma cláusula de revisão para o regulamento referido para possível introdução, após um relatório de implementação pela Comissão, de novos modelos que cobrem uma variedade de bens ambientais.
Aprovamos, portanto, a participação da República da Croácia nos trabalhos do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência.
Aprovei este documento porque o Tratado da União Europeia e, nomeadamente, os n.ºs 1 e 2 do seu artigo artigo 11.º, fornecem um enquadramento para as relações entre, por um lado, as Instituições europeias e os líderes políticos europeus e, por outro, a sociedade civil, os cidadãos da UE e as associações representativas, bem como para a promoção dessas relações: 1. As instituições, recorrendo aos meios adequados, dão aos cidadãos e às associações representativas a possibilidade de expressarem e partilharem publicamente os seus pontos de vista em todos os domínios de acção da União. 2. As instituições estabelecem um diálogo aberto, transparente e regular com as associações representativas e com a sociedade civil.
Aprovei este documento porque, a 14 de Junho de 2010, a Comissão publicou o seu Plano de Acção relativo às Aplicações do Sistema Global de Navegação por Satélite (GNSS), que incluía 24 recomendações de acção específicas. O plano de acção foi elaborado tendo em conta a implantação geral dos sistemas globais de navegação por satélite e, especificamente, o desenvolvimento e utilização do EGNOS (Serviço Europeu Complementar de Navegação Geoestacionária). O EGNOS é o precursor do sistema Galileo.
Aprovei o presente documento porque a União Europeia é a maior fonte de investimento directo estrangeiro (IDE) na Índia.
Aproveito esta oportunidade para realçar que estou ciente de que o Conselho foi convidado a participar no registo em matéria de transparência.
Aproveitámos as alterações apresentadas para pedir a superação do fosso digital de modo a que os cidadãos da União Europeia tenham acesso à infra-estrutura de comunicações em banda larga a, pelo menos, 30 Mbps até 2020, e que esse aumento das capacidades da banda larga garanta oportunidades tanto para o sector comercial como para o dos serviços públicos.
Aprovo a nova redacção da Comissão, tendo em conta o Acordo Interinstitucional, de 20 de Dezembro de 1994, sobre um método de trabalho acelerado tendo em vista a codificação oficial dos textos legislativos e, nomeadamente, o ponto 4, o Grupo Consultivo, constituído por elementos dos serviços jurídicos do Parlamento Europeu, do Conselho e da Comissão. Este grupo reuniu-se em 23 de Novembro de 2010 para analisar a proposta supramencionada, apresentada pela Comissão. Ao proceder à análise da proposta de directiva do Conselho que codifica a Directiva 92/79/CEE do Conselho, de 19 de Outubro de 1992, relativa à aproximação dos impostos sobre os cigarros, a Directiva 92/80/CEE do Conselho, de 19 de Outubro de 1992, relativa à aproximação dos impostos sobre os tabacos manufacturados que não sejam cigarros, e a Directiva 95/59/CE do Conselho, de 27 de Novembro de 1995, relativa aos impostos que incidem sobre o consumo de tabacos manufacturados, com excepção dos impostos sobre o volume de negócios, o Grupo Consultivo observou, de comum acordo, que a proposta em apreço se cinge à codificação pura e simples dos textos existentes, sem alterações substantivas.
Aprovo a presente nomeação para Presidente do Banco Central Europeu, tendo em conta as competências do candidato e a sua ampla experiência adquirida ao longo dos anos.
Aprovo a presente proposta com as alterações do Grupo S&D. A proposta da Comissão estabelece requisitos específicos para garantir que os Estados-Membros estabeleçam um quadro regulamentar nacional e organizacional e elaborem programas nacionais adequados para o combustível irradiado e os resíduos radioactivos, a partir de sua geração, e o seu encaminhamento.
Aprovo a presente proposta de resolução, considerando que é fundamental procurar o justo equilíbrio entre acordos multilaterais, bilaterais e plurilaterais.
Aprovo a presente proposta e recomendo que se tomem medidas para obviar à dificuldade em encontrar profissionais para as missões civis que constituem a forma de intervenção mais utilizada.
Aprovo a presente proposta no sentido de incentivar a Comissão a prosseguir o seu trabalho sobre este importante dossiê, com base nas alterações adoptadas pelo Parlamento em primeira leitura, esperando que o Conselho adopte uma abordagem no mesmo sentido, de promover o acesso a todo o tipo de informações relevantes relativas aos produtos têxteis.
Aprovo a presente proposta tendo em conta que a crise está a eliminar milhões de empregos e tem agravado a precariedade do emprego e a pobreza; que 17 % dos habitantes da UE estão em risco de pobreza; e que 23 milhões de habitantes da UE estão desempregados e que grande parte do trabalho doméstico se processa no âmbito da economia informal, em condições de emprego precárias e/ou como trabalho não declarado e que, para além disso, nos países industrializados, o trabalho doméstico representa entre 5 e 9 % de todo o emprego, que a grande maioria dos trabalhadores que este sector emprega são mulheres e que este trabalho é subavaliado, mal remunerado e informal, e que a vulnerabilidade dos trabalhadores domésticos significa que são amiúde objecto de discriminação desleal ou abusiva.
Aprovo a presente proposta, concordando com o relator que sustenta que a união faz a força. Unirmo-nos para inovar, encontrando soluções para problemas comuns na Europa, significa desenvolvimentos mais rápidos, eficiência (de custos) e mais força criativa. A União da Inovação deve também fortalecer a força competitiva da Europa, ajudando a encontrar um caminho para sair da crise económica.
Aprovo a presente proposta, considerando que a resistência antimicrobiana (RAM) representa um problema de saúde animal para o sector europeu da pecuária, em particular quando o tratamento não é bem sucedido; que já foram publicadas em vários Estados-Membros orientações sobre o uso prudente de antibióticos, o que levou a um decréscimo na utilização de antimicrobianos, e que o sector da pecuária (produção de leite, de carne bovina, de carne de porco e de aves, de ovos, leite de ovelha, de leite de cabra e de carne) desempenha um papel importante na economia agrícola europeia e que o objectivo primeiro dos agricultores é manter os seus animais saudáveis e produtivos através de boas práticas agrícolas (higiene, alimentação e criação adequadas, gestão responsável da saúde dos animais). Solicito assim à Comissão que desenvolva um vasto plano de acção plurianual contra a resistência antimicrobiana no quadro da Estratégia da UE em matéria de Saúde Animal (2011-2015).
Aprovo a presente proposta, considerando que beneficiará a UE, uma vez que um mercado de contratos públicos que funcione bem é essencial para promover o mercado único, estimular a inovação, promover um elevado nível de protecção ambiental e climática, bem como a inclusão social em toda a UE. Particularmente tendo em vista a necessidade de superar a crise financeira e económica e de nos protegermos contra eventuais futuras crises, os contratos públicos são de relevância crucial, servindo de catalisador para a revitalização da economia da UE e, consequentemente, para o emprego e o bem-estar.
Aprovo a presente proposta, considerando que é necessária a aplicação de uma dinâmica comunitária, susceptível de estimular as indústrias culturais e criativas, razão por que essas indústrias devem dotar-se de modelos económicos inovadores e aceder a novas ofertas legais de serviços em linha. É, pois, imperativo criar um verdadeiro mercado único dos conteúdos e dos serviços em linha, adoptar medidas específicas para reforçar o papel das indústrias culturais e criativas enquanto catalisadores da inovação e da mudança estrutural, reunir os intervenientes a nível regional, nacional e europeu e criar novos produtos e serviços geradores de crescimento e empregos.
Aprovo a presente proposta, tendo em conta que o relatório conseguiu uma abordagem equilibrada para os assuntos mais importantes da organização e das actividades do Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa e para os assuntos-chave da política de segurança e defesa. O equilíbrio foi conseguido através de uma cooperação militar e civil na resolução das interacções UE-NATO.
Aprovo a presente proposta, uma vez que a amplitude das ameaças e a área total de florestas da UE exigem o aumento do financiamento das florestas através do segundo pilar da PAC, subordinado à existência de PFN e de planos de gestão operacional que integrem a estratégia de biodiversidade da UE, bem como prazos longos para projectos de silvicultura no âmbito da GFS. A elegibilidade deve ser alargada a agentes públicos e grupos de produtores, passando por uma remuneração de base territorial e incluindo medidas de conservação. Uma GFS deve ser claramente integrada, ter prioridade na investigação e na prática, bem como ter em conta a propriedade pública de 40% das florestas da UE. A preservação das espécies e as práticas de tratamento devem alargar-se a espécies microbianas e de fungos associadas.
Aprovo a presente proposta, uma vez que altera certos elementos do Regulamento (CE) n.º 1215/2009, a fim de permitir a prorrogação da sua validade até 31 de Dezembro de 2015 e realizar certos ajustamentos decorrentes da entrada em vigor dos acordos bilaterais com a Bósnia e Herzegovina e a Sérvia.
Aprovo a presente proposta, visto que a educação pré-escolar e na infância é dada de acordo com diferentes tradições em todo o continente europeu, o que torna muito complexa a criação de um sistema universal europeu no que diz respeito à educação nos primeiros anos de idade, sendo mais fácil a implementação de metas e objectivos comuns de modo a que se harmonizem as práticas de forma coerente.
Aprovo a presente resolução conjunta, salientando as medidas consideradas necessárias: utilizar todas as possibilidades e margens financeiras disponíveis no quadro do orçamento comunitário consagrado às pescas, para financiar medidas extraordinárias de apoio ao sector, para que este possa ultrapassar as dificuldades colocadas pelo aumento do preço dos combustíveis; a necessidade de o Fundo Europeu das Pescas (FEP) continuar a conceder ajudas à melhoria da selectividade das artes de pesca e à substituição de motores, por razões de segurança, protecção do ambiente e/ou economia de combustível, sobretudo para a pequena pesca costeira e artesanal de pequena escala; pelo facto de exortar a Comissão a elaborar um plano a médio e a longo prazo para melhorar a eficiência dos combustíveis no sector das pescas (incluindo a aquicultura); apela ainda à Comissão para que reforce a eficiência dos combustíveis no sector das pescas e da aquicultura, sugerindo um plano de acção adaptado às regiões costeiras e regiões insulares que apresentem um sector das pescas dinâmico.
Aprovo a principal mensagem política do relatório preliminar, que sustenta que o orçamento da UE tem um papel fundamental a desempenhar na ajuda à recuperação dos Estados-Membros da UE relativamente à crise económica e social, no sentido de se promover o crescimento e o emprego.
Aprovo a proposta do Grupo S&D, que considera que o APP tem visivelmente contribuído para excessos de captura de algumas populações de peixes, nomeadamente de polvo, e que, por conseguinte, reduziu as possibilidades de pesca dos pescadores mauritanos que exercem a pequena pesca e deu origem a vantagens competitivas injustas para a indústria da UE em virtude das taxas de acesso financiadas para embarcações da UE. Congratula-se com a proposta da Comissão Europeia de dar início a negociações para a renovação do Protocolo ao Acordo de Parceria no domínio da Pesca entre a União Europeia e a República Islâmica da Mauritânia.
Aprovo a renovação do protocolo, mas considero que ela deve atender a várias questões importantes. A avaliação efectuada concluiu que a maioria das unidades populacionais na Mauritânia estão totalmente exploradas ou sobreexploradas, pelo que a Comissão tem de analisar com a Mauritânia o desenvolvimento de planos de gestão das pescas a longo prazo, que incluam todas as concessões de pesca feitas pelas autoridades mauritanas às frotas nacionais e às frotas de países terceiros, a fim de assegurar uma exploração sustentável dos recursos haliêuticos.
Aprovo a revogação do regulamento do Conselho relativo à prova de origem de determinados produtos têxteis, pois creio que, de forma a criar um enquadramento legislativo mais claro para as empresas, são necessários esforços que visem simplificar a legislação em vigor. Não obstante, devo acrescentar que considero importante a manutenção de mecanismos alternativos de controlo das importações de tais produtos para a UE, com vista a evitar que o aumento das mesmas cause perturbações no mercado.
Aprovo esta proposta de resolução do PE, uma vez que transmite a sua insatisfação face à Comissão, na medida em que, até ao final de 2009, apenas 75 % do montante total de 21 mil milhões de euros de apoios financeiros que estavam disponíveis foi aproveitado por 50 000 pequenas e médias empresas. A excessiva burocracia administrativa que se apresenta como impedimento à maioria das pequenas e médias empresas deve deixar de existir. Há necessidade não só de simplificação, mas também de uma melhoria do sistema de acesso a este financiamento por parte das empresas.
Aprovo esta proposta, visto esta iniciativa pretender atingir os grandes objectivos da Estratégia Europa 2020 de redução da percentagem de abandono escolar precoce de 15 para 10 % e de aumentar a percentagem de pessoas com educação terciária de 31 para 40 % até 2020. A iniciativa Juventude em Movimento centra-se também na promoção da mobilidade da aprendizagem, sendo também essencial assegurar que a educação que recebem é compatível com as necessidades do mercado de trabalho para os dotar das qualificações e conhecimentos de que necessitam. A mobilidade é importante para conhecer outras culturas, mas também para se conhecer a si próprio.
Aprovo este relatório, pois analisa as necessidades das áreas urbanas, destacando, principalmente, uma incidência em duas vertentes: infra-estruturas básicas e investimentos inteligentes em infra-estruturas e serviços com base no progresso tecnológico.
Aprovo este relatório, porque a cultura pode ser um elemento crucial para as relações internacionais ao contribuir para o desenvolvimento, inclusão, democracia e prevenção de conflitos e por tal razão deve ser incluída na evolução do Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa.
Aprovo o presente relatório uma vez que teve em conta as principais preocupações expressas pelo Grupo S&D. A abordagem geral da Directiva é agora em prol da harmonização máxima, com algumas excepções significativas. É especialmente importante que a Directiva se aplique a produtos digitais, assim como (em parte) para transporte de passageiros.
Aprovo o presente relatório visto que a nova versão da proposta do artigo 51.º visa alcançar três objectivos importantes: primeiro, tornar a disposição mais compreensível e, portanto, mais fácil de usar; segundo, estabelecer novas condições que regem a aplicação do procedimento e, terceiro, clarificar o objectivo do procedimento.
Aprovo o presente relatório, congratulando a disposição que visa assegurar que o comércio entre ambas as partes se desenvolva progressivamente, dentro de um nível elevado de segurança aduaneira, e que inclui um conjunto de regras para garantir que o Acordo e o acervo da UE permaneçam em consonância com este Acordo.
Aprovo o presente relatório, considerando essencial encararmos que há falhas quer dentro, quer fora do território europeu, no que respeita ao cumprimento das legislações internacionais sociais, que constituem formas de dumping social e ambiental em detrimento dos direitos das empresas e trabalhadores europeus.
Aprovo o presente relatório, na medida em que a educação profissional e formação devem ser acessíveis, disponíveis e possíveis de acordo com os tempos de vida e o estatuto das pessoas no mercado de trabalho e o seu rendimento.
Aprovo o presente relatório, na medida em que apresenta boas prioridades políticas do Parlamento Europeu para o quadro financeiro plurianual quer em termos legislativos, quer em termos orçamentais.
Aprovo o presente relatório, pelo facto de, em primeiro lugar, criticar a Comissão pelo atraso da publicação de 9 de Fevereiro de 2011, apesar de ter tido a obrigação de o apresentar em 2010, e lamento, tal como o relator, a fraqueza da Comunicação da Comissão com vista a novos desenvolvimentos.
Aprovo o presente relatório, tendo em consideração os novos elementos que foram introduzidos pelo Conselho, nomeadamente no que se refere a earmarking, mais transparência e iniciativas para renovação das frotas, a capacidade do veículo e as possibilidades de uma mais eficiente variação de infra-estrutura. A Eurovinheta III irá permitir aos Estados-Membros - se optarem por tal - taxar os usuários rodoviários pelos custos externos (poluição, ar, barulho) de modo a que os poluidores-pagadores sejam introduzidos nos transportes rodoviários.
Aprovo o presente relatório, tendo em conta os resultados positivos das avaliações de ambos os países de modo a verificar se cumprem os requisitos do Acervo de Schengen.
Aprovo o presente relatório, tendo em conta que o Acordo de Parceria actual de Pesca entre a Comunidade Europeia e São Tomé está em vigor desde 2006 e que o Protocolo para este Acordo terminou em 31 de Maio de 2011.
Aprovo o presente relatório, uma vez que apela à necessidade de se tomarem decisões concretas para a futura política de coesão sobre algumas questões-chave, como é o fortalecimento do Objectivo 3. Neste domínio, é importante não deixar de fora as regiões mais isoladas e ultraperiféricas.
Aprovo o presente relatório, uma vez que inclui uma série de preocupações do Grupo S&D ao reconhecer as limitações do PIB e a necessidade de se incluírem indicadores adicionais para medir o progresso económico e social a médio e a longo prazo.
Aprovo também as indicações do relatório no sentido de se procurar reforçar o papel da UE nas organizações multilaterais de segurança, no G-8, no G-20, entre outras.
Aprovámos hoje no Parlamento Europeu o relatório sobre o potencial do sector criativo.
Após a adesão da Bulgária e da Roménia à União Europeia, as zonas marítimas dos dois países passaram a fazer parte das águas pan-europeias, sendo os regulamentos directamente aplicáveis nas suas legislações nacionais.
Após a análise das contribuições que recebemos de todas as partes interessadas sobre este tema, e no seguimento da consulta pública às partes interessadas, estamos prestes a apresentar recomendações sobre a melhor maneira de reforçar e apoiar as indústrias culturais e criativas, a fim de desenvolver e produzir os resultados que delas esperamos.
Após a catástrofe de Fukoshima, muitos europeus estão agora, uma vez mais, preocupados com a energia nuclear. É, por conseguinte, extremamente importante que o controlo e a avaliação dos reactores europeus não se tornem um tigre de papel, mas que sejam uma avaliação realmente adequada.
Após a catástrofe de Fukushima esta questão adquiriu acutilância inusitada pelas questões de segurança que lhe são imanentes.
Após a ratificação do Tratado de Lisboa, os poderes do Parlamento Europeu encontram-se reforçados e este último é, assim, co-legislador em quase todos os domínios ao abrigo do processo legislativo ordinário, o que suscita a atenção de um número ainda maior de representantes de interesses que, de resto, exercem uma função essencial no diálogo aberto e pluralista em que qualquer sistema democrático assenta e constituem, para os deputados do Parlamento, uma fonte de informação importante no quadro do exercício dos seus mandatos. À luz destes desenvolvimentos e deste contexto constitucional, e de acordo com o seu compromisso a favor da transparência, o Parlamento Europeu e a Comissão acordaram em estabelecer um registo comum para a inscrição e o controlo das organizações e das pessoas que participam na elaboração e na implementação das políticas da União Europeia. O estabelecimento e a manutenção de um registo apoiam-se sobre os sistemas existentes, criados e lançados pelo Parlamento Europeu, em 1996, e a Comissão Europeia, em Junho de 2008, completados pelos trabalhos do grupo de trabalho conjunto Parlamento Europeu-Comissão, assim como pelas adaptações que decorrem da experiência adquirida e os contributos dados pelas partes interessadas. O trabalho em prol da transparência tem de continuar.
Após a ratificação do Tratado de Lisboa, os poderes do Parlamento Europeu encontram-se reforçados e este último é, assim, co-legislador em quase todos os domínios ao abrigo do processo legislativo ordinário, o que suscita a atenção de um número ainda maior de representantes de interesses que, de resto, exercem uma função essencial no diálogo aberto e pluralista em que qualquer sistema democrático assenta e constituem, para os deputados do Parlamento, uma fonte de informação importante no quadro do exercício dos seus mandatos. É, no entanto, imprescindível criar mecanismos de registo e de controlo.
Após a ratificação do Tratado de Lisboa, os poderes do Parlamento foram reforçadas, e este é hoje co-legislador em quase todos os domínios no âmbito do procedimento legislativo ordinário.
Após as necessárias avaliações dos peritos, e apesar de ainda existirem alguns problemas por resolver, ambos os países mostraram estar preparados para aplicar as disposições do acervo de Schengen e podem, portanto, efectuar a sua plena adesão ao mesmo.
Após cerca de um ano de trabalhos, a Comissão Especial sobre os Desafios Políticos e os Recursos Orçamentais apresentou finalmente as futuras decisões que determinam as prioridades em termos de despesas para uma utilização eficiente e eficaz das dotações da União Europeia, conducente à aplicação de políticas orientadas para os resultados.
Após dezanove meses de crise institucional no país, precisamente no dia em que quase 8 milhões de malgaxes tinham sido chamados a votar sobre a revisão da Constituição, em Novembro de 2010, diluiu-se toda a esperança de construir uma verdadeira democracia nesta ex-colónia europeia.
Após longas negociações, finalmente conseguimos convencer os nossos parceiros das Nações Unidas a conceder à UE um novo estatuto na Organização. Trata-se definitivamente de um sucesso, sobretudo tendo em conta a resistência inicial da Assembleia-geral.
Após o Tratado de Lisboa, nós tínhamos grandes esperanças. No entanto, se o Conselho não estiver à altura da tarefa, quando o egoísmo nacional e as estratégias pessoais prevalecem na tomada de decisões, a Europa e os ideais europeus terão perdido mais uma batalha.
Após o acidente de Fukushima no Japão, a UE tem de se munir de normas ambiciosas e tratados-quadro para regular os assuntos relacionados com a energia nuclear e a política energética.
Após os resultados positivos das avaliações e das visitas de acompanhamento efectuadas por equipas de peritos, é possível concluir que embora ainda haja algumas questões pendentes e se venham a exigir relatórios regulares e um acompanhamento no futuro, estes não constituem um entrave à plena adesão da Bulgária e da Roménia ao espaço Schengen. Não podemos, no entanto, descurar a região Bulgária-Turquia-Grécia que é uma das mais sensíveis das fronteiras externas da UE em termos de imigração ilegal. É necessário reforçar as medidas já tomadas e estarmos preparados para lidar com um possível aumento acentuado da pressão migratória, e a Bulgária deverá adoptar medidas adicionais, incluindo um plano especial que inclua medidas a aplicar no momento da entrada para o espaço Schengen.
Após quatro anos de vigência do Regulamento (CE) n.º 1905/2006, é tempo de fazer um balanço e aprender com eventuais erros e/ou lacunas existentes, uma vez que a Comissão pretende apresentar, antes do Verão, as suas propostas relativas ao quadro financeiro plurianual (QFP) para o período pós-2013.
Após semanas de negociações, foi finalmente alcançado um acordo sobre esta questão crucial para os cidadãos europeus, ou seja, os direitos dos consumidores.
Após uma análise atenta, o comité da UE responsável pela avaliação reconheceu que estes países cumpriram todos os critérios de adesão ao espaço Schengen: proporcionam garantias suficientes no que respeita à protecção das fronteiras nacionais terrestres, marítimas e aéreas e dominam o Sistema de Informação Schengen, o que lhes permite trocar dados e assegurar de forma fiável a protecção dessas informações. O meu grupo considera que a introdução de novos critérios de adesão neste momento seria errada porque significaria a aplicação de dois pesos e duas medidas a estes países.
Após uma enorme vaga de despedimentos na empresa General Motors Belgium e em quatro dos seus fornecedores que operam no sector automóvel, a Bélgica apresentou, em 20 de Dezembro de 2010, uma candidatura de mobilização do Fundo Europeu de Ajustamento à Globalização para apoio à requalificação profissional dos 2 834 trabalhadores despedidos.
Após vários relatórios e debates aprofundados, o Parlamento lançou o seu registo para os representantes de interesses em 1996.
Aquando da votação em primeira leitura, em 2010, o Parlamento aprovou alterações às regras relativas à marcação de origem, indicação de materiais derivados de animais, utilização de símbolos independentes da língua e uma cláusula de revisão, mas o Conselho não aceitou tudo. É importante que aceite agora as várias propostas, designadamente sobre marcação de origem.
Aquele Estado da Europa Central é uma rota de trânsito de drogas ilícitas, que são contrabandeadas no caminho dos países de produção para os países consumidores. Têm-se registado apreensões em grande escala de cocaína, na Croácia, na sua maioria, relacionadas com os transportes marítimos.
Aquele buraco infernal tem de ser fechado imediatamente e todos os actuais detidos deverão ter acesso a um julgamento justo perante um tribunal civil, todas as prisões secretas em que a CIA pratica tortura, na Europa, têm de ser fechadas, a utilização pela CIA do aeroporto de Shanon, na Irlanda, para voos militares de entrega tem de terminar, e tem de se pôr fim à barbaridade que é a pena de morte.
Aqueles com quem temos estado a trabalhar diariamente sabem que estamos a trabalhar com eles e com o Conselho, desde o primeiro dia, para conseguirmos um sistema comum europeu de asilo. É um trabalho árduo, difícil e moroso, mas estamos a fazer alguns progressos.
Aqueles que apenas leiam por alto os formulários e os assinam sem ponderar e sem exame minucioso podem ser desagradavelmente surpreendidos com elevados custos em que incorrem.
Aqueles que hoje levantam argumentos artificiais contra a adesão da Bulgária e da Roménia ao espaço Schengen terão de viver com o peso na consciência da responsabilidade pela destruição do projecto político que é a União Europeia, e nunca mais poderão escapar a essa responsabilidade.
Aqueles que questionam este texto foram por vezes acusados de o fazerem por motivos puramente políticos.
Aqueles que tecem estas críticas estão certos, mas aqueles que solicitam uma redução dos fundos consagrados à política agrícola comum estão errados. A política agrícola comum não é só uma política para a agricultura; ela é um instrumento para redistribuir os recursos das cidades da Europa pelas zonas rurais. São os cidadãos europeus das zonas rurais que cuidam das nossas florestas, dos nossos rios e lagos e que nos dão alimentos, ar puro e água limpa.
Aqui estamos e estaremos para a apoiar e animar, certos de que é nela que germinará a mudança e se afirmará a alternativa cada vez mais necessária e urgente nesta Europa.
Aqui reside o problema de toda a comunicação, porque, se isto significa que a Comissão está a propor uma possibilidade adicional de reintrodução de controlos fronteiriços, não prevista no actual acervo de Schengen, posso desde já afirmar que o nosso grupo irá usar de todos os meios ao seu dispor para lutar contra uma tal proposta, posição que - espero - todo o Parlamento adopte.
Aqui também, Senhor Comissário Siim Kallas, caberá à Comissão um papel fundamental.
Aqui, tenho de referir o compromisso assumido pelos líderes europeus de concretizar os Objectivos de Desenvolvimento do Milénio. A erradicação da pobreza a nível mundial integra agora as prioridades da União em matéria de política externa.
Aquilo de que necessitamos urgentemente é de uma estratégia a longo prazo que defina claramente as medidas e as acções que devemos adoptar para consolidarmos o nosso lugar na cena mundial.
Aquilo que está aqui em causa é a excelência, mas a excelência tem de assentar nos seus próprios pés em vez de ser simplesmente uma inteligência flutuante. A excelência tem de criar raízes nas regiões e nas cidades. Não se pode deixar que este elevado valor acrescentado se encontre somente nas regiões metropolitanas.
Aquilo que noto em muitos discursos de líderes, tanto daqueles que estão em países em dificuldades como daqueles países que são países pagadores e contribuintes, é um discurso irresponsável que, muitas vezes, até faz apelo a algumas características das nacionalidades que são extremamente negativas.
Aquilo que o Senhor Comissário Günther Oettinger conquistou ao longo dos últimos meses é um exemplo para todos nós. Não estou a tentar afirmar que tudo corresponde exactamente ao que pretendíamos. Só no final poderemos dizer se obtivemos o que pretendíamos.
Argumenta-se sempre que o objectivo é o crescimento e o emprego, mas, como esquecem as políticas de solidariedade e coesão económica e social, apostando apenas nas políticas monetaristas e neoliberais que interessam aos grupos económicos e financeiros para lhes garantir mais lucros, o que teremos, como as experiências da Grécia, da Irlanda e de Portugal já demonstram, é mais desigualdades sociais, mais desemprego e mais pobreza.
Armados com a informação útil relevante e comparável, devíamos ter, num próximo futuro, mais capacidade para proporcionarmos à UE um valor acrescentado em questões relacionadas com a silvicultura, socioeconómicas e ambientais, aplanando, por conseguinte, o caminho para um melhor contributo da UE para ajudar as florestas a continuarem a proporcionar-nos os seus múltiplos benefícios a todos nós. A Comissão irá agora estudar este relatório em pormenor e reflectir aprofundadamente sobre a nossa reacção a ele e às conclusões do Conselho, bem como ao contributo das partes interessadas.
Arrogante imperialismo! Por outro lado, não convida a Rússia a pôr imediatamente termo ao funcionamento de reactores nucleares do tipo de Chernobyl, que constituem uma ameaça para todos nós. Voto contra esta resolução, não obstante ela exigir o respeito dos direitos democráticos dos cidadãos russos, coisa que apoio.
As AI indicam à autoridade legislativa as eventuais consequências das suas opções e ajudam a tomar uma decisão. Por conseguinte, podem ser um importante contributo para legislar melhor.
As AI servem apenas para auxiliar na preparação do conteúdo específico de uma decisão política. O projecto de relatório está dividido em quatro secções. Começa por descrever requisitos gerais para avaliações de impacto a nível europeu.
As ANC procedem à notação de três sectores diferentes - o sector público, as empresas e os instrumentos financeiros estruturados - e desempenharam um papel significativo no caminho que levou à crise financeira, atribuindo notações incorrectas a instrumentos financeiros estruturados que tiveram de ser descidas, em média, três a quatro níveis durante a crise. O Regulamento (CE) n.º 1060/2009 representou a primeira reacção à crise financeira e já aborda as questões mais prementes, submetendo as ANC a supervisão e regulamentação. No entanto, espero que as ANC sejam obrigadas a mais transparência na sua actuação. O facto de não haver certezas sobre a regulamentação aplicável neste sector está a pôr em risco o bom funcionamento dos mercados financeiros da UE, pelo que é necessário que a Comissão, antes da apresentação de novas alterações ao Regulamento n.º 1060/2009, identifique correctamente as lacunas do novo quadro e forneça uma avaliação de impacto para o conjunto de alternativas disponíveis para preencher esta lacuna, incluindo a possibilidade de novas propostas legislativas. A indústria da notação de crédito tem vários problemas, sendo alguns dos mais importantes a falta de concorrência, as estruturas de oligopólio e a falta de responsabilização e transparência.
As Constituições dos Estados-Membros têm de respeitar os valores europeus, incluindo o nosso valor comunitário que definimos.
As Instituições devem oferecer aos cidadãos e às associações representativas a possibilidade de expressarem e partilharem publicamente os seus pontos de vista em todos os domínios da acção da União. Em particular, as Instituições devem manter um diálogo aberto, transparente e regular com as associações representativas e a sociedade civil.
As Nações Unidas aguardaram muito tempo até denunciarem a situação deste país. Pior ainda, o Governo do Sri Lanka multiplicou as suas maquinações para impedir a publicação do último relatório, em particular, e para que as suas conclusões fossem rejeitadas. Só podemos saudar o relatório de 11 de Abril. A resolução hoje apresentada representa uma direcção adequada.
As Nações Unidas referiram que o seu Secretário-Geral está a analisar cuidadosamente os relatórios, as conclusões e as recomendações, e que a Alta Comissária das Nações Unidas para os Direitos Humanos instou o Governo do Sri Lanka a aplicar prontamente as medidas propostas pelo painel e a garantir a justiça.
As PME continuam a esbarrar com graves dificuldades para expandirem as suas actividades e, por vezes, até mesmo para sobreviverem. É, portanto, necessário reduzir a burocracia através do reforço do controlo e de uma regulamentação inteligente.
As PME debatem-se com dificuldades na obtenção de acesso ao financiamento e ao mercado. O futuro QFP deve prever medidas que permitam superar estas dificuldades. É necessário um apoio acrescido aos programas e instrumentos financeiros que já estão a funcionar bem, mas que se revelaram inadequados, como o programa de competitividade e inovação. Cumpre melhorar o acesso ao apoio financeiro prestado a empresas novas e inovadoras sob a forma de capital de arranque.
As PME debatem-se com sérios problemas em expandir as suas actividades, melhorar a sua capacidade de inovação e aceder aos mercados.
As PME precisam de menos burocracia, de um acesso mais fácil ao financiamento e a mercados e competências "verdes" que correspondam às necessidades da economia real.
As PME representam cerca de 99 % do total das empresas da UE, contribuindo em termos fundamentais para o crescimento económico: além de fonte de emprego e de riqueza, assumem-se como veículos particularmente aptos para a inovação. Assim sendo, é essencial continuar a oferecer-lhes condições para que se possam desenvolver e afirmar no mercado, garantindo-lhes acesso ao financiamento e às potencialidades do mercado único.
As PME também podem ser apoiadas por meio de medidas de incentivo fiscal de âmbito nacional, em especial nos primeiros meses de actividade.
As actuais condições ambientais são responsáveis pela alteração das florestas europeias. É previsível que, a longo prazo, a faia desapareça por completo na região do Mediterrâneo e que a floresta de coníferas venha a diminuir em termos de área em toda a Europa continental.
As actuais rubricas orçamentais em vigor para este projecto são mais do que suficientes para possibilitar a sua conclusão e, no entanto - como seria de esperar -, a proposta é gastar ainda mais.
As actuais taxas de juro punitivas a que a Grécia está sujeita estão, de facto, a impedir a sua economia privada de realizar quaisquer investimentos, sejam eles em processos de produção ou em imóveis. A Grécia está a tornar-se um país do terceiro mundo, deitando por terra todas as esperanças de reembolso.
As acções realizadas até aqui com o fim de desenvolver o conhecimento nos domínios mais variados demonstram a necessidade cada vez mais premente de uma mobilização no sentido da difusão das inovações e da sua aplicação no nosso quotidiano.
As agro-indústrias mais pequenas incorrem frequentemente em custos elevados quando têm de cumprir normas de saúde e ambientais.
As agências costumam apresentar os resultados das avaliações externas no seu relatório anual de actividades, o qual, por sua vez, é apresentado à autoridade orçamental.
As agências de notação de crédito (ANC) cumprem diversos objectivos úteis, nomeadamente compilam informação sobre a qualidade do crédito dos emitentes num ambiente global.
As agências de notação de crédito são intermediários de informação que, ao reduzir as assimetrias de informação nos mercados de capitais e ao facilitar o acesso ao mercado global, através da redução de custos de informação e do aproveitamento do potencial dos credores e dos investidores, promovem a liquidez e a transparência nos mercados.
As agências de notação de crédito são úteis: fornecem informação sobre a qualidade dos produtos de crédito, permitindo aos emitentes de dívida e aos investidores acederem aos mercados global e doméstico e, em última instância, ajudando a fixar os preços. No entanto, a crise realçou os perigos criados pelo sistema actual: a falta de concorrência e, sobretudo, a falta de responsabilização e transparência das agências.
As agências de notação de risco de crédito cumprem diversos objectivos úteis, elaborando informação sobre a qualidade do crédito dos emitentes, permitindo aos emitentes acederem aos mercados global e doméstico, reduzindo os custos da informação e alargando o número de potenciais investidores, fazendo com que os mercados se tornem mais líquidos.
As agências de notação estavam a receber honorários de instituições financeiras por notar os produtos dessas mesmas instituições e pelas resultantes vendas desses produtos.
As agências pouco eficientes têm de ser encerradas, porque os contribuintes decididamente não irão compreender por que razão estão a ser desperdiçados milhões de euros em concursos de fotografias no âmbito desta profusão de agências.
As alterações adoptadas pela Comissão do Comércio Internacional são, na minha perspectiva, um passo na direcção certa.
As alterações agora introduzidas no enquadramento regulamentar permitem melhorar as medidas de política comercial, sobretudo após o aumento de importações com origem na República Popular da China, introduzindo instrumentos de controlo para as importações de produtos têxteis provenientes de países terceiros.
As alterações apresentadas não incidem sobre o conteúdo em si, são apenas alterações formais exigidas pelo próprio processo de codificação, apresentadas em 22 línguas oficiais.
As alterações climáticas estão a ameaçar as florestas europeias, com um aumento dos incêndios florestais, com doenças que se transmitem de um país para outro, pondo em perigo espécies inteiras, e com catástrofes causadas por condições atmosféricas extremas. O impacto difere de zona geográfica para zona geográfica, mas é um impacto transfronteiriço, que necessita de ser abordado com ajuda europeia.
As alterações climáticas, os transportes sustentáveis, a natureza, a biodiversidade, a utilização e exploração das matérias-primas e dos recursos naturais, bem como a gestão dos resíduos, têm visto aumentar de forma exponencial a sua importância nas políticas dos Estados-Membros.
As alterações introduzidas na política agrícola comum não serão, por conseguinte, meramente qualitativas - melhorando o direccionamento dos nossos objectivos -, mas visarão também distribuir os pagamentos entre os Estados-Membros - quer dentro dos próprios Estados-Membros, quer entre as várias categorias de explorações agrícolas -, precisamente a fim de melhor utilizar os recursos disponíveis em termos dos objectivos que foram estabelecidos.
As alterações propostas para reforçar o mecanismo de monitorização, para manter a confiança mútua entre Estados-Membros e a sua capacidade de aplicar eficaz e eficientemente as medidas de acompanhamento, tornarão possível a manutenção de um espaço sem fronteiras.
As alterações reintroduzidas pelo relator abrangem as questões da identificação da origem dos materiais, das partes não têxteis de origem animal, uma cláusula de revisão, um pedido de estudo sobre substâncias perigosas, os símbolos independentes de linguagem ou códigos para as fibras, os requisitos para o processo técnico ser anexado ao pedido de autorização do nome das fibras têxteis, produtos têxteis multifibras, os alfaiates não assalariados, os laboratórios responsáveis por testar misturas têxteis e a indicação obrigatória da composição das fibras de feltros e chapéus de feltro.
As análises da Comissão publicadas em Maio do ano passado confirmaram que a atribuição de licenças a título gratuito constitui um meio eficaz para enfrentar o risco potencial de fuga de carbono.
As aplicações e serviços do GNSS no domínio dos transportes têm implicações variadas na segurança, na eficácia, nos custos económicos e ambientais de todos os modos de transportes.
As apreensões de cocaína, significativas e em grande escala, estão principalmente relacionadas com os transportes marítimos. O consumo e o contrabando de drogas ilegais são fenómenos globais que ameaçam a saúde e a estabilidade social.
As autoridades britânicas responderam afirmando que o caso de Sellafield é uma excepção porque não se produz energia nessas instalações. Tal não serve de grande conforto para os cidadãos na Irlanda, que muito sofrerão em caso de acidente. A central de Sellafield está muito perto da Irlanda e tem sido palco de vários acidentes até à data, pelo que solicito à Comissão que exerça pressão sobre as autoridades britânicas para realizarem o teste de stress às instalações pois a verdade é que continua a ser um risco para o povo da Irlanda.
As autoridades búlgaras enviaram toda a documentação necessária aos seus homólogos romenos, atestando que o navio se encontra inscrito no registo da União Europeia e está na posse de todas as licenças para pescar nas águas do Mar Negro. Não obstante, não houve qualquer progresso por parte da Roménia. A única resposta foi que apenas a legislação romena e a Constituição do país são aplicáveis.
As autoridades do Azerbaijão aparentemente não entenderam a necessidade de manterem um diálogo com a sociedade civil, e de não exercerem pressão sobre a sociedade.
As autoridades europeias têm, por isso mesmo, de actuar em duas frentes. A curto prazo, é necessário garantir a implementação de um mecanismo de compensação para os agricultores europeus mais afectados e, a médio prazo, será necessário reformar o sistema de alerta precoce no que respeita a alimentos perigosos a fim de evitar novos alertas infundados no futuro.
As autoridades europeias, nacionais e regionais abdicam dos seus poderes quando aceitam a mobilização de fundos públicos para atenuar as consequências do encerramento de uma fábrica.
As autoridades gregas competentes informaram-me da eleição do senhor deputado Dimitrios Droutsas para substituir o senhor deputado Lambrinidis.
As autoridades locais, com o apoio do governo nacional, devem assumir a responsabilidade por estes incidentes.
As avaliações de impacto (AI) são muito importantes no processo legislativo e devem ser incentivadas no futuro. Há grandes vantagens nas AI. Estas alertam a autoridade legislativa para as consequências das suas opções e contribuem para uma melhor e mais consciente tomada de decisão. São, assim, um importante contributo para uma legislação de excelência.
As avaliações de impacto (AI) são um instrumento central do processo legislativo, na medida em que dão conta das eventuais consequências da aplicação de determinada legislação e ajudam, por isso mesmo, a tomar uma decisão. A independência e a transparência são valores que devem ser preservados e incentivados em qualquer democracia, na medida em que dão aos cidadãos garantias de objectividade na avaliação, de proporcionalidade na decisão e de legalidade no procedimento. É por esta razão que concordo, em termos gerais, com as propostas do Parlamento contidas no presente relatório.
As avaliações de impacto apresentam uma avaliação sistemática dos efeitos prováveis da acção legislativa, ao nível da saúde, direitos fundamentais, social, económico, ecológico, etc., contribuindo para reduzir a burocracia e assegurar a coerência das políticas da UE. Apoio esta iniciativa que reconhece às avaliações de impacto um papel fundamental de auxílio ao processo de tomada de decisão, as quais devem ser caracterizadas por uma total independência, transparência, seguir uma metodologia clara, proceder a uma análise fundamentada e objectiva dos efeitos potenciais e sempre acompanhada por uma análise de custo-benefício.
As avaliações de impacto devem enumerar as possibilidades e fornecer recomendações aos legisladores, mas devem igualmente estar preparadas para recomendar que não se tomem medidas, quando se concluir ser esta a via mais adequada. A legislação europeia tem um enorme impacto nos cidadãos que vivem dentro das suas fronteiras, e temos de aproveitar todas as oportunidades para garantir que essa legislação é tão justa e equilibrada quanto é possível.
As avaliações de impacto devem resumir-se a um apoio na tomada de decisões estratégicas e nunca devem substituir as decisões estratégicas no processo democrático de tomada de decisões.
As avaliações de impacto levadas a cabo na União Europeia são do interesse de todos os cidadãos europeus, na medida em que contribuem para melhorar a qualidade legislativa através de uma análise independente dos efeitos das potenciais e eventuais medidas tomadas a nível europeu. A relatora evidencia a necessidade de avaliar melhor e de forma mais eficiente as consequências económicas, sociais, ambientais e de saúde pública das opções políticas da União. As avaliações de impacto desempenham um papel-chave em todo o ciclo de desenvolvimento de uma política, sendo igualmente uma condição para ter normas de qualidade e uma transposição e aplicação correctas das normas.
As avaliações de impacto podem ser um auxílio importante do ponto de vista de uma legislação melhor se forem estudadas durante a totalidade do ciclo político todas as consequências económicas, sociais, ambientais e de saúde das opções políticas que se pretendem tomar, assim como o seu impacto sobre os direitos fundamentais dos cidadãos.
As avaliações de impacto são instrumentos importantes para o aumento da qualidade dos processos legislativos (propostas políticas, por exemplo). No entanto, as avaliações de impacto precisam de alguns ajustes: é especialmente necessário criar um mecanismo independente, uma vez que as avaliações de impacto propostas pela Comissão não apresentam um nível de qualidade uniforme e frequentemente servem antes para justificar uma proposta legislativa, não para permitir uma ponderação objectiva dos factos.
As avaliações de impacto são muito importantes para o nosso trabalho no Parlamento e deveriam desempenhar um papel de maior destaque, pelo que apoio este relatório.
As avaliações de impacto são um instrumento central do processo legislativo de que a autoridade legislativa europeia se deve servir mais intensivamente no futuro, uma vez que indicam à autoridade legislativa as eventuais consequências das suas opções. Importa não esquecer, contudo, que servem exclusivamente para a preparação de uma decisão política do ponto de vista técnico.
As avaliações de impacto são um instrumento central para legislar melhor e têm como objectivo a melhoria e a simplificação da futura e da actual legislação. Na realidade, as avaliações de impacto são um instrumento adequado para aferir o impacto da promulgação de novas leis e a simplificação e reformulação das leis em vigor.
As avaliações de impacto são um instrumento legislativo útil, possibilitam uma preparação de decisões estratégicas com base no conhecimento, contribuindo assim para uma melhor legislação. A transparência, um nível uniforme de qualidade e a apresentação das vantagens e desvantagens de um número suficiente de opções estratégicas constituem a essência de avaliações de impacto fidedignas.
As avaliações de impacto têm um efeito significativo nas actividades legislativas, razão pela qual são necessários novos desenvolvimentos, com o estabelecimento de um mecanismo independente dessas análises.
As avaliações e as visitas adicionais de equipas de peritos demonstraram que a Bulgária e a Roménia estão preparadas para participar integralmente no espaço Schengen.
As avaliações realizadas mostram que tanto a Roménia como a Bulgária demonstraram estar suficientemente preparadas para aplicar todas as disposições do acervo de Schengen de forma satisfatória.
As causas da crise não estão a ser combatidas. O problema é esse. Não temos coragem para aprofundar a democracia e aumentar a transparência, e para diminuir a actividade política prosseguida à porta fechada. E isso põe em risco o ideal europeu e abre caminho ao nacionalismo tacanho.
As cidades da Europa são os seus centros de actividade económica, inovação e emprego, mas enfrentam diversos desafios. A tendência para a suburbanização, a concentração das carências e do desemprego em bairros urbanos, o aumento do congestionamento e outros problemas de complexidade semelhante exigem soluções nos domínios dos transportes e da habitação, bem como nos regimes de formação e emprego, que têm de ser concebidos à medida das necessidades locais.
As cidades e toda a sua infra-estrutura são construídas por pessoas. São as pessoas que as habitam e fazem funcionar os seus serviços públicos na educação, na saúde e nos transportes, o comércio e indústria e as suas actividades culturais. São elas que devem estar no centro de qualquer política urbana.
As cidades são o fulcro da vida social e económica e possuem uma capacidade essencial de integração social, uma vez que, por um lado, garantem a preservação da diversidade cultural e, por outro lado, mantêm uma ligação permanente entre o centro e as áreas periféricas.
As cinco orientações da análise para reduzir a pressão sobre as PME incluem a simplificação das regras em matéria de IVA, bem como a redução das taxas, e uma directiva relativa aos atrasos de pagamento, mas isso são apenas remendos nas normas e regulamentos existentes. O primeiro princípio da análise - a criação de um ambiente propício - não devia significar propor novas regras como sociedades privadas europeias e auxílios estatais.
As comissões conjuntas tornam-se assim, para efeitos deste processo, "comissão competente" na acepção do Regimento.
As companhias de aviação também vão colher os benefícios do Acordo, na medida em que este prevê a utilização das unidades de reparação e manutenção das duas partes uma pela outra. O Acordo vai não só tornar os mercados canadiano e europeu mais competitivos como vai também reforçar a segurança global.
As competências em TIC estão dependentes do aperfeiçoamento da qualidade da formação, do apoio à aprendizagem ao longo da vida, e da criação de oportunidades para que as pessoas que já estão empregadas possam actualizar continuamente os seus conhecimentos e competências.
As compras por vias tradicionais também beneficiarão de maior protecção: todos os consumidores europeus terão direito a um prazo de resolução de catorze dias, que poderá ser estendido se os consumidores não tiverem recebido determinadas informações essenciais.
As conclusões aprovadas pelo Conselho "Justiça e Assuntos Internos", em 11 e 12 de Abril de 2011, e a comunicação emitida pela Comissão a semana passada são passos importantes nesse sentido. A Presidência convocou uma reunião extraordinária do Conselho "Justiça e Assuntos Internos" para 12 de Maio, a fim de debater a questão da gestão dos fluxos migratórios e de refugiados.
As conclusões dos dados obtidos em 10 Estados-Membros serão publicadas assim que possível.
As condições fundamentais para alcançar os objectivos gerais da política de coesão são uma disciplina financeira rigorosa e a transparência na atribuição de fundos.
As condições que se aplicam à política ambiental são as mesmas que se aplicam à política económica, de redistribuição, de desenvolvimento e da indústria. Não podemos tomar decisões delicadas e proceder às mudanças e adaptações necessárias na sociedade se não tivermos acesso aos factos.
As consequências a nível internacional que, como comunidade internacional, temos de suportar de modo algum se limitam ao território da antiga União Soviética, Bielorrússia, Ucrânia e Rússia, porque mais de metade da precipitação radioactiva que se seguiu ao incêndio e à explosão caiu no território do continente europeu.
As consequências actuais da ambivalência da comunidade internacional para com o Sri Lanka são evidentes: perda de influência e incapacidade de determinar a evolução dos acontecimentos.
As consequências do despenhamento de uma aeronave numa central nuclear incluem-se especificamente entre os critérios do teste, motivo pelo qual fazem parte integrante da terceira fase da investigação. Terei muito gosto em lhe mostrar.
As consequências específicas para as pequenas e médias empresas devem ser tidas em conta quando pertinente e estas empresas devem ser permanentemente informadas da evolução do processo legislativo. A principal exigência do Parlamento é a criação de uma estrutura autónoma para a realização de avaliações de impacto no seio do Parlamento, com vista a reforçar a qualidade da sua legislação e a gerar sinergias, com a possibilidade de criação de um mecanismo comum para todas as instituições europeias.
As consequências são bem conhecidas: domínio de mercados para uns, destruição dos sistemas produtivos mais débeis e pretextos acrescidos para ataques a direitos e condições de vida e de trabalho.
As consequências são também bem conhecidas: domínio de mercados para uns, afectação de sistemas produtivos mais débeis e pretextos acrescidos para ataques a direitos e condições de vida e de trabalho.
As consultas aos consumidores que o Senhor Comissário se comprometeu a fazer constituirão um passo fundamental, não só para o sector dos têxteis mas também para todos os sectores relativamente aos quais o Parlamento tem frequentemente questionado o desejo por parte do público em geral de ser informado acerca do local de origem.
As consultas regulares entre os embaixadores dos Estados-Membros e os embaixadores da EU serão um passo importante neste caminho. A União deve, enquanto tal, contribuir para melhorar a eficiência e a transparência das Nações Unidas e reforçar a boa gestão dos seus recursos financeiros. A criação de uma Assembleia Parlamentar das Nações Unidas no âmbito do sistema das Nações Unidas é uma proposta interessante que merece estudo e debate.
As consultas sobre a proposta horizontal relativa ao país de origem na política comercial ainda não terminou, pelo que não nos parece apropriado criar um precedente que poria em risco a proposta e prejudicaria o resultado desse debate.
As contas convencionais, ao não fornecerem dados sobre os custos privados e sociais da utilização de recursos naturais e sobre os prejuízos para o ambiente, podem enviar aos decisores uma mensagem errada de progresso, o que pode colocar a sociedade no caminho de um crescimento insustentável.
As contas do ambiente visam unicamente explicitar as interacções existentes. O desenvolvimento sustentável na UE exige a adopção de uma conduta razoável no que respeita ao ecossistema e ao agravamento da escassez de recursos.
As contas económicas do ambiente devem contribuir para a avaliação das políticas, disponibilizando, em particular, dados sobre o impacto ambiental das actividades económicas.
As contas nacionais têm, portanto, de incluir uma declaração económica e ambiental integrada com dados plenamente coerentes.
As contribuições dos Estados-Membros constituem um quadragésimo da sua despesa nacional.
As convenções internacionais, de que o Sri Lanka é signatário, exigem investigações às alegadas violações e o julgamento dos responsáveis. Só a justiça e uma investigação transparente e honesta permitirão que os cidadãos do Sri Lanka sanem as mazelas de um conflito longo e difícil e continuem a sua vida em paz.
As crianças na primeira infância têm uma especial curiosidade, vontade de aprender e capacidade de absorção, sendo nesse período que se moldam as competências linguísticas e de expressão. É também nesta idade que se criam as bases para o futuro percurso escolar e profissional, bem como para o desenvolvimento das suas competências sociais.
As crises económicas, financeiras e alimentares, as alterações climáticas e os conflitos fizeram-nos ter consciência de que precisamos de criar uma forma de governação global ou aquilo a que Jacques Attali chama "Estado mundial". A Europa tem, naturalmente, um papel a desempenhar neste novo espaço político de dimensão planetária como uma potência mundial e branda, assente em normas, regras e exemplos.
As culturas aspiram a enriquecer-se reciprocamente num espírito de respeito mútuo. São uma inesgotável fonte de energia renovável. A maior parte das vezes, a criação cultural descreve ou exprime uma visão, um compromisso ou uma tomada de posição que pode ser pertinente ou não. É o exercício de um direito, incluindo o direito de denunciar.
As culturas indígenas serão deslocadas e perder-se-ão. Os relatórios falam de liberdade de expressão, mas só são convincentes quando expressam a sua intolerância para com aqueles de quem discordam.
As declarações desencontradas que todos os dias são feitas por políticos nacionais e partes interessadas apenas criam mais confusão e aumentam a especulação nos mercados. O risco de uma contaminação progressiva de todos os EstadosMembros é real.
As declarações pias, de boas intenções, sobre defesa do emprego e dos direitos laborais e sociais, são profundamente contraditórias à defesa da manutenção do Pacto de Estabilidade (a que já chamaram estúpido), incluindo o reforço das sanções contra os países com economias mais vulneráveis, vítimas das políticas neoliberais, e o Pacto para o Euro Mais.
As deficiências nunca deveriam conduzir automaticamente à reintrodução do controlo das fronteiras.
As deportações de 1941 infligiram um golpe devastador à sociedade civil democrática.
As diferenças na redacção das propostas não teriam um impacto substantivo no âmbito ou na intensidade da supervisão económica a levar a cabo.
As dificuldades envolvidas na detecção de actividades desta natureza minam o próprio funcionamento do Mercado Interno.
As dimensões culturais das acções externas da UE não devem ser sobrestimadas, e é importante que a Comissária Ashton continue a integrar esse princípio no seu trabalho com o SEAE.
As directivas dizem respeito às emissões dos tractores agrícolas e dos motores de máquinas móveis não rodoviárias.
As disposições deste regulamento protegem os consumidores que procuram recorrer de empresas de outros Estados-Membros com quem celebraram contratos.
As disposições dizem respeito não só a questões meramente pragmáticas, mas também ao programa sectorial plurianual, que prevê a cooperação em termos de uma pesca responsável e sustentável, e de uma investigação científica conjunta. A consequência mais importante deste acordo consiste na criação de 230 empregos a bordo, em benefício da população das Seicheles, de 2 900 postos de trabalho nas Seicheles e de 760 postos de trabalho induzidos na Europa em diversas áreas do sector, algo que irá, sem dúvida, contribuir para a melhoria da situação económica no domínio das pescas.
As disposições sobre a venda de mercadorias e os contratos de serviços merecem prioridade.
As divergências no direito dos contratos entre Estados-Membros geram problemas estruturais que desencorajam as empresas e os consumidores. A proposta de resolução da senhora deputada Wallis favorece a criação de um instrumento facultativo para o direito europeu dos contratos para os consumidores e as empresas através de um regulamento geral, pelo que votei a favor do texto.
As divergências nos direitos da lei dos contratos têm de ser colmatadas, e a criação de um instrumento facultativo para o direito europeu dos contratos através de um regulamento, que complementaria, e não substituiria, os regimes nacionais de direito dos contratos, constitui uma óptima solução que concederia às partes a liberdade de escolher o instrumento jurídico mais adequado às suas necessidades.
As duas instituições pretendem apoiar-se mutuamente e ter uma abordagem semelhante do Quadro Financeiro Plurianual.
As duas partes necessitam ainda de chegar a acordo em vários capítulos cruciais das negociações, nomeadamente os respeitantes ao acesso aos mercados de contratos públicos, ao investimento e aos serviços públicos. Há duas outras questões abordadas nas negociações que são muito sensíveis para o PE. A primeira diz respeito às areias asfálticas canadianas e à Directiva da UE relativa à qualidade dos combustíveis.
As dúvidas em torno das consequências da transposição da presente directiva para cada Estado-Membro e a supressão da alteração aprovada pelos nossos colegas na comissão levam-me a abster-me.
As eleições legislativas realizadas em 7 de Novembro de 2010 não foram suficientes para representar um progresso significativo no desenvolvimento democrático desse país.
As emissões de CO2 não conhecem fronteiras e continuam após a transferência da produção, o que terá um impacto inevitavelmente negativo sobre o ambiente, pelo que a economia da União Europeia ficará a perder, uma vez que está a exportar empregos.
As empresas europeias e canadianas poderão economizar milhões de euros por ano graças a procedimentos de certificação de produtos mais rápidos e mais simples e, consequentemente, menos onerosos, e à aceitação recíproca dos resultados da certificação. Por outro lado, o Acordo constitui um benefício líquido para a União Europeia, uma vez que estabelecerá a aceitação recíproca dos resultados do procedimento de certificação em todos os domínios da aeronavegabilidade, para todos os Estados-Membros. O Acordo não só fará com que os mercados canadianos e europeus sejam mais competitivos, como torná-los-á mais seguros para passageiros e transportes de carga, dado promoverem uma cooperação em todos os domínios respeitantes à certificação, inspecção e aplicação.
As empresas europeias não beneficiam, portanto, de condições de concorrência equitativa nos mercados de contratos públicos de outros países.
As empresas europeias têm tido um melhor acesso aos sectores das telecomunicações, da construção automóvel, do retalho e dos seguros no Japão, e isso não tem prejudicado a economia japonesa, bem pelo contrário, tem incentivado a inovação e o desenvolvimento naquele país. Penso, pois, que os presságios são bons.
As empresas internacionais são os principais actores no que se refere à aplicação de normas sociais. É, pois, absolutamente crucial definir clara e inequivocamente a responsabilidade social das empresas, de modo a podermos reduzir o número de interpretações divergentes, estabelecer obrigações mínimas neste domínio e definir um método de controlo do seu cumprimento.
As empresas também devem contribuir para o desenvolvimento sustentável, para criar boas condições para os trabalhadores, mas a grande diferença entre países desenvolvidos e países em desenvolvimento reside ainda nos respectivos sistemas de protecção social.
As empresas têm de enfrentar mais complicações administrativas, a verificação das etiquetas requer mais formalidades aduaneiras e, em última análise, a importação de produtos torna-se mais cara.
As estatísticas da UE mostram que mais de 25% dos jovens lituanos são forçados a aceitar trabalhos de baixa remuneração e a assinar contratos de curto prazo com garantias insuficientes de segurança social.
As estatísticas demonstram que cerca de um em cada três jovens europeus já experimentou uma droga ilícita e que, pelo menos, um dos nossos cidadãos morre a cada hora devido a overdose de droga. A nível europeu, também é importante dispor de informação factual e objectiva da Croácia em relação às drogas e à toxicodependência e suas consequências, ao mesmo tempo que a República da Croácia pode obter informações sobre as melhores práticas para compreender a natureza dos seus problemas de droga e reagir a eles da melhor forma.
As estirpes de bactérias não-patogénicas multirresistentes representam igualmente um risco, tendo em conta a possibilidade de transferências transgénicas e, segundo os estudos mais recentes, de resistência partilhada. O surgimento de novas estirpes de bactérias multirresistentes pode privar as gerações futuras da possibilidade de recorrerem com eficácia aos antibióticos.
As euro-obrigações são uma forma de a UE se endividar ao lado dos Estados-Membros, e eu também não quero que isso aconteça. Por estes motivos, não posso apoiar o relatório.
As exportações da UE para o Japão, em relação ao PIB do Japão, são inferiores a 2%, bem abaixo deste rácio nos outros mercados principais da UE (os EUA, China, Coreia e Índia). Há, portanto, um considerável potencial económico não realizado, que poderia ser explorado através do fortalecimento dos laços comerciais entre os dois blocos.
As expulsões a seguir à Segunda Guerra Mundial também deixaram feridas profundas, tal como as expulsões durante a guerra na antiga Jugoslávia.
As florestas cobrem mais de 42% do território da União. A indústria da madeira proporciona dois milhões de empregos, principalmente em PME, e gera receitas na ordem dos 300 mil milhões de euros. A gestão florestal emprega 350 000 pessoas. O rácio entre o abate e o acréscimo estabilizou na União, situando-se em torno dos 60%, mas prevê-se que este rácio aumente em diversos países para mais de 100%, causando uma diminuição do volume em crescimento após 2020.
As florestas constituem bioesferas que armazenam carbono e revestem particular importância para a preservação ambiental e a protecção contra as catástrofes naturais.
As florestas constituem um importante meio de subsistência e uma fonte de bem-estar dentro das nossas fronteiras.
As florestas da UE enfrentam grandes ameaças devido às alterações climáticas, às novas pragas, ao risco aacrescido de incêndio (sobretudo na região mediterrânica) e à actividade humana (crescente procura de biomassa lenhosa no sector da energia), que está a causar a desflorestação. Concordo que a Comissão e os Estados-Membros têm de intensificar os esforços para alcançar os objectivos do Plano de Acção para as Florestas em matéria de ambiente e qualidade de vida, cuja implementação está atrasada. A estratégia florestal da UE e o plano de acção para as florestas também têm de ser actualizados, a fim de incluírem a dimensão das alterações climáticas e questões mais amplas da protecção das florestas.
As florestas da UE estão, mais do que nunca, sujeitas a grandes pressões, não tanto por causa das alterações climáticas, mas sobretudo devido a algumas decisões que a UE adoptou para as combater. O facto de agora, com este relatório, solicitarmos a elaboração de critérios de sustentabilidade juridicamente vinculativos para a biomassa utilizada para fins energéticos é uma iniciativa importante. A legislação comunitária em matéria de biocombustíveis e a legislação sobre energias renováveis deram um rumo insustentável à utilização das nossas florestas.
As florestas dão um importante contributo para a atenuação das alterações climáticas e para a adaptação das sociedades europeias, através da continuidade das suas funções a nível económico, social e ambiental.
As florestas e a silvicultura europeias são regidas por uma variedade de modelos regionais e nacionais, agrupados de acordo com sua orientação produtiva ou de protecção. As florestas facultam quer recursos quer funções do ecossistema. O relatório propõe a elaboração de programas obrigatórios.
As florestas e demais zonas arborizadas abrangem mais de 42% da superfície da UE, representando um meio de subsistência para milhões de trabalhadores. A conservação do património florestal representa um contributo importante para o bem-estar das populações e a criação de emprego nas zonas rurais, devendo ser indissociável da prevenção de incêndios florestais, catástrofe que dizima extensas áreas de floresta anualmente, no Sul da Europa e nomeadamente em Portugal.
As florestas e demais zonas arborizadas abrangem mais de 42% da superfície da UE, representando um meio de subsistência para milhões de trabalhadores. A sua conservação representa um contributo importante para o bem-estar das populações e a criação de emprego nas zonas rurais, devendo ser indissociável da prevenção de incêndios florestais, catástrofe que dizima extensas áreas de floresta no Sul da Europa, nomeadamente em Portugal.
As florestas e outras zonas arborizadas cobrem mais de 42% da superfície da UE, constituindo o meio de subsistência de milhões de trabalhadores, empresários e de 16 milhões de proprietários florestais.
As florestas e zonas arborizadas cobrem 42% da superfície da UE. Apesar de desaparecerem anualmente cerca de 500 000 hectares de floresta, em consequência de incêndios florestais e da exploração madeireira ilegal, a tendência para o aumento da cobertura florestal no território da UE parece ser estável a longo prazo.
As florestas europeias podem ser agrupadas em cinco zonas bioclimáticas: boreal, temperada oceânica, temperada continental, mediterrânica e de montanha, de acordo com a tipologia de florestas da AEA, a qual foi elaborada para orientar as decisões políticas.
As florestas na União Europeia abrangem mais de 42% da superfície da UE e representam 16 milhões de proprietários florestais, proporcionando mais de 2 milhões de empregos directos, principalmente em PME, e representando um volume de negócios de 300 mil milhões de euros, para além do seu impacto positivo e essencial em matéria de combate às alterações climáticas devido à sua capacidade de fixação do dióxido de carbono e libertação de oxigénio.
As florestas prestam-nos muitos serviços ecológicos essenciais, que vão desde regular o ciclo da água até impedir a erosão do solo e sequestrar o carbono.
As florestas representam um recurso valioso para o sector agrícola, o ambiente e a biodiversidade, especialmente em virtude dos ecossistemas que albergam e em termos de fertilidade dos solos e protecção dos solos contra a erosão. O sector silvícola europeu encerra um grande potencial de desenvolvimento no que se refere ao sequestro de carbono e aos sumidouros de CO2.
As formas de passar do trabalho informal ou não declarado ao emprego regular serão abrangidas pelos princípios orientadores sobre as condições que conduzem à criação de emprego anunciadas pela Comissão na comunicação sobre a Iniciativa Emblemática Europa 2020, "Agenda para novas qualificações e novos empregos". Apresentaremos esses princípios orientadores no próximo ano. Vários Estados-Membros possuem uma experiência de trabalho útil na redução do sector informal e do emprego precário, nomeadamente através da criação de sistemas de cheques-serviço.
As frequências de transmissão são um bem nacional. A legislação europeia deve, por conseguinte, respeitar a soberania dos Estados-Membros ao procurar um interesse europeu comum na utilização destas frequências.
As ideias de Valentin Inzko, Alto Representante da comunidade internacional e Representante Especial da UE para a Bósnia e Herzegovina, a respeito da abordagem a ter com a Sérvia não resolverão a situação, bem pelo contrário.
As imagens de pessoas que perderam os seus meios de subsistência podem já não estar presentes na memória de todos, mas não devemos esquecer os custos imensos dessas inundações devastadoras, tanto em termos das necessidades humanitárias como da devastação económica.
As indústrias culturais e criativas (ICC) devem estar no centro de uma nova agenda política europeia, em consonância com as necessidades económicas do sector e as medidas de adaptação às inovações da era digital.
As indústrias culturais e criativas desempenham um papel duplo: detêm um papel económico, ao apoiarem o emprego, o crescimento e a criação de riqueza e, acima de tudo, desempenham um papel cultural, ao contribuírem para o desenvolvimento social e cultural dos cidadãos. No entanto, para concretizarem plenamente o seu potencial, é necessário o cumprimento de duas condições básicas.
As indústrias culturais e criativas já são importantes factores de motivação e de influência na economia, muito embora a sua situação nem sempre seja favorável.
As indústrias culturais e criativas representam 5 milhões de empregos e 2,6% do PIB da UE. Constituem igualmente um dos principais motores do crescimento europeu, uma vez que criam novos postos de trabalho e estimulam a inovação. Além disso, criam valor acrescentado enquanto factores de coesão social e desempenham um importante papel na promoção da diversidade cultural e linguística da UE. Por conseguinte, é essencial apoiar estes sectores, de um ponto de vista económico e social. É este o motivo do meu voto a favor deste relatório.
As indústrias culturais e criativas são importantes - como muitos dos senhores deputados referiram - enquanto motor do desenvolvimento e da criação de emprego.
As indústrias culturais europeias contribuem para o empreendedorismo, a inovação e a actividade empresarial, e a diversidade da paisagem cultural da UE faz desta o destino turístico global mais atractivo do mundo.
As indústrias florestais geram receitas superiores a 300 mil milhões de euros e proporcionam emprego a cerca de dois milhões de pessoas. São estes os números que devemos ter presentes para percebermos a importância de uma estratégia europeia para uma gestão florestal sustentável e para uma protecção mais eficaz deste importante património europeu.
As indústrias florestais primárias na UE proporcionam mais de 2 milhões de empregos, principalmente em PME, e representam um volume de negócios de 300 mil milhões de euros.
As indústrias florestais primárias proporcionam mais de 2 milhões de empregos, principalmente em PME. A gestão florestal emprega 350 000 pessoas. O rácio comunitário entre o abate e o acréscimo estabilizou-se em torno dos 60%. Prevê-se que este rácio aumente em diversos países para mais de 100%, causando uma diminuição do volume em crescimento após 2020.
As indústrias florestais primárias, com um volume de negócios superior a 300 mil milhões de euros, proporcionam mais de dois milhões de empregos, sobretudo em zonas rurais, contribuindo para o crescimento económico, o emprego e a prosperidade ao fornecerem madeira e abrirem perspectivas ao turismo.
As informações devem servir para analisar a procura de droga e os meios de a reduzir, bem como, de um modo geral, os fenómenos associados ao mercado da droga.
As informações do actual quadro financeiro mostram que, em vez de serem utilizados para satisfazer as necessidades das bases populares, os fundos disponíveis ao abrigo do orçamento euro-unificador estão a ser dirigidos contra elas, a fim de apoiar a rentabilidade dos grupos monopolistas. É uma mentira suja que o elemento básico do relatório seja a alegada exigência do Parlamento Europeu de um aumento de 5 % das despesas ao abrigo do orçamento da UE após 2013. O elemento preponderante do relatório é o facto de solicitar não só este aumento, como também que todas as despesas abrangidas pelo orçamento da UE sejam direccionadas para a promoção das medidas bárbaras lançadas pelo capital, pela UE e pelos governos burgueses contra as classes trabalhadoras e as classes populares em todos os Estados-Membros. O relatório apela a que o dinheiro dos trabalhadores dos Estados-Membros que financiam o orçamento da UE seja utilizado para promover reestruturações capitalistas, para eliminar os direitos laborais, para apoiar a rentabilidade dos monopólios euro-unificadores, para consolidar os mecanismos dos "memorandos" e proteger os prestamistas nos Estados-Membros devedores e para apoiar mecanismos repressivos e interferências imperialistas da UE.
As informações fornecidas pelo Observatório constituem uma base para analisar a procura de drogas que penetram na UE e todos os fenómenos associados ao mercado das drogas, para que seja possível encontrar a melhor forma de combater estes problemas. O Observatório está aberto à participação de qualquer país terceiro que partilhe dos interesses da União e dos seus Estados-Membros relativamente aos seus objectivos e ao seu trabalho. A Croácia pediu para participar nas actividades do Observatório em 2005 e, em 2006, o Conselho autorizou a Comissão a encetar negociações com a República da Croácia.
As informações obtidas podem constituir um fundamento importante para as decisões em matéria de política ambiental. A proposta de regulamento apenas prevê a recolha e a compilação de dados no âmbito das emissões para a atmosfera, dos impostos ambientais por actividade económica e das contas de fluxos de materiais para a economia.
As informações sobre os recursos florestais, o estado das florestas e o impacto das alterações climáticas são, igualmente, essenciais para assegurar que as decisões tomadas em relação às florestas proporcionem os maiores benefícios possíveis em termos socioeconómicos e ecológicos.
As iniciativas, que são de grande interesse para a produção artesanal ao nível regional e local, incluem também o desenvolvimento de uma rede de boas práticas para as colectividades regionais e locais e a implementação de serviços de aconselhamento em matéria de financiamento para permitir às PME do sector uma melhor informação sobre a produção e a distribuição de bens e serviços culturais e criativos.
As instituições criadas ao abrigo dos acordos obtidos ao nível interparlamentar e intergovernamental destinam-se à consecução desses fins; são estas as instâncias adequadas para exigir explicações face a eventuais violações de direitos e para promover com eficácia bons comportamentos e reformas democráticas.
As instituições da UE devem ser a voz da razão e combater esta distracção que alguns estão a tentar criar. O Parlamento Europeu e o Conselho devem cumprir a legislação europeia, e a Comissão tem de verificar este cumprimento enquanto guardiã dos Tratados.
As instituições europeias são igualmente responsáveis pelo cumprimento destes princípios pelos Estados-Membros após a adesão. Gostaria de lembrar-vos desta responsabilidade e, em particular, ao Presidente da Comissão e à Senhora Comissária, que são os principais responsáveis neste âmbito. O conteúdo da nova Constituição húngara e as circunstâncias da sua redacção não respeitam estes princípios fundamentais.
As instituições financeiras devem ser instadas a preparar e publicar relatórios anuais sobre a adequação e a eficácia dos respectivos sistemas de controlo interno, devendo os conselhos de administração proceder à adopção desses relatórios.
As intervenções nas zonas rurais devem ser abrangidas também pelo Fundo Europeu Agrícola de Desenvolvimento Rural, cuja finalidade não se cinge a apoiar os agricultores, mas também a apoiar as zonas rurais.
As isenções para EURO V e EURO VI são também positivas, bem como o facto de os Estados-Membros, mais uma vez, terem assumido o compromisso de regulamentar a interoperabilidade dos sistemas de portagem, pois a ausência de regulamentação nesse domínio é, no nosso entender, lamentável.
As lacunas jurídicas que permitem estas exportações perigosas devem ser supridas. A regulamentação existente sobre as transferências de resíduos tóxicos para países em desenvolvimento deve ser mais rigorosa, assim como a sua aplicação. Precisamos de uma proposta legislativa relativa às inspecções ambientais, algo para o qual o Parlamento apelou já em 2008, para que os navios possam ser eficazmente inspeccionados pelas autoridades portuárias locais.
As linhas vermelhas encontram-se gravadas, por assim dizer, em pedra, e espero que não avancemos demasiado, fazendo demasiadas concessões.
As maiores instituições financeiras, os maiores bancos têm de passar para propriedade pública democrática. A ditadura dos mercados financeiros tem de terminar e os seus recursos maciços deveriam ser utilizados para beneficiar pessoas comuns, através da concessão de créditos a pequenas empresas, de hipotecas acessíveis para ajudar os compradores de casas, etc.
As mais elevadas normas em matéria de segurança nuclear deveriam, por isso, ser juridicamente vinculativas e globais, as instalações nucleares em toda a parte deveriam ter um nível equivalente de segurança e a Agência Europeia de Energia Atómica (AIEA) deveria ser reforçada.
As manifestações pacíficas das últimas semanas motivaram uma repressão mais própria de um país árabe do que de um país europeu, por um regime de 18 anos que aniquilou lentamente qualquer esperança de progresso. A participação continuada deste país na Política Europeia de Vizinhança tem de estar dependente de reformas democráticas, e não da sua vontade de fornecer petróleo ao oleoduto Nabucco.
As medidas apresentadas no primeiro programa para a política do espectro radioeléctrico são vitais para reduzir o fosso digital e para oferecer serviços de telecomunicações rápidos e fiáveis a zonas rurais e isoladas, a fim de as revitalizar.
As medidas de apoio à Grécia, à Irlanda e a Portugal têm de ser robustas, para se poder recuperar a estabilidade financeira e económica. O pacote deverá abrir o caminho para finanças públicas sustentáveis e para o crescimento económico.
As medidas de política comercial europeias no sector dos têxteis podem ser geridas sem que seja imposto o encargo excessivo da apresentação da prova de origem para todas as importações. Para manter o controlo das importações de produtos têxteis que continuam sujeitos a restrições quantitativas e que têm a sua origem em países que ainda não são membros da OMC, a UE recorrerá agora às autorizações de importação. Entretanto, no que diz respeito às categorias de produtos abrangidos pela Secção XI da Nomenclatura Combinada não sujeitos a restrições quantitativas e, consequentemente, introduzidos em livre prática na União Europeia, está a ser aplicado um sistema de vigilância estatística ex post para monitorizar o impacto das mesmas no mercado da UE. Recordamos que, além dos supracitados mecanismos de controlo das importações, é obrigatória, desde 2010, a indicação do país de origem de alguns produtos de países terceiros, para uma melhor informação dos consumidores sobre a sua origem.
As medidas de política comercial muito limitadas aplicadas pela UE no sector dos têxteis podem ser geridas sem que seja imposto o encargo excessivo da apresentação da prova de origem para todas as importações. Contudo, as medidas de controlo para as importações de produtos têxteis devem ser mantidas.
As medidas hoje votadas pretendem reforçar os instrumentos que não funcionaram, por isso a sua aplicação concreta revela-se essencial. O critério da dívida, como aprovado no Tratado de Maastricht, é finalmente operacionalizado neste novo pacote e passará a ter a sua efectiva aplicação. A institucionalização do semestre europeu, o reforço do diálogo entre as instituições europeias e as entidades nacionais, o papel do Parlamento e da Comissão em todo o processo de acompanhamento, bem como uma maior e mais eficaz supervisão são formas de se alcançar um crescimento europeu inteligente, sustentável e inclusivo.
As medidas propostas neste relatório irão contribuir efectivamente para o cumprimento dos objectivos da Estratégia "Europa 2020" quando forem aplicadas directamente no terreno.
As medidas que contribuam para aumentar essa transparência são por isso bem-vindas e necessárias. Não é, todavia, claro que esse venha a ser o resultado de todas as modificações agora propostas.
As medidas que visam aumentar ainda mais o objectivo de redução das emissões são prejudiciais para toda a indústria europeia. A pressão que a política em matéria de alterações climáticas exerce sobre a indústria implicará a sua deslocalização para países cujas políticas neste domínio dão prova de maior sensatez.
As medidas relativas ao ensino e à formação profissionais são absolutamente fundamentais para a transformação da economia europeia numa economia do conhecimento, em cumprimento dos objectivos da Estratégia "Europa 2020”. Daí o meu apoio total às recomendações do relatório, que sublinham a importância do investimento no ensino e na formação profissionais para a competitividade futura da economia europeia.
As medidas tomadas pela Comissão são totalmente coerentes, visto que já apresentámos as linhas gerais desta política na comunicação emitida pela Comissão em Novembro último.
As melhorias foram decepcionantes pela sua lentidão. No seu relatório mais recente sobre estas questões (Fevereiro de 2011), a Comissão declarou que a Bulgária tinha de melhorar ainda mais a estrutura, gestão e cooperação dos órgãos judiciais, policiais e de investigação. Não obstante, os 27 governos do Conselho concluíram, talvez surpreendentemente, que a Bulgária cumprira as condições de Schengen, um sistema que está igualmente a ser questionado neste momento. O Reino Unido, naturalmente, permanece fora do espaço Schengen.
As micro, pequenas e médias empresas desempenham um papel central e essencial no crescimento da economia europeia; constituem a principal fonte de emprego e exercem um impacto fundamental no desenvolvimento da competitividade e inovação europeias.
As minhas expectativas em relação ao próximo Conselho são bastante baixas porque na União Europeia reina a divisão: em vez de decisão há hesitação, em vez de solidariedade há egoísmo. E é assim que vai a Europa.
As minhas palavras de apoio - e fiquei aliviada ao ler nos jornais de domingo que a senhora baronesa negou que ia abandonar o seu cargo - são as seguintes: sendo eu uma pessoa que critica vigorosamente a ideia de uma política europeia comum e de a UE retirar soberania ao meu país, desejo que permaneça no seu cargo o mais tempo possível, porque enquanto lá estiver não creio que venhamos a ter um grande problema de perda de soberania.
As minhas preocupações centrais são a protecção do consumidor, a segurança alimentar aplicada nestes novos produtos, e a informação correcta.
As minhas primeiras palavras são para enaltecer o trabalho desenvolvido pelo relator, o colega Georgios Stavrakakis, que fez um extraordinário trabalho ao identificar as futuras sinergias para uma eficácia reforçada entre os vários Fundos Estruturais. O seu relatório insere-se também neste debate conjunto sobre a política de coesão, debate que assume a maior importância não só pela substância do tema, mas também sobretudo pela oportunidade em termos do timing da sua discussão.
As minhas propostas dizem igualmente respeito à pertinência ou não de um funcionário da Comissão - para além do seu direito a férias anuais, note-se - ter direito a ausentar-se do serviço até sete semanas pagas, e isto para todos os que auferem mais de 10 000 euros líquidos por mês. Na minha opinião, as horas extraordinárias deverão ser definitivamente incluídas nesse salário. O que está aqui em causa é a criação de novos postos de trabalho.
As moedas têm de ser cobertas com alguns elementos de segurança especiais para limitar os riscos de fraude. O facto de terem um lado europeu e um lado nacional é uma expressão apropriada da ideia da União Monetária Europeia entre os Estados-Membros.
As mulheres representam 90% destes trabalhadores, e não exercem a sua actividade de forma colectiva, mas isoladas, em casas particulares. O propósito do seu trabalho não é criar um valor acrescentado, mas prestar cuidados ou serviços semelhantes às tarefas que as mulheres desempenham normalmente sem remuneração nas suas próprias casas.
As nações são impotentes para actuar individualmente perante os desafios extraordinários dos nossos tempos. A acção multilateral é a única forma de os Estados poderem lidar com os desafios com que o nosso mundo se confronta.
As necessidades e as expectativas do povo são gigantescas, e se não quisermos que estas pessoas fiquem desapontadas com a independência, então o desenvolvimento e a acção humanitária terão de continuar ainda durante muito tempo. É preciso que mantenhamos isto bem gravado na nossa mente.
As negociações com o Japão, tendo em vista aprofundar relações comerciais, não podem ser utilizadas como um instrumento de classe ao serviço dos grandes grupos económicos e financeiros, promovendo uma crescente exploração dos trabalhadores e dos povos, a destruição das forças produtivas e a destruição do ambiente.
As negociações do Sétimo Programa-Quadro tiverem lugar em 2006 e abrangem - repito - o período 2007-2013.
As negociações entre a Troika e as autoridades portuguesas já terminaram e o acordo relativo ao memorando de entendimento sobre as condições políticas associadas à assistência financeira está a ser finalizado.
As negociações entre a União Europeia e a Índia para a celebração de um Acordo de Comércio Livre sofreram uma evolução significativa. A Índia está a assumir uma nova posição no contexto geopolítico internacional, tendo passado de país beneficiário da ajuda ao desenvolvimento a país doador. O presente acordo reveste particular importância.
As negociações levaram a alguns pequenos resultados positivos - penso aqui na interoperabilidade do mini hire marketing nas zonas de montanha -, mas o resultado geral é insatisfatório.
As normas europeias em matéria de ambiente e saúde não devem ser revistas em baixa apenas para satisfazer o nosso parceiro. A Comissão Europeia deve pesar as consequências da sua decisão de incluir todos os serviços automaticamente e por omissão. Embora este método permita a exclusão de certos serviços públicos caso a caso e a pedido de cada Estado-Membro dado que cria uma "lista negativa”, corre-se o risco de potenciais omissões. O Parlamento não deseja que este novo modelo de negociação possa fazer jurisprudência.
As normas laborais essenciais contidas nas oito convenções da OIT referem-se, principalmente, à liberdade de associação e de negociação colectiva, à eliminação do trabalho forçado e obrigatório, à eliminação da discriminação em matéria de emprego e profissão e à abolição do trabalho infantil.
As normas laborais essenciais estão contidas nas oito convenções da OIT relativas à liberdade de associação e de negociação colectiva, à eliminação do trabalho forçado e obrigatório, à eliminação da discriminação em matéria de emprego e profissão e à abolição do trabalho infantil.
As normas laborais internacionais devem, sobretudo, garantir os direitos dos trabalhadores, porque o trabalho faz parte do nosso quotidiano e é decisivo para a dignidade, o bem-estar e o desenvolvimento pessoais.
As normas que se aplicam no meu país, a Grécia, onde a taxa de desemprego entre os jovens de 25 anos de idade é de 36,1%, e em Espanha, onde ela é de 43%, são muito diferentes daquelas que se aplicam nas economias europeias fortes.
As nossas acções na Líbia revelarão a verdadeira capacidade da nossa política de segurança e defesa. O objectivo principal da UE na Líbia é proteger a população civil e apoiar a luta do povo líbio com vista à instauração de uma sociedade democrática.
As nossas economias estão demasiado interconectadas para isso e, assim, devo dizer que o que está acontecer nos suscita sentimentos contraditórios.
As nossas instituições europeias sofreram um fracasso colectivo importante. O único caminho é aprender com esta experiência de forma construtiva com base em critérios profissionais. É neste espírito que me dirijo hoje a este Plenário.
As nossas prioridades são o crescimento inteligente, sustentável e inclusivo, o apoio à investigação, desenvolvimento, inovação, crescimento e trabalho, e o incentivo ao desenvolvimento das pequenas e médias empresas.
As notações das ANC cumprem diversos objectivos úteis.
As notações permitem aos emitentes acederem aos mercados global e doméstico, reduzindo os custos da informação e alargando o número de potenciais investidores, proporcionando assim liquidez aos mercados e assistindo na fixação de preços. A recente crise financeira realçou que existem três problemas fundamentais neste sector: falta de concorrência, excesso de confiança nas notações externas no quadro regulamentar e ausência de responsabilidade pelas notações das ANC.
As novas abordagens, por exemplo no domínio das estratégias macro-regionais, demonstram o potencial da cooperação transfronteiriça.
As novas autoridades egípcias beneficiaram da simpatia generalizada e de apoio directo, político e financeiro, da UE. Porém, agora, depois de queimadas igrejas e assassinados cristãos numa nova vaga de ataques, chegou a hora de a UE deixar bem claro às autoridades egípcias que estas são responsáveis pela segurança interna do país e pela protecção dos direitos e meios de subsistência de todos os cidadãos egípcios.
As novas disposições da política comum de segurança e defesa (PCSD) introduzidas pelo Tratado de Lisboa apresentam um quadro jurídico mais claro destinado a reforçar a implementação da política externa e de segurança, servindo-se de todos os instrumentos à disposição da União e dos seus Estados-Membros a fim de prevenir e gerir crises e conflitos e construir uma paz duradoura.
As novas regras oferecem aos consumidores mais segurança e confiança ao fazerem compras, principalmente ao utilizarem a Internet.
As novas regras para a etiquetagem de produtos têxteis são muito importantes para evitar problemas aos consumidores menos informados. A presença de materiais derivados de animais tem de ser claramente indicada, de modo a evitar que os consumidores ou pessoas que sofram de alergias corram o risco de comprar inadvertidamente produtos em pele verdadeira, quando prefeririam não o fazer. O objectivo inicial desta proposta é simplificar e melhorar o quadro regulamentar existente para a etiquetagem dos produtos têxteis.
As novas tarefas que a agricultura tem enfrentado no contexto do ambiente e do clima, do bem-estar dos animais e das negociações irrealistas com a Organização Mundial do Comércio implicam custos adicionais para os agricultores.
As novas tecnologias oferecem novas oportunidades de divulgação do património cultural europeu e de reforço dos laços transnacionais.
As obras começaram ainda antes de a avaliação de impacto ambiental estar concluída e, até agora, não houve qualquer explicação quanto aos critérios da escolha do local da construção de nenhuma das duas centrais nucleares, não se analisaram possíveis locais alternativos e não se elaboraram planos gerais de evacuação. Existem planos para que ambas as centrais nucleares tenham reactores experimentais, cuja segurança é impossível de avaliar uma vez que ainda não estiveram em actividade em lado nenhum.
As oportunidades criadas pelo financiamento público, em particular pelos Fundos Estruturais, não são plenamente exploradas. A criatividade e a cultura devem ser consideradas elementos cruciais da nossa política e a Europa deve a si própria o esforço de as promover.
As opções estratégicas incluem opções não vinculativas ("soft law”), um regime facultativo ("opt-in”) designado como 28.º regime, uma aproximação do direito substantivo nacional (improvável devido à resistência do Conselho e à impossibilidade de fundir as tradições jurídicas nacionais instantaneamente) e a opção de criação de um verdadeiro código civil europeu.
As ordens pan-europeias relativas ao congelamento e à declaração do património dos autores de fraudes são fundamentais porque, actualmente, essas pessoas ficam impunes, enquanto as vítimas ficam a perder e são confrontadas com despesas judiciais elevadas.
As organizações do sector têm feito uma série de pedidos de ajuda estatal a favor do sector, mas ignoram em absoluto o regulamento que permite as ajudas de minimis.
As orientações e as políticas neoliberais desenvolvidas pela UE têm posto em causa o progresso social e infligido duros golpes aos povos europeus. O agravamento das desigualdades sociais nos países da UE, que hoje atingem níveis preocupantes, é disso exemplo elucidativo.
As orientações para o orçamento, assumidas pela maioria do PE, são "inteiramente conformes com a dinâmica do Semestre Europeu", procurando impor ajustamentos estruturais de conteúdo neoliberal. É inaceitável que perante a gravíssima crise que afecta as economias mais vulneráveis da UE, se persista em exigências incomportáveis relativamente ao co-financiamento para utilização dos Fundos comunitários, designadamente dos Fundos Estruturais.
As outras faixas deveriam ser libertadas até 1 de Janeiro de 2012, como estipulado na proposta da Comissão. Na minha opinião, deveríamos fazer pressão no sentido da atribuição de mais frequências para os serviços móveis, com uma meta mínima de 1 200 MHz. É essencial introduzir normas razoáveis que possibilitem a libertação de mais faixas do espectro no futuro.
As patentes europeias custam actualmente 15 vezes mais do que as patentes norte-americanas, daí a razão pela qual devemos desenvolver a patente europeia mais rapidamente e reduzir o seu custo. Há grandes invenções que estão a ser desenvolvidas em muitos dos novos Estados-Membros, mas a falta de financiamento obriga os investigadores a vendê-las a outros países e empresas por alguns milhares de euros, quando na realidade podem valer milhões. Quanto às patentes obtidas com financiamento público, é importante que universidades e particulares possam compartilhar os direitos de propriedade intelectual assim criados. A União Europeia deve reforçar a protecção da propriedade intelectual para proteger a nossa tecnologia e saber-fazer da pirataria e da fraude, especialmente mediante a celebração de acordos com países terceiros.
As peculiaridades e os diferentes problemas de cada país reflectem-se, sem dúvida, nos diferentes programas de reformas, os quais, apesar disso, se pautam por uma filosofia assente numa ênfase absoluta em reformas orçamentais rápidas.
As pequenas e médias empresas (PME) desejavam um maior grau de participação, e chegámos a um valor próximo dos 15%, que poderia ainda melhorar com mais simplificação. Havia igualmente necessidade de mais financiamento, principalmente privado, que continua a ser uma fraqueza, não só devido à crise, mas porque certos instrumentos como as iniciativas tecnológicas conjuntas (ITC) são francamente susceptíveis de ser melhoradas.
As pequenas e médias empresas (PME) europeias são o pulmão da nossa actividade económica. O desenvolvimento, a modernização e a competitividade das PME devem estar no coração da nossa estratégia económica.
As pequenas e médias empresas - o esteio do desempenho económico da Europa, mesmo em situações difíceis de crise - são apanhadas como locais onde a inovação ocorre diariamente.
As pequenas e médias empresas prestam um grande contributo à economia europeia, uma vez que a grande maioria das empresas pertencem a esta categoria e no seu conjunto oferecem emprego a mais de 90 milhões de pessoas em toda a Europa.
As perguntas estão escritas, constam do documento que apresentámos e creio que são suficientemente claras para obtermos um progresso em matéria de informação pública sobre esta importante negociação comercial entre a União Europeia e um dos nossos grandes parceiros comerciais.
As perguntas seguintes são dirigidas à Comissão.
As pessoas alérgicas, em especial, saem a ganhar com esta proposta, uma vez que as peles são potencialmente perigosas para a sua saúde e, sem uma etiquetagem adequada, podem comprar um produto que contenha estes têxteis sem se aperceberem.
As pessoas dependem cada vez mais da Internet para aceder à informação e só podem expressar-se livremente quando essa informação e as suas comunicações não são alvo de censura. O exercício do direito ao desenvolvimento cultural e de outros direitos fundamentais é cada vez mais facilitado pelas novas tecnologias. O acesso a conteúdos culturais também se faz através dos novos meios de comunicação social, e as oportunidades para estabelecer uma conectividade global em torno de bens e conteúdos culturais europeus devem ser celebradas e facilitadas, por exemplo, através da "Europeana” ou de sítios Web de museus e festivais. É importante que a UE desenvolva uma estratégia sobre a liberdade na Internet.
As pessoas estão nas ruas, há violência e, sinceramente, penso que as coisas só podem piorar. Não lhes tiraram só o dinheiro; privaram-nas também da democracia.
As pessoas não são mercadorias cujo preço possa ser negociado. O trabalho faz parte da nossa vida quotidiana e é fundamental para a dignidade, o bem-estar e o desenvolvimento das pessoas. A UE desfruta de uma boa reputação em termos de diálogo internacional sobre questões sociais.
As pessoas que iniciaram este debate devem apresentar um pedido de desculpas não só à senhora Comissária, como também a todos os cidadãos europeus, porque é precisamente este género de comportamento do Parlamento que conduz à falta de interesse dos cidadãos europeus nas suas actividades, ao desapontamento e à fraca participação nas eleições europeias.
As pessoas que não estão sujeitas ao controlo público dos eleitores, por muito boas que sejam as suas intenções, não podem realizar uma supervisão em que se sobrepõem a organismos políticos nacionais ou às mais importantes instituições nacionais.
As pessoas que sofrem de alergias, em particular, ficam a ganhar com esta proposta, uma vez que a pele de animais é potencialmente perigosa para a sua saúde e a Comissão tem também de estudar a possibilidade de materiais potencialmente perigosos e produtos químicos usados em têxteis poderem causar reacções alérgicas.
As pessoas têm de ter condições que lhes permitam desenvolver e alargar as suas competências. O desenvolvimento de competências não pode ter como único fim ajudar as pessoas a encontrar um melhor emprego - tem de lhes dar também a oportunidade de criarem os empregos do futuro e prestarem assim um contributo activo para uma economia inovadora.
As políticas da União Europeia precisam de um apoio adequado em negociações internacionais, e os Estados-Membros podem precisar também de assistência na negociação com vizinhos não europeus.
As políticas de transportes e de energia têm de ser melhoradas. A afectação de fundos à investigação e desenvolvimento, a nível europeu e nacional, tem de garantir o progresso de todas as políticas europeias. O período de sete anos, a nova estrutura proposta e uma maior flexibilidade proporcionam mais segurança à aplicação e à adaptação de novas prioridades. A bem da estabilidade, o sistema de recursos do orçamento da UE tem de ser repensado a fim de substituir as actuais contribuições nacionais por recursos europeus.
As políticas europeias regional e de coesão respondem a esses desafios. A principal finalidade da Agenda Urbana reforçada é a de servir o desenvolvimento e a actualização qualitativa das infra-estruturas e serviços nas cidades europeias.
As políticas que contribuem para o aumento da produtividade, em especial as políticas em matéria de energia ecológica e de investigação e desenvolvimento, devem ser reconhecidas como o motor do futuro económico da UE. Outra questão de grande importância, não só para a Irlanda, como também para a UE no seu conjunto, é a política agrícola comum. É reconhecido que haverá alterações significativas após 2013, mas as alterações nos pagamentos efectuados ao abrigo da PAC deverão ser introduzidas de forma gradual para permitir aos agricultores adaptarem-se às novas disposições. Ao mesmo tempo, o orçamento da PAC deve ajudar os agricultores europeus a adaptarem-se aos novos desafios e às novas oportunidades.
As posições tomadas pela UE face aos desenvolvimentos cada vez mais turbulentos nos Balcãs representam outro problema. A UE ainda não encontrou a "chave" para esta região e carece de uma abordagem sistemática. O resultado disso, entre outras coisas, é que o prestígio da UE e os atractivos da adesão à UE entram em queda livre nos países dos Balcãs Ocidentais.
As possibilidades de todos os Estados-Membros da UE obterem crédito nos mercados internacionais em condições adequadas, bem como a estabilidade do sistema financeiro mundial e a eficácia da prevenção de crises, dependem do grau de êxito da reforma da avaliação financeira.
As potências emergentes e as economias emergentes deste mundo não estão à espera que a Europa se divida nas suas partes constituintes, umas de grande dimensão, como a Alemanha, outras de dimensão muito pequena, como Malta, convictas de que cada uma dessas partes sobreviverá sozinha - como defende a retórica da renacionalização que muitos políticos servem aos seus povos. Só sobreviveremos na competição intercontinental - ambiental, económica, financeira e monetária - se nos unirmos. E se partilharmos a vontade de fazer da economia mais forte do mundo - porque é isso que a Europa é se se mantiver unida - um sucesso, com uma atitude unida e solidária.
As preferências continuam em vigor para produtos da Albânia, Croácia, Macedónia e Montenegro.
As preocupações dos políticos franceses com a sua economia e os postos de trabalho nos seus estaleiros navais são compreensíveis.
As prescrições técnicas em causa dizem respeito à aproximação das leis dos Estados-Membros, tendo em vista permitir a aplicação dos procedimentos de homologação CE previstos na Directiva 2003/37/CE relativamente a cada tipo de tractor.
As primeiras experiências vividas pelas crianças compõem a base de toda a aprendizagem subsequente, condicionando o desenvolvimento das crianças e ajudando a inverter eventuais situações de desvantagem e de transmissão de pobreza entre gerações. Ao dotar as crianças de capacidades para concretizar as suas potencialidades, as estruturas de educação e o acolhimento de qualidade podem dar um forte contributo para a concretização de dois dos grandes objectivos da Estratégia Europeia 2020: reduzir para menos de 10 % o abandono escolar precoce e tirar pelo menos 20 milhões de pessoas de situações de pobreza e exclusão social.
As principais alterações propostas pelo Parlamento Europeu e reintroduzidas neste relatório, que votei favoravelmente, dizem respeito a questões que considero da maior importância para o mercado europeu.
As prioridades da Presidência ucraniana do Comité de Ministros do Conselho da Europa são, inter alia, evitar violações dos direitos humanos e defender os princípios do Estado de direito. A Ucrânia também se comprometeu a edificar a democracia a nível local e a fortalecer a auto-governação local.
As prioridades e objectivos políticos definidos são promover o emprego, reforçar a inovação, a investigação e o crescimento, abordar as alterações climáticas, melhorar os níveis de educação, alcançar a integração social e combater a pobreza, complementando políticas em matérias de imigração, e salvaguardar recursos para desenvolver zonas inacessíveis e fronteiriças.
As projecções sugerem que a procura de competências continuará a aumentar. A evolução industrial e tecnológica faz aumentar a procura de mão-de-obra com qualificações elevadas e médias, em detrimento dos trabalhadores menos qualificados.
As propostas apresentadas concedem novos e amplos poderes à Comissão. Se estes poderes se limitassem aos países da área do euro, não teria objectado, mas a Comissão e os vários deputados deste Parlamento - incluindo a senhora Wortmann-Kool, por quem tenho grande respeito - utilizam a crise na área do euro como pretexto para alargar o poder da UE à governação económica do Reino Unido e de outros países que não usam o euro. Não fui eleito para conceder mais poderes à UE sobre a forma como o Reino Unido gere os seus assuntos e, por conseguinte, votarei contra estas propostas.
As propostas apresentadas no relatório para uma melhor utilização harmonizada dos recursos para programas de defesa da UE e a partilha de capacidade militar na União contribuirão para a consecução dos objectivos desta política.
As propostas contidas neste texto são irrealistas e parecem-se mais com mantras entorpecedores; o desperdício e a burocracia têm ainda um futuro risonho pela frente.
As propostas da Comissão constituem um bom ponto de partida, mas devem ser reforçadas, em particular, nos seguintes domínios: é necessário dedicar mais atenção à prevenção de políticas orçamentais e macroeconómicas insustentáveis; necessidade de tratar devidamente os programas nacionais de reforma e os programas de estabilidade e convergência a nível nacional antes de serem submetidos a supervisão a nível da UE; atribuir à Comissão um papel mais enérgico e independente no processo de supervisão; maior independência para a Comissão em relação ao Conselho no que diz respeito ao cumprimento das regras da UE; introduzir o processo de decisão baseado na regra da maioria qualificada inversa no Conselho tanto na vertente preventiva como na vertente correctiva do quadro; reforçar a transparência e a responsabilização, com o objectivo de aumentar o apoio e a pressão dos pares; impor um papel mais independente por parte da Comissão no processo de decisão, mas também uma maior responsabilização desta instituição; e por último, a necessidade de o Parlamento desempenhar um papel reforçado no processo de supervisão, mas não um papel executivo.
As propostas da Comissão incluem a redução para seis meses do período de análise dos pedidos recebidos, bem como a redução do período de objecção para dois meses.
As propostas da Comissão relativas à melhoria da governação económica revestem-se da maior importância para o futuro da UE e para o crescimento económico, em particular na área do euro. A importância crucial destas medidas determinou que os relatores do Parlamento Europeu decidissem examinar exaustivamente as propostas da Comissão como um pacote e melhorá-las de forma a instaurar um quadro sólido e coerente para as próximas décadas.
As propostas da Comissão relativas à melhoria da governação económica revestem-se da maior importância para o futuro da União Europeia e o crescimento nos países que pertencem à área do euro. A governação económica deverá assentar numa maior apropriação nacional das normas e políticas comummente adoptadas e num quadro de fiscalização mais sólido, a nível da UE, das políticas económicas nacionais. A fim de assegurar um quadro de supervisão credível e eficaz, é necessário reforçá-lo através da aplicação de multas anuais por incumprimento das recomendações ou por não respeito da obrigação de elaborar um plano de medidas correctivas adequado.
As propostas de reforço da Frontex têm de ser adoptadas com urgência.
As propostas do relator, nomeadamente o cumprimento dos Objectivos de Desenvolvimento do Milénio (ODM), a erradicação da pobreza, a canalização de 20% dos recursos para a saúde e a formação básica, uma atenção especial às questões climáticas, uma nova abordagem no apoio aos países em desenvolvimento exigindo o respeito pelos direitos Humanos, bem como uma utilização mais eficiente e eficaz dos parcos recursos, merecem a minha concordância e, por isso, votei a favor.
As propostas falam de sanções mais severas, de coimas pelo incumprimento das recomendações, e da necessidade de estas serem aplicadas automaticamente para evitar sucumbir-se a negociatas político-partidárias.
As propostas legislativas sobre a governação, adoptadas pela Comissão em Setembro de 2010, deverão ser cuidadosamente estudadas e melhoradas pelo Parlamento dado o seu papel fundamental para o futuro da UE e, em particular, da área do euro. O reforço da governação económica deve andar a par com o reforço da legitimidade democrática das decisões tomadas, porque a governação económica não pode ser dissociada da regulação e supervisão dos mercados financeiros.
As propostas que a Comissão anunciou na quarta-feira para restringir o asilo e a política das migrações contêm uma série de disparates e algumas boas iniciativas. A referência a controlos fronteiriços nas nossas fronteiras internas dá mais provas de conveniência política do que de liderança e discernimento.
As propostas que a Comissão colocou sobre a mesa para este efeito são o critério de proporcionalidade, em que temos de analisar a gravidade da infracção, a duração da pena a que essa infracção estaria sujeita e o custo/benefício da execução desse mandado de detenção.
As propostas que apresentámos há um ano para fortalecer Schengen através de um mecanismo de avaliação e de uma coordenação reforçada da vigilância das fronteiras contribuirão para criar, em toda a União, um sentimento de disciplina e de orientação comum no sistema, e permitirão que, no futuro, os países não se sintam pressionados a tomar, sozinhos, decisões que afectam todos os signatários de Schengen.
As propostas visam aumentar a competitividade a longo prazo, melhorar e proteger o ambiente, melhorar a qualidade de vida e promover a coordenação e a comunicação. Devemos envidar todos os esforços possíveis para garantir a preservação e utilização sustentável deste recurso para que as gerações vindouras também possam explorá-lo, da mesma maneira que também devemos contribuir para a redução da poluição ambiental.
As práticas comerciais enganosas utilizadas por editores de directórios de empresas afectam principalmente as pequenas empresas e, por isso, têm consequências negativas substanciais para a sustentabilidade e o desenvolvimento das economias.
As práticas enganosas são ilegais nos termos da Directiva relativa à Publicidade Enganosa e Comparativa e da Directiva relativa às Práticas Comerciais Desleais.
As próximas perspectivas financeiras têm de se centrar no emprego e no crescimento para serem importante para os cidadãos. Consequentemente, além de uma forte política de coesão, também precisamos de políticas para o financiamento da investigação e desenvolvimento nas nossas universidades e pequenas e médias empresas.
As qualificações do pessoal são extremamente importantes e estão muito aquém do desejável neste domínio.
As questões em causa são essenciais, uma vez que se trata de melhorar o funcionamento do mercado interno através do maior envolvimento das empresas e dos consumidores.
As questões relacionadas com o capital de investimento e os recursos humanos serão provavelmente melhor respondidas se, enquanto políticos, não tentarmos avaliar todas essas questões, nem tomar todas as decisões ou definir directrizes.
As questões suscitadas pela ala esquerda desta Assembleia, em particular, prendem-se directamente com as preocupações das populações na Europa, mas também na Índia, e estas são preocupações com a sua própria situação social e económica e as perspectivas dos trabalhadores e dos que procuram trabalho, inclusivamente nos Estados-Membros da UE.
As radiofrequências servem o interesse público em domínios extremamente variados dos Estados-Membros.
As razões estratégicas - mencionaram algumas delas - falam por si. Em particular, o facto de, lamentavelmente, não estarmos a realizar quaisquer progressos no âmbito da OMC é igualmente demonstrativo da importância deste acordo de comércio livre com a Índia.
As razões invocadas estavam relacionadas com a OMC mas, como todos sabemos - a senhora deputada Lepage estava absolutamente correcta ao dizê-lo - essas razões não estão aqui em causa.
As receitas geradas por este aumento da portagem deverão ser reinvestidas em infra-estruturas de transporte, sendo pelo menos 15% reencaminhados inicialmente para projectos transeuropeus de transporte.
As recomendações da Comissão terão de garantir a coerência com todos os restantes documentos estratégicos, mas caberá ao país a primeira responsabilidade pelas propostas de solução a implementar. O reforço das competências do Parlamento Europeu, do envolvimento dos parceiros sociais e o respeito pelas práticas de contratação colectiva foram garantidos. A existência de sanções, que teríamos preferido aligeirar, mas às quais tivemos de aceder no contexto dos compromissos, é justificada por atitudes de falta de cooperação e não por incapacidade de os países atingirem os objectivos, e tem, por outro lado, um carácter gradual que é importante.
As recomendações são dirigidas, mensuráveis e talhadas à medida dos desafios mais urgentes de cada país. É claro que os debates sobre estas recomendações entre a Comissão e os EstadosMembros foram por vezes muito intensos, mas apraz-me dizer que o resultado global manteve um elevado nível de ambição.
As redes mantêm-se diariamente em contacto entre si e permitem o intercâmbio atempado de informações, criando assim as bases para uma rápida intervenção. A Comissão realiza quase diariamente reuniões com as autoridades dos Estados-Membros nos domínios da saúde pública e da segurança alimentar, a fim de discutir a evolução da situação epidemiológica, as medidas sanitárias tomadas para impedir a infecção e o tratamento a dar às pessoas contaminadas. O Sistema de Alerta Rápido e Resposta e o Sistema de Alerta Rápido para Alimentos para Consumo Humano e Animal (RASFF) revelaram ser uma base sólida para o intercâmbio de informações.
As reduções a que os britânicos já têm direito e que os neerlandeses e dinamarqueses reivindicam demonstram que o sistema está falido. É necessário torná-lo mais justo, mais transparente, ou assegurar recursos próprios para a UE. Deve ponderar-se um imposto sobre as transacções financeiras. Só então teremos um sistema justo em que os fundos vão para a UE e nós podemos realizar os nossos objectivos.
As reduções não tornaram o sistema mais justo e, pelo contrário, deram origem a uma série de novas isenções e correcções. Contudo, a alteração deste sistema não confere à UE um direito de tributação directa, uma vez que o Tratado não prevê uma tal competência para a União. Qualquer alteração do sistema de recursos directos só poderá entrar em vigor com a aprovação de todos os Estados-Membros.
As reformas estruturais destinadas a fomentar a competitividade das economias e o potencial de crescimento devem ser prioritárias na agenda política.
As regiões desta categoria devem ser elegíveis para as ajudas que são mais orientadas e dotadas de mais financiamento, para que cada região possa manter-se ao nível da média europeia, independentemente das suas deficiências estruturais, independentemente do seu atraso devido ao passado ou independentemente da sua exposição às actuais ou futuras crises.
As regiões fronteiriças, que representam 37,5% da população europeia, são de uma importância crucial para a integração e para a criação de pontes entre os cidadãos europeus. O sucesso da cooperação territorial está agora bem determinado.
As regiões mais pobres da União Europeia estão a desenvolver-se rapidamente neste momento, nomeadamente devido ao financiamento europeu.
As regras da livre circulação dos cidadãos beneficiam todos os países da União Europeia. É, pois, dever de todos os países apoiar aqueles que, num determinado momento, se vêem submetidos a uma grande pressão. Isto significa que os encargos devem ser distribuídos de forma equitativa.
As regras de origem são diferentes no Canadá e na UE, e a Comissão deve certificar-se de que os interesses e prioridades da agricultura europeia são devidamente acautelados.
As regras são feitas por homens e podem ser desfeitas.
As relações bilaterais, já existentes, de comércio e investimento são fortes e isto pode resultar no seu reforço. De acordo com o relatório conjunto de peritos da UE e do Canadá, a conclusão de um acordo económico e comercial global visa proporcionar benefícios económicos tangíveis, que resultarão da liberalização do comércio e da eliminação de entraves pautais.
As relações com o Canadá têm sido, desde há muito, proveitosas para as duas partes e, em termos comerciais, são de interesse mútuo e implicam uma boa cooperação. Apesar de o Canadá ser um país desenvolvido com um elevado nível de respeito pelos direitos sociais e os mais altos padrões ambientais, a Comissão - antes mesmo do Parlamento - fixou uma base para negociações com os seus interlocutores canadianos que aborda em pormenor muitas questões que é necessário alterar para que fiquemos satisfeitos.
As relações comerciais entre a UE e o Japão são, não só importantes, mas também fundamentais para as economias respectivas (em 2009, representaram mais de um quarto do PIB mundial e mais de 20% do comércio mundial). Além disso, a UE é o terceiro maior parceiro comercial do Japão. Pelo exposto, aprovo o presente relatório, embora concorde com o relator no que respeita à necessidade de a UE exigir que o Japão, entre outros aspectos, remova as barreiras não pautais e os obstáculos no acesso aos concursos públicos antes de iniciadas as negociações. Entendo ainda que o PE deve dar um sinal positivo na sequência do tsunami que devastou parte da costa japonesa com enormes perdas de vidas e de bens (já para não falar da central nuclear de Fukushima).
As relações comerciais entre a União Europeia e o Canadá podem transcender os compromissos assumidos no âmbito da Organização Mundial do Comércio, contanto que assentem num acordo equilibrado, na garantia de um acesso verdadeiramente recíproco ao mercado, e na melhoria da protecção das marcas registadas, das patentes e das indicações geográficas.
As relações comerciais têm registado significativos avanços, não havendo, no entanto, ainda um acordo global.
As relações entre a Polónia e a Alemanha estão perpetuamente a melhorar, e um exemplo disso é o crescimento do comércio entre os dois países.
As relações entre as instituições e os responsáveis políticos europeus, por um lado, e a sociedade civil, os cidadãos e as associações representativas, por outro lado, são enquadradas e incentivadas pelo Tratado da União Europeia.
As resoluções e apelos sucessivos não foram eficazes. O regime prepotente de Alexander Lukashenko amordaça a oposição, condena os seus líderes e envia-os para prisões designadas "colónias penais”. Neste contexto, basta mencionar os nomes dos candidatos presidenciais da oposição Andrei Sannikau, que começou a ser julgado há um mês, e Mikalai Statkevich, que se encontra detido pelo KGB.
As responsabilidades e os encargos não devem recair apenas num único grupo de países europeus.
As respostas políticas da UE e os instrumentos orçamentais da UE devem avançar com firmeza contra essa lógica.
As rodas já deveriam ter sido postas em movimento, caso contrário o acordo arrisca-se a ser demasiado desequilibrado.
As soluções previstas no "Small Business Act", incluindo uma redução dos obstáculos burocráticos, um melhor acesso às fontes de financiamento e um acesso mais fácil ao mercado, são especialmente significativas e, em minha opinião, medidas eficazes destinadas a criar as melhores condições possíveis para o desenvolvimento das PME.
As suas eleições não são justas.
As suas vantagens são óbvias: representam um contributo significativo para uma melhor legislação. Contudo, as avaliações de impacto não se substituem, de forma alguma, ao processo de decisão democrático da autoridade legislativa. O relatório hoje adoptado salienta a convicção do Parlamento de que as avaliações de impacto utilizadas pelas instituições europeias devem ser totalmente independentes e transparentes.
As sublevações no norte de África e no mundo árabe colocam grandes desafios à Europa, mas também oportunidades que não podemos desperdiçar. A nossa acção deve pautar-se por dois princípios. O primeiro é que na Europa sabemos bem como o caminho para a liberdade pode ser longo e penoso. O nosso caminho para as democracias liberais do século XX foi muito lento. A própria União Europeia nasceu das cinzas dos conflitos que nos recordam como a vida pode ser horrenda quando a democracia fracassa.
As subvenções agrícolas, o maior e mais controverso factor orçamental, devem ser renacionalizadas.
As suspeitas de que as autoridades egípcias fecharam os olhos ou até mesmo encorajaram a violência religiosa devem ser desfeitas mediante um compromisso firme de que a comunidade cristã estará segura no Egipto. A UE deve pedir explicações às autoridades egípcias e deixar claro que a continuação da violência será seguida da cessação da ajuda financeira e humanitária por parte da Europa.
As trabalhadoras migrantes são de facto muito vulneráveis.
As transferências ilícitas de resíduos e a má qualidade da reciclagem conduzem também a uma perda de recursos, uma vez que as matérias-primas secundárias podem contribuir em larga medida para satisfazer as necessidades de matérias-primas da Europa e podem também melhorar a eficácia e a utilização dos recursos.
As três agências de notação de crédito existentes e que operam em todo o mundo controlam 95% da totalidade das transacções. Detêm um designado monopólio de 40% do rendimento sobre o volume de negócios, pelo que proponho a criação de uma agência de notação de crédito europeia.
As unidades de medida são indispensáveis para qualquer instrumento de medição, para a expressão de qualquer medição efectuada e para a expressão de qualquer indicação de grandeza.
As unidades de medida são utilizadas na maior parte dos domínios da actividade humana. É, pois, necessário assegurar a maior clareza possível na sua utilização e regulamentar o seu uso na União no circuito económico, nos domínios da saúde e da segurança públicas, bem como nas operações de natureza administrativa.
As universidades europeias ganharão competitividade se estiverem ainda mais atentas às necessidades do mercado e da economia, e se encontrarem fontes de financiamento suplementares.
As verbas remanescentes não devem ser desviadas da investigação e utilizadas para outros programas ou instrumentos que não se enquadrem no âmbito do sector da investigação e inovação e nos objectivos e metas do PQ7. É necessário reforçar, estimular e garantir o financiamento da investigação e desenvolvimento na União Europeia mediante um aumento significativo das respectivas despesas a partir de 2013, porque esse aumento do financiamento, que em condições ideais se deveria cifrar num aumento do orçamento, deve promover o crescimento sustentável e a concorrência pela via da excelência.
As verdadeiras perspectivas financeiras têm de olhar para além destes sete anos.
As violações das normas laborais por países terceiros também contribuem para direitos aduaneiros excessivamente elevados nos países desenvolvidos e no mercado único da União Europeia, por isso não podemos deixar de seguir as condições da OIT se quisermos ser competitivos. A União Europeia não deve apontar o dedo nesta matéria, mas sim apresentar os seus próprios compromissos e soluções para melhorar a situação.
As vítimas estão à espera de resultados práticos e espero que a Comissão tome as medidas necessárias para acabar com esta situação.
As áreas domínios de investigação devem ser coerentes e semelhantes.
As únicas pessoas que os deputados devem representar são o seu eleitorado e não os interesses económicos ou religiosos.
Assegurar a sobrevivência de um sistema de energia condenado não será forma de ajudar os pescadores; a ser assim, eles próprios acabarão também por ficar condenados.
Assegurar uma transição pacífica para a independência do Sudão do Sul implica também que a luta contra a impunidade continue no topo da agenda da UE para ambos os países e para os seus vizinhos em vão envolvidos na questão. A UE não devia cair na tentação de estabelecer "compromissos" potencialmente "convenientes" com o Presidente al-Bashir, a troco do esquecimento da necessidade de ele e os seus capangas serem levados ao Tribunal Penal Internacional (TPI) para responderem pelos crimes de guerra e pelos crimes contra a humanidade perpetrados contra o povo sudanês em Darfur.
Assenta, assim, na confiança recíproca nos sistemas de certificação em vigor, quer na UE, quer no Canadá, prevendo obrigações e métodos de cooperação de forma a que a autoridade importadora possa emitir o seu próprio certificado de produto, componente ou equipamento aeronáutico sem ter de repetir todas as avaliações efectuadas pela autoridade exportadora.
Assim a ajuda ao desenvolvimento deverá financiar projectos destinados a erradicar as causas profundas da migração (o combate à pobreza), não devendo ser usada para reforçar o controlo fronteiriço ou o combate à imigração ilegal.
Assim como o euro, a livre circulação de pessoas na UE constitui um dos pilares fundamentais do projecto europeu. Não existe agora qualquer razão para o questionarmos. A reacção aos milhares de refugiados que estão a ser literalmente atirados para o sul da Europa talvez não possa ser considerada uma razão válida para começarmos a fechar as nossas fronteiras internas, mesmo temporariamente. A única forma sensata de reagir a este facto é fazer alguma coisa, a curto prazo, a favor duma política europeia comum de asilo e migração. Não podemos e não devemos cruzar os braços e permitir a chegada de 30 000 refugiados às costas de Itália ou da Grécia para minarem os pilares da EU. A Itália teve obviamente razão ao pedir a solidariedade da Europa para resolver este problema. A solidariedade é a solução. Fechar as nossas fronteiras, mesmo temporariamente, é uma reacção de pânico, imprópria de líderes da UE.
Assim que os resíduos nucleares estejam fora das fronteiras europeias, deixamos de poder controlar a forma como serão geridos.
Assim sendo, a juventude tem um papel fundamental a desempenhar na realização dos cinco grandes objectivos da UE para 2020: emprego, investigação e inovação, clima e energia, educação e combate à pobreza.
Assim sendo, a primeira coisa a fazer é lidar com isso. É absolutamente claro que o Conselho reúne actualmente uma maioria de Ministros dos Transportes que não têm preocupações com questões do foro ambiental. É igualmente claro que há uma maioria no Conselho que não se preocupa com aqueles que vivem e trabalham na estrada, uma maioria que apoia um sistema em que os consumidores compram seja o que for, que venha de longe, em vez de produtos regionais de alta qualidade.
Assim sendo, coerência, credibilidade e a ambiciosa estratégia Europa 2020 são, pois, elementos determinantes e fundamentais para assegurar no seio da União Europeia a estabilidade de que hoje precisamos, inclusive em relação à nossa moeda única.
Assim sendo, concordo com a necessidade de se desenvolverem instrumentos de apoio à "aprendizagem ao longo da vida” ou, por outras palavras, à melhoria constante das qualificações. Só programas de educação criativos e eficazes tornarão possível que pelo menos 40% das pessoas completem o ensino superior, o que constitui um dos objectivos prioritários da Estratégia "Europa 2020”.
Assim sendo, considero que a protecção das florestas na UE tem de ser orientada para o objectivo de garantir que as florestas satisfaçam, no presente e também no futuro, as suas funções produtivas, socioeconómicas e ecológicas.
Assim sendo, em todas as instituições financeiras, deve ser criado um sistema de governo eficaz e adequado em termos de gestão de riscos, cumprimento das normas, funções de auditoria interna (e, no caso das seguradoras, funções actuariais), estratégias e políticas, bem como processos e procedimentos.
Assim sendo, este documento devia ocupar-se também da questão da execução e salvaguarda da política externa e dos instrumentos da UE. Além disso, o Conselho devia incluir também no relatório avaliações da coordenação e coerência existentes entre a PESC e outras políticas externas da União, bem como recomendações estratégicas e organizativas para o futuro com base na avaliação de acções da PESC.
Assim sendo, ficaríamos gratos se voltasse a debruçar-se sobre a situação contribuindo para a sua resolução.
Assim sendo, julgo que os obstáculos relacionados com o sistema, bem como os obstáculos em termos de atitude e impeditivos de integração, precisam de ser removidos para que os europeus aprendam a fazer progressos nos domínios das suas competências e valores, dando um efectivo contributo para a consecução dos objectivos da estratégia Europa 2020.
Assim sendo, não estou de acordo com as propostas daqueles que prefeririam limitar o alcance deste instrumento, de modo que este se aplicasse apenas aos contratos de comércio electrónico, pois entendo que tal iria criar uma diferenciação artificial, e sobretudo desnecessária, entre as transacções em linha e presenciais.
Assim sendo, não posso estar de acordo com a aprovação do princípio do poluidor-pagador, pois esta situação vai prejudicar enormemente os industriais do sector do transporte de mercadorias dos países periféricos, nomeadamente de Portugal, em detrimento dos países mais ricos da Europa Central e do Norte.
Assim sendo, tem de reforçar o seu papel em todas as organizações multilaterais, com principal destaque para a ONU, onde o seu papel tem de ser cada vez mais activo, no seguimento do início da actividade do Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa (SEAE).
Assim sendo, tem que reforçar o seu papel em todas as organizações multilaterais, com principal destaque para a ONU onde o seu papel tem que ser cada vez mais activo, no seguimento do início da actividade do Serviço Europeu da Acção Externa (SEAE). Tendo em consideração que as parcerias globais são determinantes para a consecução de objectivos globais definidos conjuntamente, que a UE é o maior doador mundial de ajuda ao desenvolvimento e um parceiro importante das Nações Unidas nos esforços desenvolvidos no âmbito dos seus três pilares de intervenção, inclusive em situações de crise e de pós-crise, e que as contribuições dos Estados-Membros representam 38% do orçamento regular da ONU, concluímos que uma parceria UE-ONU sólida e estável é fundamental para o trabalho das Nações Unidas e decisiva para o papel da UE como actor mundial.
Assim sendo, temos de o resolver a nível europeu. A presente crise oferece ainda oportunidade de dizer claramente aos cidadãos europeus que a Europa não deixará desamparadas as vítimas de um desastre de saúde pública desta dimensão.
Assim sendo, é muito importante que nestas negociações não fiquem esquecidos o recurso ao trabalho infantil e o incumprimento de normas sociais e ambientais internacionais, o que constitui uma forma de dumping prejudicial para as empresas e os trabalhadores europeus. É assim essencial que a Comissão esclareça estes pontos antes de concluir um acordo comercial.
Assim sendo, é uma boa oportunidade para acrescentarmos melhorias ao acordo agora existente.
Assim, Senhor Comissário, precisamos de levar a cabo investigações exaustivas, numa perspectiva de longo prazo, e precisamos de colher lições e de as integrar nas nossas políticas.
Assim, a Agenda Digital, a economia digital e este primeiro programa político de 5 anos visam estimular a nossa economia e tornar o mercado interno real para todas os componentes que a integram.
Assim, a Agenda Digital, a economia digital e este primeiro programa político de 5 anos, agora aprovados, são essenciais para o desenvolvimento da economia e contribuem para o desenvolvimento do mercado interno. O objectivo é a reconquista da liderança global para a indústria de telecomunicações europeia e o incremento da produtividade, coesão, competitividade e acesso a um mercado único.
Assim, a Comissão da Cultura e da Educação preocupou-se especialmente que ficasse claro que o espectro é, e continuará a ser, essencial para a concretização de uma vasta gama de funções societais, culturais e sociais.
Assim, a Comissão dos Transportes e do Turismo resolveu propor este relatório de iniciativa com o objectivo de definir alguns princípios gerais sobre o modo como os acordos sobre transportes aéreos devem ser avaliados em termos de substância e dos procedimentos que a comissão pode adoptar para se manter devidamente informada ao longo das negociações e para ter a oportunidade de expressar as suas prioridades muito antes de ser confrontada com a decisão final de aprovação ou rejeição. Os novos poderes parlamentares previstos no Tratado de Lisboa criam uma nova responsabilidade de assegurar que o Parlamento e a sua comissão competente estejam devidamente informados sobre a preparação dos acordos que mais tarde serão chamados a aprovar. A esta obrigação corresponde uma responsabilidade de controlo mais próximo da condução das negociações. É assim necessário ter estes pressupostos em conta aquando das futuras negociações de acordos internacionais.
Assim, a abordagem de lista negativa em nada prejudica a capacidade de um Estado-Membro da UE continuar a manter o direito de reter um monopólio, no futuro, para um determinado serviço.
Assim, a aplicação a dar a este dinheiro seria na área das infraestruturas e sua melhoria e na investigação sobre veículos mais limpos.
Assim, a energia nuclear, como uma tecnologia com baixas emissões de CO2, não pode ser ignorada. O desafio reside em conseguir um equilíbrio entre o desenvolvimento da energia nuclear e o desenvolvimento de instrumentos destinados a prevenir os riscos associados à sua produção e a combater os efeitos dos acidentes nucleares.
Assim, a pressão passou para as fronteiras internas, e assim as fronteiras externas constituem uma preocupação conjunta.
Assim, a redacção deverá ser a seguinte: "O Parlamento Europeu nota que a opção de usufruir de uma pensão reduzida a partir dos 50 anos de idade e a opção de receber um montante fixo equivalente a 25% dos direitos de pensão foram abolidas". A redacção deverá ser a seguinte: "A idade de aposentação aumentou de 60 para 63 anos de idade". A redacção deverá ser a seguinte: "Os gestores do Fundo foram instados a adoptar ...".
Assim, a reforma do Fundo Monetário Internacional e do Banco Mundial constitui uma prioridade absoluta.
Assim, acredito na eficácia do registo em matéria de transparência e dos algoritmos da impressão digital, que, longe de limitar e fazer medo, constituem uma oportunidade para melhorar as nossas informações e avaliar os nossos resultados.
Assim, alguns aspectos da resolução merecem o nosso acordo, designadamente a crítica à falta de transparência existente no tocante à composição e aos trabalhos do grupo consultivo dos serviços internos da Comissão que se dedica aos processos de adjudicação de contratos públicos (ACPP) e ao papel e competências do Comité Consultivo para os Contratos de Direito Público (CCO). Assim como a defesa de uma composição equilibrada, que inclua os sindicatos e representantes das empresas, nomeadamente das PME, e uma maior transparência, tanto daquele comité, como do comité consultivo que a Comissão pretende instituir para tratar das parcerias público-privadas.
Assim, apelo tanto à Comissão Europeia como aos Estados-Membros para que prestem a máxima atenção ao empreendedorismo jovem e à promoção de uma utilização eficiente dos recursos e a outras iniciativas de poupança de energia.
Assim, as condições são: 20% para a Europa isoladamente e 30% se tivermos parceiros, ou seja: se os EUA ou a China se juntarem a nós. Considero que se trata de uma proposta séria, justa e de grande alcance.
Assim, as sinergias entre o PQ7 e os Fundos Estruturais e de Coesão devem ser revistas, o que, por sua vez, poderá promover o desenvolvimento de infra-estruturas que têm sido descuradas.
Assim, até a cláusula de revisão desta Directiva é uma questão de senso comum.
Assim, como todas as políticas europeias, a cooperação no espaço Schengen deveria reflectir a situação real à qual se aplica hoje, e que é diferente da de há 10 anos atrás. É este o contexto em que devem ser entendidas as propostas dos governos italiano e francês, bem como as medidas pragmáticas e necessárias referidas hoje pela Comissão na sua comunicação sobre a imigração. Com efeito, a confiança mútua entre os Estados-Membros que integram o espaço Schengen é a pedra angular da cooperação de Schengen.
Assim, concordo com a proposta da relatora no sentido de reforçar o objectivo Cooperação Territorial através de um aumento de 2,5% para 7% do orçamento global, bem como de adopção de medidas de simplificação na execução dos programas e na criação de agrupamentos europeus de cooperação territorial (AECT) imprescindíveis ao funcionamento de sistemas de governação transfronteiriça.
Assim, concordo com a recomendação do relator de que as comissões conjuntas devem considerar-se, em termos regimentais, comissão competente.
Assim, concordo com o relator, o senhor deputado Hökmark, quando diz que temos absolutamente de cumprir o calendário que tínhamos definido para a libertação do espectro.
Assim, congratulo-me com a aprovação desta proposta e espero que, brevemente, os Estados-Membros possam aumentar os apoios aos pescadores e que a União Europeia, através do Fundo Europeu das Pescas (FEP), aumente as taxas de comparticipação destinadas à melhoria e modernização das embarcações e equipamentos e proceda à criação de um Fundo a que as PME possam recorrer em caso de dificuldade. É particularmente importante o apoio aos pescadores artesanais.
Assim, congratulo-me com a aprovação deste relatório que representa um grande avanço na protecção dos consumidores e saúdo a opção tomada pelo Conselho de restringir esta directiva às vendas porta-a-porta e via internet - um mercado em grande expansão mas no qual os consumidores ainda se sentem um pouco perdidos - e louvo as medidas de simplificação adoptadas, nomeadamente a possibilidade de rescisão de contrato via telefone por parte dos consumidores (não da parte das empresas). Na realidade, o mercado comum precisa de regras mais precisas e transparentes como é o caso da cláusula sobre a obrigatoriedade de informações sobre os mecanismos de transacção na internet.
Assim, congratulo-me com a aprovação do projecto de acordo sobre a criação de um Registo de Transparência, certo de que constitui um avanço significativo na transparência das instituições europeias e contribuirá para a consolidação do Projecto Europeu junto dos cidadãos.
Assim, congratulo-me com o consenso obtido e voto favoravelmente este regulamento, que revoga a Directiva 73/44/CEE do Conselho, a Directiva 96/73/CE do PE e do Conselho e a Directiva 2008/121/CE do PE e do Conselho.
Assim, considero benéfico o lançamento de programas específicos de formação profissional, centrados na inovação e na promoção da criatividade, aspectos que podem ser estimulados, ensinados e reforçados em diferentes fases do processo de formação. A Comissão Europeia tem de incentivar e apoiar os Estados-Membros para que alarguem a inclusão, enquanto componentes dos sistemas de ensino nacionais, de elementos como a inovação e a criatividade, e para que fomentem a melhoria da cooperação entre os sistemas de ensino e o mundo empresarial, através do desenvolvimento de novos programas de estudo e de programas de doutoramento, incluindo ao nível transfronteiras.
Assim, considero o relatório apresentado pelo relator muito importante, e penso que os processos que descreveu permitirão modificar o aparelho utilizado na avaliação dos produtos financeiros para que as conclusões apresentadas, tanto pelas agências de notação como por outros mecanismos, levem a notações mais objectivas dos produtos financeiros.
Assim, convido a Comissão a mobilizar os recursos dos fundos do Quadro Estratégico Comum de Financiamento para o financiamento destes sectores, em especial os da investigação e da inovação da União Europeia.
Assim, dada a natureza destes esquemas fraudulentos, incluindo o seu carácter transfronteiriço e à escala europeia, está a Comissão disposta a introduzir alguma forma de apoio jurídico para ajudar as PME a fazer face a estes esquemas? Este tipo de fraudes vai continuar enquanto a Comissão não tomar medidas severas.
Assim, do que precisamos é de abertura às reformas e de coragem política.
Assim, e na esperança de que os peritos encontrem rapidamente uma solução, requeiro que hoje a Comissão, quando se dirigir ao Conselho, exija medidas de reparação imediatas, do âmbito económico mas também moral, destinadas aos produtores da Andaluzia e de toda a Europa, que olham para nós com indignação mas, ao mesmo tempo, com esperança.
Assim, em articulação com a Comissão, decidiu criar um registo comum para inscrever e controlar as pessoas e as organizações que, de alguma maneira, tenham influência na elaboração e/ou implementação das políticas da União Europeia (UE). Na verdade, a transparência é essencial no funcionamento das instituições europeias, acusadas, muitas vezes, da sua falta.
Assim, em nossa opinião, nenhuma parte interessada, seja ela qual for, pode reivindicar qualquer espécie de direito de preferência, de direito adquirido, sobre o espectro, e penso que este relatório o afirma muito claramente.
Assim, em vez de avançar com um Pacto de Progresso e Desenvolvimento Social assente na solidariedade e em verdadeiras políticas de coesão económica e social, insiste no aprofundamento do PEC e do Pacto para o Euro. E amplia a aplicação de sanções e o pagamento de multas para os Estados que não cumpram as exigências que lhes forem impostas.
Assim, embora me congratule com o apelo da resolução para a introdução de um mecanismo de coordenação que tem ainda um maior impacto, exorto-vos também a alterar as regras relativas à transferência do dinheiro dos fundos, tornando-as tão flexíveis quanto possível.
Assim, estamos prontos para negociar a nossa contribuição e, como disse no meu discurso introdutório, penso que vamos afirmar essa intenção numa declaração política a publicar em Junho. O que não quer dizer que aceitemos o acordo interinstitucional.
Assim, este é um caminho que não irá estrangular os Estados-Membros, antes abrirá novas alternativas para todos nós. É por isso que acredito que o senhor deputado Verhofstadt tem razão quando refere que temos, evidentemente, de estar preparados para assumir iniciativas conjuntas como a criação do Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa, realizando, ao mesmo tempo, economias a nível nacional.
Assim, este é um relatório sem dúvida ambicioso, dadas as matérias que nele são reflectidas, desde a protecção dos direitos de propriedade intelectual a uma maior cooperação entre Estados-Membros e Comissão. Deste modo, felicito a relatora pelo compromisso e espero que, com mais este contributo, possamos alcançar todos os objectivos propostos na Estratégia UE 2020.
Assim, estou firmemente convencido de que para reduzirmos as emissões de gases com efeito de estufa temos, sim, de ser mais consistentes na promoção da inovação na área das novas tecnologias verdes, e não abordar a necessidade de proteger a qualidade do ar exclusivamente por meio de instrumentos administrativos e financeiros, mas antes pela via do apoio à investigação e à adopção das novas tecnologias na vida real.
Assim, eu gostaria de pedir à UE, ao Parlamento Europeu, à Comissão e ao Conselho que se empenhem mais no apoio aos EstadosMembros, e que façam mais pressão no sentido de eles investirem nessa área, porque investir na investigação, inovação e educação é o único modo de atingirmos efectivamente os objectivos da Europa 2020.
Assim, exacerbámos a crise com ainda mais integração e todas as coisas que ouvimos no debate de ontem sobre este relatório - "precisamos de união fiscal", "precisamos de governação económica". Podem ver, meus amigos, o vício dessa lógica. A integração europeia falhou, então aumentemos a integração! A união monetária não é suficiente, precisamos de união económica.
Assim, face à dureza da agenda prevista para o Conselho de 24 de Junho, espero que o espírito de liderança revelado pela Comissão e pelas instituições europeias consiga convencer os governos nacionais a colocarem os nossos ideais à frente dos nossos interesses, sejam eles quais forem.
Assim, faço apelo ao Senhor Presidente para que mostre alguma determinação no Conselho "Assuntos Económicos e Financeiros" (Ecofin) da próxima semana.
Assim, gostaria de instar a Comissão a elaborar um calendário com prazos mais curtos.
Assim, gostaria de instar os Estados-Membros e a Comissão Europeia a promoverem o ensino artístico e cultural para todos os grupos etários, do ensino primário até ao superior ou profissional, assim como as competências empresariais dos profissionais do sector da cultura, incluindo no contexto da aprendizagem ao longo da vida. A fim de permitir o funcionamento destas indústrias, é igualmente essencial melhorar o acesso ao financiamento para os profissionais deste sector: criar microcréditos, desenvolver o mecenato e as parcerias público-privadas, considerar o lançamento de instrumentos de financiamento novos e inovadores, e formar profissionais do sector bancário nas características específicas destes sectores.
Assim, gostaria de saber o que se passa com esses programas - pelo menos, ao que a Comissão saiba -, tendo em conta que eles estão a chegar ao seu termo e que o assunto já devia ter sido abordado na Comissão da Cultura e da Educação. Como pensa a Comissão desenvolver o próximo programa, a executar a partir de 2014? Julgo que esta questão se reveste de particular interesse para muita gente que participa activamente na vida da União Europeia e para muitos jovens dos nossos países.
Assim, gostaria de vos recordar que a proposta no sentido de o procedimento invocar a base jurídica do artigo 70.º, que exclui o Parlamento, é inaceitável: exigimos o artigo 77.º.
Assim, importa clarificar que a cooperação para o desenvolvimento é o único domínio da acção externa que não foi concebido para servir os interesses da União Europeia, mas sim para defender os interesses das populações mais marginalizadas e vulneráveis do planeta: mitigação da pobreza e desenvolvimento humano, social e económico sustentável - em suma, assegurar a concretização do direito de todos a uma vida digna.
Assim, insiste no pagamento de multas para os Estados que não cumpram as exigências que lhes forem impostas pelo PEC reforçado, embora, para dar cobertura ao sistema de sanções, procure também incluir um sistema de incentivos.
Assim, lamentamos o facto de, apesar das tentativas que o relator fez e continua a fazer, o relatório ser omisso quanto a estes dois aspectos.
Assim, neste momento posso partilhar convosco a opinião da Presidência húngara. E permitam-me reiterar, não pela primeira vez neste Hemiciclo, que a nossa filosofia de base é a de uma Europa forte; uma Europa forte que coloca as pessoas no centro das suas preocupações.
Assim, no que toca à reintrodução das fronteiras internas, pensamos que isso só pode ser feito numa situação excepcional, em caso de desafio extraordinário, por um período definido e por decisão da Comunidade.
Assim, não podemos providenciar uma solução a curto prazo, circunstancial, aumentando subsídios a par das flutuações do preço do petróleo. É uma questão de lógica política. A União Europeia deve manter-se firme com vista aos princípios e objectivos que ela própria estabeleceu, nomeadamente combatendo o aquecimento global como matéria prioritária e reduzindo as emissões de gases de estufa resultantes dos combustíveis fósseis.
Assim, o Parlamento Europeu, ciente do papel crucial da cultura na sociedade europeia, fez um apelo claro no sentido do reforço do apoio aos agentes culturais.
Assim, o acordo não levará à introdução da etiquetagem de origem obrigatória. Não poderei votar a favor de uma regulamentação que passe a obrigar as empresas a fornecer a etiqueta do país de origem.
Assim, o nível das dotações de pagamento, tal como proposto pela Comissão Europeia, deve ser mantido, tendo em conta a necessidade de que todos os programas devem prosseguir com celeridade.
Assim, oponho-me à alteração que modifica o n.º 3 do artigo 7.º, o qual se debruça sobre as necessidades em matéria de radiofrequências das políticas específicas da União e utiliza as frequências civis para fins militares.
Assim, para concluir, gostaria de agradecer aos relatores-sombra e também ao Eurostat, que terá subsequentemente de levar a cabo o trabalho que há a fazer.
Assim, perguntar-lhe-ia, Senhor Presidente Barroso, se a Comissão está preparada para debater connosco formas de mitigar a situação de subfinanciamento da rede de protecção social - dos sistemas de segurança social - nos Estados-Membros da União Europeia, em particular nos que foram mais severamente atingidos pela crise orçamental.
Assim, pergunto à Comissão que medidas tenciona tomar em defesa do mercado hortofrutícola e que novas medidas tenciona igualmente tomar para evitar a divulgação de informações pouco fiáveis acerca das origens da bactéria EHEC, que está a prejudicar todo o sector hortofrutícola e a lançar o pânico entre as populações. Estamos a falar de alimentos de qualidade!
Assim, podemos voltar a mostrar que a EU está empenhada na transparência não só em palavras, mas também em actos.
Assim, porque escapam às estruturas formais de actividade económica, não raro vêem os seus direitos enquanto trabalhadores coarctados, situação esta que tem que ser combatida de forma determinada.
Assim, posso afirmar-vos que sempre existiu um diálogo contínuo nos bastidores com vista a promover um maior conhecimento e uma maior confiança entre ambas as partes. É sobre esta confiança mútua que se edifica a maioria das nossas políticas na União Europeia e, sem ela, os Estados-Membros não conseguiriam tomar uma decisão política como esta, que requer unanimidade.
Assim, pretende-se um quadro completo que indique quando, onde, como e em que animais foram os medicamentos antimicrobianos realmente utilizados, sem criar novos encargos financeiros ou administrativos para os agricultores ou outros proprietários de animais, tendo em conta que as práticas e a intensidade da pecuária divergem consoante o Estado-Membro.
Assim, propomos um novo pacote para estes fundos que reforce a igualdade de oportunidades entre todos os nossos territórios europeus, independentemente do seu passado em termos económicos, das suas desvantagens em comparação com regiões mais desenvolvidas e do seu grau de vulnerabilidade à crise económica que estamos a viver actualmente ou a qualquer crise que possam ter de enfrentar no futuro.
Assim, propõe-se revogar as condições de recolha das provas de origem relativas a determinados têxteis e respectivas obras com origem em países terceiros. O rol de produtos abrangidos é extenso, designadamente: seda; lã, algodão; outras fibras têxteis vegetais; filamentos sintéticos ou artificiais; feltros e falsos tecidos; tapetes e outros revestimentos para pavimentos; tecidos especiais, rendas, tapeçarias, bordados; tecidos de malha ou croché; vestuário e seus acessórios.
Assim, reiteramos a oposição e as razões que a fundamentam: estamos perante a defesa, por meios diversos, incluindo militares e diplomáticos, de interesses económicos e geoestratégicos das potências europeias, em convergência com os EUA e a NATO. Não é demais lembrar a folha de serviços destas instituições e as suas consequências dramáticas: Iraque, Afeganistão, Balcãs, Líbia, com outros países também na lista.
Assim, resumindo, não estou à espera de discussões fáceis com o Conselho sobre o futuro. A experiência do processo de 2011 foi muito instrutiva.
Assim, seria desejável rever a proibição de utilização de farinhas de origem animal para não-ruminantes, em consonância com o parecer do Comité Científico Veterinário europeu. São estas as solicitações da resolução adoptada na Comissão da Agricultura e do Desenvolvimento Rural em 12 de Abril deste ano e que será votada neste Parlamento amanhã.
Assim, temos de analisar os defeitos do sistema e da sua execução, sem destruir a utilidade deste Mandado.
Assim, termino como comecei, afirmando que não nos falta ambição, que precisamos de recursos para fazer o trabalho correctamente, precisamos de ser coerentes, precisamos de desenvolver e fortalecer a nossa acção, e fá-lo-emos, mas faremos esse caminho em conjunto com os 27 Estados-Membros da União Europeia, umas vezes ocupando uma posição de liderança, outras encorajando, outras ainda trabalhando lado a lado, e o vosso apoio será inestimável nesta missão.
Assim, tudo o que pudermos fazer para mobilizar não só as instituições da UE, mas também as nossas sociedades, no sentido de ajudar a transição para a democracia dos nossos vizinhos, é muito importante, e não posso senão saudar o interesse demonstrado pelo Parlamento Europeu.
Assim, urge encontrar mecanismos e soluções que permitam a redução do risco e criar um diálogo permanente entre as autoridades de supervisão, os auditores e as instituições.
Assim, vai ser necessário produzir mais alimentos num contexto de custos de produção mais elevados, de uma enorme volatilidade dos mercados agrícolas e de uma pressão crescente sobre os recursos naturais, o que significa que os agricultores terão de produzir mais utilizando menos terras, menos água e menores quantidades de energia.
Assim, votei a favor da alteração 1 porque me oponho frontalmente a que sejam canalizados fundos da política agrícola comum para a mobilização dos recursos necessários para estes programas. O sector agrícola, também ele mergulhado em crise, precisa destes fundos para as suas próprias iniciativas no domínio da inovação. Uma Europa inovadora pode contribuir para a inovação da agricultura, para que, à semelhança de outros sectores estratégicos, este possa assegurar também o seu futuro.
Assim, votei a favor da resolução sobre a Análise do "Small Business Act”, cujo objectivo consiste em libertar o potencial de crescimento das PME. Há ainda muito a fazer para simplificar o quadro regulador e os procedimentos administrativos que oneram em demasia a actividade e o dinamismo das nossas empresas.
Assim, votei favoravelmente esta proposta de resolução comum, aprovada por larga maioria em sede da Comissão da Agricultura e do Desenvolvimento Rural, pois trata-se de um texto muito equilibrado cujas propostas não só protegem a saúde humana e defendem o bem-estar animal, mas também garantem a viabilidade das empresas.
Assim, é este um primeiro ponto para avaliação, desde que concordemos que o objectivo dos programas é ultrapassar a crise orçamental e económica, e não criar uma cultura da punição que conduza ao eurocepticismo na Europa. O segundo ponto para avaliação é o facto de, apesar dos esforços que estão a ser feitos, os mercados não estarem a responder.
Assim, é imperativo reduzir as formalidades administrativas e adoptar uma administração moderna e adaptada às necessidades das PME.
Assim, é natural que os representantes eleitos do povo controlem, em nome dos contribuintes, a boa utilização dos dinheiros dos cidadãos, de acordo com essas regras. É assim que este exercício funciona em todos os Estados democráticos.
Assim, é necessário explorar as potencialidades da era digital, implementar uma dinâmica comunitária e estimular o sector cultural, dotando estas indústrias com modelos económicos inovadores.
Assinalará mais um passo na nossa ambição de aumentar as oportunidades de mobilidade.
Assinatura dos actos adoptados em conformidade com o processo legislativo ordinário: ver Acta
Assistimos actualmente a mudanças radicais na ordem internacional; mudanças a que a União Europeia já não se pode limitar a assistir.
Associando a ajuda directa a uma variável económica poderemos levar a cabo a transição de uma Europa a 15 para uma Europa a 27 com o mínimo prejuízo para todos os envolvidos.
Associo-me ao objectivo da Convenção de providenciar o reconhecimento jurídico do trabalho doméstico como actividade profissional, alargando os direitos a todos os trabalhadores domésticos, por forma a prevenir violações e abusos e por forma a definir um quadro jurídico em que se assegure que o trabalho não se possa processar fora deste enquadramento regulamentar.
Assuma o senhor mesmo a responsabilidade pela acreditação das autoridades de fiscalização nacionais e o Parlamento Europeu dar-lhe-á o seu apoio.
Assume também uma dimensão social significativa, na medida em que promove a integração social, económica e cultural dos trabalhadores migrantes da UE e dos membros das suas famílias nos Estados-Membros de acolhimento. O acervo legislativo da UE no domínio da livre circulação de trabalhadores confere aos cidadãos o direito de circularem livremente no território da UE para efeitos de trabalho e salvaguarda os direitos sociais dos trabalhadores e dos membros das suas famílias.
Assumimos um papel muito importante de liderança na União Europeia no que diz respeito à ajuda alimentar ao desvincular a nossa ajuda alimentar ou, por outras palavras, a ajuda alimentar europeia não tem obrigatoriamente de incluir alimentos produzidos na Europa.
Assumindo aqui, na qualidade de um Comissário, uma responsabilidade que não tem, deveria ter dito: "Senhora deputada Rebecca Harms, Senhores Deputados ao Parlamento Europeu, assumi uma enorme tarefa, mas consegui apenas realizar escassos progressos". Deveria ter referido o facto de existirem grandes problemas, de os testes de stress serem puramente voluntários, de só estarem a ser realizados no papel e de, em grande medida, estarem nas mãos dos operadores, que é onde sempre estiveram.
Assunto: As alterações climáticas e o papel dos agricultores
Assunto: Futuro do Fundo Europeu de Ajustamento à Globalização (FEG)
Assunto: Produtos de peixe em conserva como parte da ajuda alimentar
Assunto: Revisão do Regulamento (CEE) nº 1612/68 relativo à livre circulação dos trabalhadores na Comunidade
Atendendo a que a PAC absorve 42% das despesas da UE, é fundamental que actuemos com toda a responsabilidade perante os nossos os cidadãos. Face a um cenário de aumento dos preços dos alimentos - de acentuado aumento dos preços dos alimentos - e de ameaças graves à segurança alimentar, a maioria das pessoas estará à espera de uma PAC claramente centrada no aumento da produtividade e da eficiência.
Atendendo a que ainda é cedo, optemos por uma abordagem séria, esta manhã, Senhora Deputada Rebecca Harms.
Atendendo a que empregam quase 14 milhões de pessoas e cresceram de forma sustentada mesmo durante a crise, continua a ser fundamental demonstrar um apoio incondicional a estas indústrias, tal é o seu contributo a nível económico e cultural. A criação do estatuto europeu do artista, a introdução de uma taxa reduzida de IVA para os bens culturais e a melhoria da distribuição dos produtos digitais legais constituem medidas adequadas e indispensáveis para manter a influência cultural da União Europeia no mundo.
Atendendo a que os produtos podem ser livremente importados, torna-se aparentemente desnecessária a comprovação da sua origem, mas subsistem dúvidas acerca da bondade desta medida facilitadora. Não posso deixar de frisar a necessidade de assegurar a qualidade dos produtos vendidos no espaço europeu e de garantir a segurança dos seus utilizadores.
Atendendo ao crescimento sem precedentes da actividade de tráfico e da economia informal, dada a prevalência da corrupção e a incapacidade de fazer face à criminalidade organizada, não há motivo para ficarmos perturbados pelo facto de a nossa adesão estar a ser bloqueada por entraves adicionais.
Atendendo ao papel fundamental que as florestas desempenham na resolução da crise climática, a gestão sustentável das florestas reveste-se da maior importância para a UE conseguir alcançar os seus objectivos climáticos. A União Europeia tem de melhorar a sua estratégia de combate aos factores que causam a deterioração das florestas, como a desflorestação descontrolada, os incêndios e a poluição atmosférica.
Atendendo ao valor acrescentado da ajuda da Comissão, e ao novo papel de coordenação da política de desenvolvimento da União e dos Estados-Membros desempenhado pela Comissão (artigo 210.º do TFUE), a quota de APD que é canalizada pelo orçamento da UE deve, no mínimo, permanecer estável. A dotação financeira anual para o novo instrumento de cooperação para o desenvolvimento deve aumentar significativamente, em termos reais, no próximo quadro financeiro plurianual (QFP).
Atendendo aos recentes acontecimentos, é tão incorrecto dizer-se que a economia europeia já está a salvo dos efeitos da crise da dívida, como alegar que a União Europeia não reagiu à crise.
Atendendo à concordância da Bulgária e da Roménia quanto aos requisitos de adesão ao espaço Schengen, demonstro a minha satisfação em relação ao alargamento do mesmo. Não obstante, considero importantes as medidas suplementares e as soluções dadas às lacunas constatadas, nomeadamente relativas aos fenómenos de imigração ilegal verificados na Bulgária, decorrente da sua posição geográfica periférica. O bom funcionamento da livre circulação de pessoas, produtos, serviços e trabalho dependerá da solidez e harmonização das políticas referentes às fronteiras externas, pois só assim é preservada a paz social e a estabilidade económica dentro da União.
Atendendo à falta de água crónica existente na China e à sua enorme procura de matérias-primas, é de esperar que o conflito mongol se agrave. A parceria com a Mongólia, que já existe há vários anos, significa que agora a UE também está afectada e deve, seguramente, redobrar os seus esforços no que diz respeito aos direitos humanos e aos direitos das minorias.
Atendendo às controvérsias que surgem hoje em dia em torno da energia nuclear e ao facto de o sistema institucional da UE ter mudado desde a entrada em vigor do Tratado de Lisboa, penso que o Parlamento Europeu deve ser incluído no processo de decisão, no domínio da energia nuclear.
Atenta a dependência generalizada das importações, os Estados-Membros sentem uma necessidade comum de procurar formas inteligentes e sustentáveis para a utilização dos recursos e matérias-primas, necessários para a produção de energia, bem como para a indústria ou a produção de alimentos. O problema do envelhecimento da população é outro dos desafios que quase todos os países da UE enfrentam.
Atente-se, por exemplo, que apenas 8 % dos consumidores fazem compras em linha a partir de outro Estado-Membro. O presente relatório, que apoiei, defende a necessidade de um Instrumento Facultativo (IF) para o direito europeu dos contratos por força de um regulamento.
Atingimos o limite das tentativas de comover os mercados com dinheiro público.
Através da cooperação, poderemos controlar a epidemia.
Através da partilha de literatura, cinema, música e património, abrem-se as portas da compreensão e constroem-se pontes entre os povos. A identidade europeia - em toda a sua diversidade - e os valores europeus manifestam-se através dessas expressões culturais.
Através da partilha de literatura, filmes, música e património, abrem-se portas de compreensão e constroem-se pontes entre os povos. A identidade europeia, em toda a sua diversidade, assim como os valores europeus, manifesta-se através dessas expressões culturais.
Através da votação de hoje, vamos sublinhar a necessidade de um instrumento separado de cooperação para o desenvolvimento que vise específica e exclusivamente os países em desenvolvimento e procure expressamente realizar os objectivos previstos no artigo 208.º do Tratado sobre o Funcionamento da União Europeia.
Através de uma aplicação simplificada e muito mais automática do procedimento de interrupção dos pagamentos, penso que assistiremos, no exercício de 2010, a um incremento da incidência da interrupção de pagamentos e a que os serviços deixem de ter receio de recorrer a este instrumento no seu trabalho.
Através de uma decisão do Parlamento e do Conselho, adoptada em 2009, criámos a possibilidade adicional de utilizar até 4% dos recursos do Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional para medidas destinadas a melhorar a eficiência energética dos edifícios para habitação. Desde então, cerca de metade dos Estados-Membros já aproveitou esta possibilidade, com a França a assumir um papel exemplar na sua utilização e aplicação.
Através desta medida, podemos finalmente expressar a nossa vontade de melhorar o trabalho das agências de notação aumentando a sua transparência, integridade, responsabilidade, independência e fiabilidade.
Através destes esquemas fraudulentos, há pessoas que se fazem passar por directórios genuínos e depois cobram às empresas - que não procuraram o serviço em primeiro lugar ou não compreenderam que havia uma despesa a pagar.
Através do Regulamento (CE) n.º 2007/2000, a União Europeia concedeu um acesso excepcional ilimitado ao mercado da UE, com isenção de direitos, à quase totalidade dos produtos originários dos países e territórios que beneficiam do Processo de Estabilização e de Associação. O objectivo principal desta medida consiste em revitalizar as economias dos Balcãs Ocidentais graças a um acesso privilegiado ao mercado da UE. Estas preferências comerciais, que actualmente se aplicam à Bósnia e Herzegovina, à Sérvia e ao Kosovo, foram concedidas por um período que deveria terminar em 31 de Dezembro de 2010, mas, por forma a não comprometer o seu processo de recuperação, mostra-se agora necessário prorrogar a sua validade até 31 de Dezembro de 2015.
Através, simplesmente, da recuperação de quantias de dinheiro que foram pagas indevidamente, conseguiríamos reduzir significativamente os encargos do orçamento.
Atribuo muita importância às acções e iniciativas que se prendem com a dimensão externa da política social da União Europeia, cujo objectivo é promover normas sociais em países terceiros a fim de evitar, entre outras coisas, a escravidão moderna, onde as pessoas são tratadas como meras "máquinas de produção", ao invés de indivíduos com valor.
Atribuímos grande importância à superação da actual crise política e dos seus efeitos económicos e sociais para a população de Madagáscar, que estão a aumentar o fardo que esta tem de suportar todos os dias.
Atrás dos debates de hoje estão meses de trabalho árduo do senhor deputado Jean-Pierre Audy, dos relatores-sombra, dos outros membros da Comissão da Indústria, da Investigação e da Energia, bem como dos membros da Comissão dos Orçamentos. A avaliação é inútil se os resultados não forem apresentados, discutidos, questionados, e aceites ou, por vezes, rejeitados pelos próprios interessados que ela pretende servir, e, evidentemente, o Parlamento desempenha um papel vital neste processo, não só contribuindo com a sua larga experiência da vida política e da vida pública, mas, o que é igualmente importante, das muitas áreas de conhecimento aprofundado de que dispõem os seus membros.
Até 30 de Setembro de 2013, a Comissão terá de elaborar um estudo para determinar se existe um nexo de causalidade entre as reacções alérgicas e as substâncias químicas ou as misturas utilizadas nos produtos têxteis.
Até a Organização Mundial de Comércio (OMC) ter revogado as restrições às importações de produtos têxteis da República Popular da China em 2008, a UE precisava realmente de um instrumento legislativo para regular o comércio com países terceiros e proteger o Mercado Interno da UE e os seus fabricantes.
Até agora, a cooperação com o Parlamento tem sido muito positiva, e estamos a contar com o apoio do Parlamento para as próximas etapas.
Até agora, a nossa política externa e de segurança comum é uma colecção de desacordos e de iniciativas mal avisadas. A recente euro-discórdia sobre a actuação na Líbia e a subsequente decisão de auto-exclusão por parte da Alemanha tornaram claro para o resto do mundo que a UE não é capaz de projectar uma verdadeira política externa e de segurança comum.
Até agora, a representação da UE e dos seus Estados-Membros em organizações internacionais tem sido fragmentada, o que tem impedido a União de falar a uma só voz na cena internacional. A UE deve tornar-se um actor mundial influente e capaz de defender a sua posição. Para o conseguir, impõe-se um reforço da coordenação no seio da UE, o que exigirá uma forte vontade política e flexibilidade por parte dos Estados-Membros no que respeita à sua representação.
Até agora, as empresas tiveram de lutar para operar não só no mercado nacional, mas também em mercados transnacionais. A fragmentação excessiva também reduziu o leque de escolha de milhões de cidadãos europeus e deixou-os menos confiantes em relação à compra de bens no exterior.
Até agora, conseguimos obter reconhecimento através da investigação e inovação, que garantiram a produção de fibras têxteis inovadoras.
Até agora, o Conselho não teve a intenção de participar plenamente no processo porque, ao contrário do Parlamento e da Comissão, pela sua natureza o Conselho não é afectado pela actividade dos representantes dos grupos de interesses.
Até agora, temo-nos concentrado demasiado na promoção da diversidade cultural através dos imigrantes muçulmanos, sem nos assegurarmos de que a nossa cultura também é reconhecida nos países do mundo islâmico. A vantagem de, como se propõe, tornar os aspectos culturais europeus uma parte mais perceptível das políticas económica, externa, de segurança e de desenvolvimento depende da forma concreta que essa alteração vier a assumir.
Até ao momento, 740 000 trabalhadores migrantes muçulmanos saíram do país em busca de segurança.
Até ao momento, apenas um grupo muito reduzido de Estados-Membros ainda não subscreveu o consenso. A sua adopção representaria um momento verdadeiramente decisivo para as pequenas e médias empresas, pelo que estamos a trabalhar nessa matéria com grande afinco e confiamos em que os senhores deputados também serão capazes de exercer uma certa pressão política e incentivar através dos canais próprios de modo a reunir a maioria necessária. Já abordámos a questão junto dos distintos representantes da Comissão dos Assuntos Jurídicos, nossos aliados em diversas ocasiões.
Até ao momento, contribuiu para a extradição de quase 12 000 traficantes de droga, pedófilos, violadores e terroristas, e evitou processos de extradição morosos. A celeridade deste instrumento foi valiosíssima, tendo em conta a facilidade de atravessar fronteiras e os aumentos da criminalidade transfronteiras.
Até ao momento, ouvimos dizer que há cada vez mais prioridades, mas menos recursos.
Até aqui uma referência incontornável, apesar de conduzir a possíveis erros de apreciação (por exemplo, a reconstrução que tem lugar no seguimento de catástrofes naturais é registada como progresso económico), o PIB por si só já não é suficiente.
Até aqui, a nível da UE, as principais iniciativas políticas em prol das contas do ambiente incluem o Sexto Programa de Acção em matéria de Ambiente, a estratégia de desenvolvimento sustentável da UE e as várias iniciativas políticas sectoriais relacionadas com o processo de Cardiff, que abrangem domínios como as alterações climáticas, os transportes sustentáveis, a natureza e a biodiversidade, a saúde e o ambiente, a utilização dos recursos naturais e a gestão de resíduos, e a dimensão internacional do desenvolvimento sustentável.
Até aqui, apenas têm sido tidos em conta os direitos de voto, sistema que garante uma maioria estrutural às nações economicamente fortes.
Até dotarmos a União dos recursos necessários para cumprir as suas ambições, seria uma ilusão acreditar que esta será capaz de retomar o rumo que os nossos cidadãos querem seguir.
Até estar pronta a proposta para a sua nova organização comum de mercados, o sector continuará praticamente sem espaço de manobra quanto ao estabelecimento de preços. As regras relativas a importações - muitas destas com origem em pesca ilegal - continuam a permitir uma competição injusta para a produção da UE: as novas obrigações de controlo exigem que as empresas mobilizem mais recursos e a crise geral não encoraja propriamente um maior consumo de produtos de qualidade. A isto deve juntar-se a tendência para a subida do preço do combustível, mais uma vez a ameaçar as companhias que haviam logrado sobreviver à crise de 2008.
Até há pouco vigoravam restrições quantitativas às importações originárias de países membros da Organização Mundial do Comércio (OMC), além de medidas de salvaguarda especiais para produtos têxteis provenientes da República Popular da China.
Até mesmo alguns dos pagamentos que aparentemente são correctos estão de facto a apoiar projectos grotescos.
Até pode dar-se o caso de a UE não ter uma grande competência neste domínio, mas, ainda assim, alguma coisa pode ser feita.
Até à data, a Comissão atribuiu 50 milhões de euros - 40 milhões de euros do nosso orçamento da ajuda humanitária e 10 milhões de euros da rubrica do orçamento destinada à protecção civil - enquanto os 27 Estados-Membros contribuíram colectivamente com 52 milhões de euros, elevando o montante total da assistência humanitária da UE aos 102 milhões de euros.
Até à data, aparentemente o direito europeu dos contratos era desnecessário, pelo que se aplica o princípio geral de que quando uma medida não é necessária deve ser suprimida.
Até à data, mais de 1 700 organizações foram credenciadas como grupos de representação de interesses no Parlamento Europeu e 3 900 na Comissão. Quando se pretende tecer comentários válidos sobre um assunto de natureza técnica, normalmente procuram-se informações junto de pessoas que estão mais bem informadas sobre essas questões. Tem sido sempre assim e continuará a sê-lo no futuro.
Aumentar a banda larga europeia aumentará a nossa competitividade. É de assinalar que a União Internacional das Telecomunicações afirma que a capacidade tem de ser aberta e de preferência harmonizada a nível global.
Aumentar-se-á assim a transparência e proporcionar-se-á informações mais completas sobre os indivíduos ou organizações que entrarem em contacto com deputados ao Parlamento Europeu a respeito de determinados assuntos de algumas propostas.
Avançar por entre quase 1 300 alterações foi um processo laborioso, mas, a longo prazo, alcançámos o nosso objectivo de lograr um importante compromisso comum com objectivos claramente definidos. O Parlamento provou ser capaz de elaborar uma tal política.
Avistei-me com familiares dos detidos e sei que não nos deixou outra opção se não a de adoptarmos sanções rigorosas como resposta, dirigidas àqueles no regime que são responsáveis pela repressão, incluindo o próprio Presidente Lukashenko.
Avistei-me ontem com o Ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Síria. O que está a acontecer na Síria é uma aspiração popular pela democracia e pelo Estado de direito - não é uma ingerência estrangeira.
Baseámo-nos em estudos realizados em todo o mundo, e o meu relatório aborda as seguintes questões: a colaboração com os pais, que é muito importante nos primeiros anos de vida; o pessoal e a qualidade exigida dos serviços e das qualificações; e a integração dos serviços de cuidados e educação na primeira infância no conjunto do sistema educativo de cada Estado-Membro.
Basicamente, isso significaria o fim da liberdade de acção diplomática dos Estados-Membros, uma vez que eles teriam de adaptar as suas posições de modo a não colidir abertamente com as de uma futura representação da União. Em consequência, os governos nacionais não teriam possibilidade de fazer valer adequadamente os seus próprios interesses nos fóruns internacionais.
Basicamente, o BCE tem seguido a prática dos países comunistas. Há claramente um conflito de interesses no seu mandato, e agora a zona do euro sofre as consequências.
Basicamente, o que isto implica é que um directório de empresa fraudulento envia um impresso em que aparentemente apenas solicita às pessoas que actualizem os seus dados pessoais de forma pormenorizada ou os dados pormenorizados da sua empresa em troca do que parece ser um registo gratuito numa listagem gratuita no directório de empresa. À primeira vista, não se nota que do preenchimento desse impresso possa resultar qualquer despesa, qualquer pagamento.
Basta pensar no lançamento e institucionalização do Semestre Europeu e no pacote de seis propostas relativas à governação económica, que foi criado no âmbito do procedimento de co-decisão e levará a uma abordagem económica basicamente nova.
Basta pensar no registo dos representantes de interesses aprovado pelo Parlamento Europeu em 1996, ou na proposta da Comissão de 2006 ao Parlamento Europeu sobre um registo único para os grupos de interesse. A aprovação do relatório Stubb-Friedrich por esta Assembleia levou à criação de um grupo de trabalho conjunto.
Basta pensar que abandonar a energia nuclear obrigará a Alemanha a usar mais combustíveis fósseis, aumentando os seus níveis de emissão de gases com efeito de estufa. É, portanto, necessário reorientar as nossas políticas ambientais para criar a convergência necessária com as nossas políticas energéticas, deixando para trás as tradicionais abordagens sectoriais.
Basta uma desvalorização dos seus activos de apenas 4,25%, para lhe destruir a base financeira. V. Ex.ª aceita as conclusões do Open Europe, ou subscreve a asserção de Jean-Claude Juncker, que há quinze dias afirmou que a situação do euro é de tal maneira grave que é obrigado a mentir em público?
Bem, o acordo alcançado com o Parlamento Europeu também se estende a este problema, uma vez que possibilita aos Estados-Membros definir as taxas de utilização de forma diferenciada em função da localização e do tempo.
Bom, que consta então do relatório? Naturalmente, pedimos à Comissão que apresente uma proposta para se avançar para um objectivo de redução de 25% a nível interno.
Bom, suponho que, de certa forma, talvez precisem realmente de Christine Lagarde, porque, além de a Grécia estar condenada à bancarrota e além de irmos a caminho da quarta operação de resgate, conforme eu avisei anteriormente nesta Assembleia, a solidez do próprio Banco Central Europeu vai muito em breve ser posta em causa.
Bruxelas, que é considerada por alguns como a Meca para os representantes dos grupos de pressão a seguir a Washington, necessita de regulamentação adequada e princípios claramente definidos de cooperação entre os decisores políticos e os representantes dos vários grupos de interesse.
Cabe agora à Comissão fazer sua a ambição do Parlamento, ao apresentar as suas propostas para o próximo quadro financeiro plurianual e ao não ficar refém das políticas orçamentais restritivas dos Estados-Membros.
Cabe primeiramente ao Conselho fazer com que os governos cheguem a acordo a pertir do momento em que conhecem as posições do Parlamento as posições dos povos da Europa. A rotulagem de produtos provenientes de animais clonados e dos seus descendentes é o mínimo que estabeleceremos. É preciso trabalho no seio dos governos e entre eles para aceitarem este mínimo.
Cabe à Comissão certificar-se de que os testes de stress sejam conduzidos de forma sólida, transparente e abrangente e tenham consequências reais.
Cabe, pois, à UE deixar algo bem claro: o sucesso da Parceria para a Modernização dependerá da disponibilidade e capacidade do Governo russo de prever um poder judiciário verdadeiramente independente e aplicar os princípios básicos do Estado de direito, transparência e reciprocidade.
Cabe-nos agora a responsabilidade de, em conjunto com o Conselho, traduzir concretamente esses ensinamentos num novo conjunto de regras e processos modernos e eficientes que habilitem a União a dar melhor resposta às expectativas dos nossos 500 milhões de cidadãos de uma forma sã e rentável.
Cabe-nos identificar claramente os nossos interesses e objectivos estratégicos para estarmos aptos a actuar de um modo eficaz. A União Europeia é o maior doador mundial de ajuda ao desenvolvimento e um parceiro importante das Nações Unidas em situações de crise e de pós-crise.
Cada Estado-Membro actua à sua maneira, porque a aprendizagem durante a primeira infância se desenvolveu dentro de determinado sistema educativo. A questão complica-se ainda mais em virtude de a idade de início da escolaridade obrigatória variar entre Estados-Membros.
Cada elo na cadeia de inovação europeia deverá ser reforçado e a política de inovação deverá concentrar-se nesses desafios. É assim que eu vejo o que a União da Inovação tem para oferecer.
Cada um dos Estados europeus deve também ter a função de defender as grandes realizações da Europa contra a distracção ou a diluição. Importa evitar a todo o custo guerras acesas nas quais as nações europeias não tenham qualquer interesse legítimo.
Cada uma das três instituições tinha as suas próprias regras, a sua própria filosofia e a sua própria independência, e não era garantido que elas fossem capazes de trabalhar todas em conjugação de esforços com vista a superar esses desafios.
Calcula-se que um acordo UE/Mercosul poderia reduzir em 30% os preços da carne bovina irlandesa, o que infligiria prejuízos que, só na Irlanda, poderiam ascender aos 500 milhões de euros. O sector agroalimentar irlandês representa 60% das exportações de empresas irlandesas, avaliadas em 8 mil milhões de euros por ano, gerando até 250 000 postos de trabalho.

Característica deste debate não é apenas o facto de um número cada vez mais significativo de pessoas criticar o orçamento, mas também o facto de os resultados terem melhorado claramente, por exemplo em matéria de política de coesão, onde foram introduzidas evidentes melhorias, ainda que tenham passado despercebidas aos críticos do orçamento europeu.
Carece cada vez mais de legitimidade democrática uma UE rebocada pela direita e pela social-democracia, que negoceia acordos comerciais de forma secreta e totalmente de costas voltadas para as soberanias dos povos e dos Estados-Membros, procurando esconder os enormes impactos económicos e sociais que estes terão, sem informar, esclarecer, debater e ter em conta a opinião dos povos.
Caro senhor deputado Saryusz-Wolski, deixe-me dizer-lhe com toda a franqueza que percebo as suas preocupações com a Parceria Oriental, mas considero que o mais importante não é criar uma competição entre o Leste e o Sul: nós necessitamos de ambos. O importante, neste momento, é auxiliar aqueles que desejam que nós os auxiliemos e fazê-lo com eficiência.
Caros Colegas conservadores e liberais, alguns de vós pretendem punir automaticamente os Estados considerados hereges pelo vosso dogma através de coimas de milhares de milhões de euros.
Caros Colegas, a questão do que está contemplado na Constituição de um país e do que é da competência dos vários níveis legislativos num Estado-Membro constitui claramente um assunto de soberania nacional.
Caros Colegas, como podem verificar, estamos a assistir a uma discussão fundamental sobre o futuro da Europa e aguardamos a posição da Comissão.
Caros Colegas, esta manhã, os membros do Grupo PPE apelam a uma visão ambiciosa da Europa.
Caros Colegas, nos termos do nosso Regimento e da nossa prática, permitir, ou não votações nominais é sempre da competência do Presidente. O Presidente pode conceder uma votação nominal, se entender que não perturba a sessão ou, por exemplo, no caso de haver muitos pedidos, pode perguntar à Assembleia. Não há uma regra específica num sentido ou noutro. Só quero esclarecer esta questão perante todos, para que não se abra um precedente neste hemiciclo quando não havia intenção de o fazer.
Caros colegas, a Bulgária e a Roménia concluíram o seu trabalho e estão a desenvolver estes sistemas de segurança em cooperação com os seus parceiros Schengen.
Caros colegas, gostaria de vos agradecer a vossa atenção e solidariedade, pelas quais as nações dos países bálticos ansiaram durante tantos anos.
Caso contrário, como Oscar Wilde bem define o cínico, chegaremos a uma posição onde sabemos "o preço de tudo e o valor de nada".
Caso contrário, o Tratado de Trianon passará a representar algo de negativo para todos nós.
Caso contrário, seremos ultrapassados pelas companhias extra-europeias, que estão a preparar-se para um futuro feito de automóveis mais inteligentes e modos mistos de transporte. Nós, enquanto políticos, devíamos fazer o mesmo.
Caso contrário, teremos de nos continuar a debater com a permanente falta de coordenação dos interesses dos Estados-Membros no panorama internacional.
Caso esta proposta não tivesse sido aprovada, a situação iria efectivamente agravar-se. Hoje conseguimos evitar o risco de os agricultores se verem numa situação em que, devido ao difícil clima económico, teriam de manter tractores antigos muito mais poluentes durante mais tempo do que o necessário.
Cattenom fica no percurso de aproximação ao aeroporto do Luxemburgo, e são precisamente as consequências da queda de um avião em Cattenom que não estão a ser investigadas.
Centenas de pessoas foram mortas na disputada região de Abyei entre o Sudão do Norte e o Sudão do Sul. A ONU anunciou recentemente que pelo menos 20 000 pessoas abandonaram a cidade de Abyei, fugindo para o Sul, na sequência da retirada do exército do Sudão do Norte da região. Como muito justamente afirma a resolução comum, cumpre que as duas Partes apresentem planos concretos visando a criação e/ou a reforma das suas instituições para que os dois Estados sejam completamente independentes, para cessarem as hostilidades e promoverem a governação democrática a fim de estabelecerem uma paz duradoura e a segurança na região.
Cerca de 40 cidadãos que tinham participado nas manifestações após as eleições foram acusados de perturbar a ordem pública, o que pode significar uma pena máxima de 15 anos de prisão. O poder antidemocrático na Bielorrússia encontra-se muito concentrado no seu Presidente.
Cerca de 400 000 crianças nascem prematuramente todos os anos, porém não existe financiamento para a investigação neste domínio. O parto prematuro é a primeira causa de mortalidade infantil, e os bebés prematuros têm muito maior probabilidade de desenvolver doenças crónicas.
Cerca de 73% da população europeia total vive em zonas urbanas, as quais geram 80% do produto interno bruto (PIB) e consomem até 70% da energia na Europa. O seu desenvolvimento está, portanto, directamente relacionado com domínios como o emprego, a inclusão social, a protecção ambiental e a realização, em geral, dos objectivos da política de coesão. O argumento apresentado pelo deputado Vlasák em relação a esta questão central do relançamento da política urbana como plataforma para o desenvolvimento da estratégia Europa 2020 é inteiramente aceitável, embora importe não esquecer as zonas rurais e periurbanas.
Cerca de um terço dos estudantes que participaram no programa Erasmus enfrentaram dificuldades decorrentes de incertezas sobre o sistema de ensino de outros países e da falta de correspondência e de continuidade das matérias estudadas no seu país e no estrangeiro. O reconhecimento do tempo passado no estrangeiro e das qualificações obtidas noutros Estados-Membros da UE deve ser promovido.
Certamente que não me vão dizer que 25 000 pessoas entre 400 milhões constituem um grande problema? Permitam-me que vos diga uma coisa.
Certas propostas, como a revisão da Quarta Directiva Contabilística, beneficiarão particularmente as PME.
Chama a atenção para o foco excessivo nos investimentos a realizar pelo sector privado, a par dos constrangimentos impostos ao sector público, e alerta para a necessidade de não serem desviadas verbas de sectores já subfinanciados (dando como exemplos o apoio às autoridades locais). Também critica qualquer tentativa de redução dos montantes do ICD e do Fundo Europeu para o Desenvolvimento e sublinha, uma vez mais, a insuficiente concretização dos Objectivos de Desenvolvimento do Milénio e a necessidade de aumentar a Ajuda Pública ao Desenvolvimento.
Chama-se a atenção para a necessidade de a Comissão tomar medidas imediatas para resolver a questão dos sobrevoos da Sibéria e de iniciar negociações para a celebração de acordos internacionais sobre transportes aéreos com o Japão e a Federação Russa.
Chamei a atenção para o facto, reconhecido no Painel Europeu de Inovação de 2009, de a crise económica e financeira estar a ter um impacto desproporcionado em diferentes países e regiões, minando o objectivo da convergência.
Chamo a isto a "atitude do pregador". Sabemos que, neste ultimo cenário, a Índia decididamente não quererá celebrar um acordo connosco.
Chamo ainda a atenção para a elaboração de indicadores claros e mensuráveis, que tenham em conta as alterações climáticas, a biodiversidade, a eficiência de recursos e a inclusão social, o que pode ajudar rumo a uma sociedade mais inclusiva, baseada no conhecimento e baixa em emissões de carbono.
Chamo também a atenção da Comissão para a necessidade de introduzir medidas no sentido de melhorar a conservação das frutas e produtos hortícolas e de reforçar os controlos ao seu acondicionamento.
Chamámos a atenção para o facto de que na determinação das dimensões da área, e, assim sendo, na decisão da necessidade ou não de uma AIA, deveria ter sido adoptada uma visão global em vez de se olhar para a área no seu sentido mais restrito.
Chega mesmo a apelar ao Parlamento para que tome, em conjugação com o Conselho, "medidas apropriadas" caso os governos destes Estados não demonstrem desejo suficiente de liberalizar as suas economias.
Chegaram respostas de todos os países da União Europeia, e não só. Creio que este resultado demonstra o grande interesse que a Europa atribui à investigação e à inovação, enquanto políticas para o nosso crescimento futuro.
Chegou a altura de os EstadosMembros demonstrarem que assumiram um compromisso responsável de conformidade a este novo mecanismo.
Chegou o momento de nos centrarmos não só em garantir a livre circulação, mas também em proteger melhor as fronteiras dos Estados-Membros e da própria União Europeia.
Cheguei ao fim dos meus quatro minutos e quero reservar algum tempo para intervir no final do debate, por isso termino dizendo que, neste período de austeridade e de dificuldades económicas, devemos manter a aprendizagem durante a primeira infância na agenda política, para fazermos o que é necessário neste importante domínio.
Chegámos a um compromisso na Comissão do Desenvolvimento Regional e eu aconselho esta Assembleia a incorporar o compromisso alcançado pelos políticos especializados no relatório Garriga.
Chegámos a uma situação de emergência na qual o que verdadeiramente interessa é a solidariedade e a responsabilidade; no entanto, "solidariedade” não significa apenas "todos por um”. Significa, na mesma exacta medida, "um por todos”. Todos os EstadosMembros têm de assumir a responsabilidade que lhes cabe na posse comum da nossa União e começar a agir em função do bem comum da Europa.
Chegámos inclusivamente a propor o recurso a uma linguagem muito clara nesse sentido, porém, ao mesmo tempo, é preciso ter em mente o potencial de um quadro robusto em matéria de DPI na Índia, o que certamente poderá incentivar a inovação e a investigação, inclusivamente no que se refere ao desenvolvimento de novos medicamentos.
Cidades inteligentes requerem comunicações, transportes e infraestruturas energéticas inteligentes.
Cinquenta por cento desse fundo ainda se destina a Estados-Membros ricos, como a Alemanha e a França. Isto é inaceitável.
Claramente, também não acreditam no argumento de que as preferências comerciais podem ser utilizadas para promover a prosperidade e combater o radicalismo. A UE não pode simplesmente conceder preferências comerciais nas situações em que ignora ou deixa de exigir o cumprimento de aspectos essenciais da lei.
Claro está que os europeus devem ter a sua representação - devem desempenhar o papel que lhes cabe naquela que é uma das instituições mais importantes - mas, mais fundamentalmente, o que eu gostaria de lhe perguntar é o seguinte: que tipo de política quer V. Exa. aplicar na cena internacional? Que tipo de mandato deve um europeu desempenhar na cena internacional, tendo em conta os esforços que estamos a envidar a nível interno, tendo em conta a influência dos mercados fora da União Europeia e o impacto que têm no investimento, na especulação e no emprego na Europa?
Claro que devemos estar contentes. O papel do legislador também consiste em impedir que as práticas mais questionáveis se difundam a fim de evitar que a venda por correspondência se assemelhe a uma verdadeira selva de regulamentos.
Claro que estas propostas podem melhorar ligeiramente, e durante algum tempo, o funcionamento dos bancos, mas não alteram o carácter explorador do sistema, o seu objectivo central de multiplicação de lucros e de tentativas de especulação. Por isso, no relatório falta a questão central: o controlo público e democrático de todo o sector financeiro.
Claro que há um problema em geral e, referindo-me à nossa reforma, podemos discutir o que podemos fazer para ajudar em particular o sector pesqueiro de pequena escala.
Claro que terão de ser resolvidos os obstáculos ainda existentes, como, por exemplo, as interferências na transmissão sem fios ou por TV cabo; não há qualquer dúvida sobre isso.
Claro que é preciso disciplina orçamental e menos dívidas.
Claro, devo salientar que este debate não deve ser utilizado como uma desculpa para criticar a Bulgária ou a Roménia, que sabemos que têm estado a trabalhar arduamente para cumprirem os critérios técnicos que a Comissão estabeleceu.
Cobrar aos utilizadores das estradas alguns custos externos associados dá aos Estados-Membros possibilidades adicionais para tornarem mais eficientes os respectivos sistemas de tarificação rodoviária nacionais, o que significa um melhor instrumento de gestão da procura nos transportes.
Colega Stoyanov, eu encorajá-lo-ia a ler os Tratados da União, as próprias regras procedimentais desta Casa, que dizem que nós, sendo eleitos por cidadãos europeus, devemos representar os nossos próprios Estados-Membros e os cidadãos, o conjunto dos 500 milhões de cidadãos, da União Europeia. E estamos mandatados por esses cidadãos para respeitar e fazer respeitar os Tratados fundamentais da União Europeia, que protegem os direitos dos seus cidadãos. É muito simples: tanto eu como o sr. Stoyanov temos o direito de falar em nome dos 500 milhões de cidadãos europeus enquanto estamos mandatados para tal, nesta Casa que é a casa dos cidadãos.
Colocam-se-nos duas opções: podemos dividir-nos entre as nossas partes constituintes, que vão da Alemanha, com uma população de 82 milhões de pessoas, a Malta, com uma população de 360 000 habitantes.
Colocar a ênfase no aumento da eficiência, e não na redução do consumo, terá como consequência a atribuição de prioridade às inovações tecnológicas, o que será vantajoso para nós. Estas inovações possuem um grande potencial de redução das emissões, inclusivamente para além do objectivo dos 20%.
Colocá-lo no corredor da morte seria não só uma desgraça para o historial dos Estados Unidos em termos de direitos humanos, mas seria também seria totalmente contraproducente na luta contra o terrorismo. O Presidente Obama está empenhado em pôr fim ao legado escandaloso do Presidente Bush de desrespeito do direito internacional em nome da segurança nacional. O Presidente Obama ainda tem de cumprir a sua promessa e fechar Guantánamo - uma área onde os Estados-Membros da UE poderiam e deveriam tê-lo ajudado mais.
Com a Rússia temos uma melhor parceria. O tema dos testes de segurança para as centrais nucleares desempenhará um papel central nas discussões com os nossos parceiros russos nas próximas semanas.
Com a alteração da Directiva 1999/62/CE, os Estados-Membros poderão também cobrar aos utilizadores das estradas alguns custos externos (limitados), a fim de introduzir finalmente o princípio do "poluidor-pagador" nos transportes rodoviários.
Com a apresentação desta sua proposta, a Comissão entregou o seu primeiro item no roteiro "Para além do PIB". Estes dados, numa altura em que nos estamos a esforçar, na Europa, por alcançar uma economia eficiente em termos de recursos e sustentável, permitir-nos-ão ligar factores ambientais a factores económicos, oferecendo, assim, a possibilidade de uma política mais abrangente e melhor informada.
Com a aprovação desta resolução, a Europa cumpriu um compromisso unânime de proteger os consumidores através da indicação do país de origem e da adopção de um novo mecanismo de rastreabilidade dos produtos têxteis. Nós, deputados ao Parlamento Europeu, aprovámos hoje uma declaração conjunta que visa proteger os consumidores europeus de marcas de origem dos produtos falsas ou enganosas.
Com a aprovação deste relatório o Parlamento Europeu deu o seu apoio ao Acordo entre a União Europeia e a República da Croácia sobre a sua participação nos trabalhos do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência.
Com a aprovação deste relatório, a República da Croácia passará a participar no programa de trabalho do Observatório e a partilhar dados com o OEDT, no respeito das exigências em matéria de protecção de dados previstas no Direito da União e na legislação nacional. O acordo assegura a contribuição financeira para a União, a fim de cobrir os custos da sua participação.
Com a aprovação deste relatório, congratulo-me com o facto de a alteração 74 ter sido mantida, uma vez que defende a criação de uma categoria de regiões ditas "intermédias" para o próximo período de programação 2007-2013 da política de coesão e, por conseguinte, contribui para uma distribuição mais equitativa dos fundos estruturais e de coesão entre as regiões.
Com a aprovação do relatório Garriga sobre os desafios políticos e orçamentais que a União Europeia enfrentará após 2013, o Parlamento antecipa, com excessiva timidez, em minha opinião, o debate que se aproxima sobre as futuras perspectivas financeiras da União. Este relatório reitera a sua oposição a que as diferentes políticas da competência da UE sejam postas em concorrência e insiste na necessidade de mobilizar fundos suficientes, em coerência com a estratégia UE 2020. O relatório envia uma mensagem clara aos Estados-Membros: tencionamos apoiar políticas integradas fortes e tencionamos fazê-lo por meio do aumento do orçamento em, pelo menos, 5 %. Além disso, num contexto em que a austeridade impende sobre os cidadãos, é importante manter uma política de coesão forte. É isto que propomos neste relatório, com o apoio ao projecto de criação de uma categoria de regiões intermédia, que possibilitará uma distribuição dos fundos estruturais mais adaptada às realidades económicas e sociais dos nossos territórios.
Com a crise económica, os Estados-Membros da UE tiveram de tomar decisões difíceis a respeito dos seus próprios orçamentos.
Com a entrada em vigor do Tratado de Lisboa, em 1 de Dezembro de 2009, houve um alargamento das condições nas quais é necessária a aprovação do Parlamento para a celebração de acordos internacionais.
Com a expiração do Acordo da OMC em 2005 e das medidas especiais de salvaguarda em 2008, o Regulamento do Conselho serviu o seu propósito, enquanto as medidas de restrição de importações que ele impôs puderem ser geridas com a utilização de outros instrumentos.
Com a finalidade de apoiar os Estados-Membros na elaboração das suas previsões orçamentais, a Comissão deve fornecer previsões da despesa da UE, com base no nível da despesa programada no âmbito do quadro financeiro plurianual.
Com a preparação de todo o debate, fiquei em contacto, evidentemente, com alguns ministros de certos Estados-Membros especialmente confrontados com esses aspectos dos países vizinhos.
Com a presente resolução, o Parlamento Europeu pretende manifestar o seu apoio à iniciativa da OIT de adoptar uma Convenção complementada por uma recomendação sobre trabalho digno para os trabalhadores domésticos.
Com a publicação da Estratégia UE 2020, tornou-se evidente que a aposta na investigação e desenvolvimento é fundamental para que a Europa retome o crescimento económico e ganhe a aposta da competitividade. É por isso que qualquer avaliação do Sétimo Programa-Quadro da Comunidade Europeia de actividades em matéria de investigação, desenvolvimento tecnológico e demonstração deve fazer a ligação aos objectivos da estratégia UE 2020 e à sua execução. É minha convicção que, pela via da investigação e do desenvolvimento, a Europa pode conseguir encontrar respostas eficientes e eficazes para o problema energético, para os desafios das alterações climáticas e para melhorar a competitividade e a produtividade europeias, conduzindo-nos a um novo ciclo de crescimento, agora mais sustentável.
Com a publicação do Plano de Acção relativo às Aplicações do Sistema Global de Navegação por Satélite (GNSS) e o desenvolvimento e implementação do EGNOS (Serviço Europeu Complementar de Navegação Geostacionária), a União Europeia procurou destacar as utilizações civis e garantir que a indústria europeia, a todos os níveis, tenha oportunidade de competir neste mercado estratégico em crescimento acelerado.
Com a sua iniciativa Juventude em Movimento, a Estratégia Europa 2020 atribui aos jovens um papel fundamental, tendo em vista a realização dos quatro principais objectivos até 2020: emprego, investigação e inovação, clima e energia, educação e redução da pobreza.
Com a votação de hoje, aprovámos o projecto de decisão do Conselho relativo à celebração do Protocolo que fixa as possibilidades de pesca e a contrapartida financeira previstas no Acordo de Parceria no sector da pesca entre a Comunidade Europeia e a República das Seicheles. O primeiro acordo bilateral de pesca entre a União Europeia e a República das Seicheles foi assinado em 1987, enquanto que o Acordo de Parceria no sector da pesca está em vigor desde 2006.
Com as negociações numa fase que se diz ser bastante avançada e com conclusão prevista ainda em 2011, estão ainda por discutir, em toda a sua extensão, os seus impactos sectoriais e por país. O seu conteúdo não é novo: abertura de mercados, liberalização dos serviços, incluindo os serviços públicos, crescentemente mercantilizados à mercê de multinacionais, com dificuldades acrescidas impostas aos Estados no exercício da sua função social nestas áreas.
Com as negociações numa fase que se diz ser bastante avançada e com conclusão prevista em 2011, estão ainda por discutir, em toda a sua extensão, os seus impactos sectoriais e por país.
Com as nossas acções conjuntas, com a participação do Conselho, vamos reforçar tanto a reputação e a pressão que poderemos avaliar, nos próximos dois anos, como é que a situação evoluiu, o que nos fornecerá uma experiência adicional para procedermos então a uma revisão de alta qualidade e a uma melhoria do funcionamento do sistema.
Com base na experiência adquirida com o Fundo na sua forma actual e nas sugestões feitas durante as consultas, temos grandes esperanças de que a nossa proposta possa melhorá-lo significativamente após 2013 e, em particular, resolva dois problemas com o actual mecanismo de financiamento.
Com base nas considerações precedentes, decidi votar favoravelmente o projecto em apreço.
Com base neste acordo com as regiões e com os Estados-Membros, previu-se para o período actual um orçamento total de 9 200 milhões de euros para uma política energética sustentável, com destaque para as energias renováveis e a melhoria da eficiência energética.
Com base nestes argumentos, votei favoravelmente o presente relatório.
Com base nisto, e com base na comunicação que contém as linhas gerais das reformas, a Comissão apresentará o pacote legislativo no Outono.
Com base no diálogo económico entre as Instituições europeias e os Estados-Membros, os programas nacionais de reforma terão de ser elaborados pelos Estados individuais, tendo em devida conta a realização dos objectivos da UE. É importante sublinhar que, de acordo com o texto da colega, o papel do Parlamento se concretizará através da realização, a seu pedido, de audições do Presidente do Eurogrupo.
Com base no mandato que lhe foi conferido pelo Conselho, a Comissão, em nome da União Europeia, negociou com a República das Seicheles a renovação do Protocolo do Acordo de Parceria no Sector da Pesca entre a União Europeia e a República das Seicheles.
Com base nos factos referidos, e de acordo com o regimento da Comissão dos Assuntos Jurídicos, penso que seria adequado recomendar o levantamento da imunidade neste caso.
Com base num mandato que lhe foi conferido pelo Conselho, a Comissão, em nome da União Europeia, negociou com a República das Seicheles a renovação do Protocolo do Acordo de Parceria no sector da pesca entre a UE e a República das Seicheles.
Com certeza que compreendo que o aumento do preço do combustível é susceptível de agudizar a questão, mas a principal razão para este problema ocorrer tem sido sempre a sobrepesca - a pesca acima dos limites estabelecidos, que não pode deixar os stocks em estado são. Já o discutimos e é o principal problema que temos de resolver com a nossa reforma da PCP.
Com efeito, ainda existem algumas perguntas em aberto, algumas das quais suscitadas pelo denominado "Pacto para o Euro Mais". Recentemente, organizámos uma série de debates com os parceiros sociais, incluindo a Confederação Europeia dos Sindicatos (CES), sobre a relação existente entre o diálogo social e a governação económica.
Com efeito, as empresas merecem assumir um papel de liderança na investigação e inovação, em parte porque não podemos esquecer que as políticas da UE neste domínio cresceram e se desenvolveram através da promoção de políticas destinadas a reforçar a colaboração entre a indústria, os sistemas de ensino e as instituições de investigação. Por conseguinte, considero que o relatório que acabámos de votar representa uma contribuição útil para o debate em curso sobre um futuro programa estratégico comum consagrado ao apoio à investigação e à inovação na UE.
Com efeito, como podemos definir políticas europeias se não dispusermos de dados sobre a situação em todos os Estados-Membros?
Com efeito, depois das alegações de corrupção de que o mesmo foi alvo, na sequência de artigos publicados em Março no jornal Sunday Times (recordam-se do escândalo de corrupção que abalou o Parlamento...), a Direcção Nacional de Combate à Corrupção da Roménia deu início a um processo contra o senhor deputado Severin, com base na informação segundo a qual este aceitara a oferta de um pagamento de 100 000 euros por parte de representantes de uma suposta empresa de consultadoria criada pelo Sunday Times, em troca do seu apoio a um projecto de alteração à directiva sobre os regimes de garantia de depósitos.
Com efeito, enquanto vocês, na Comissão, deram ouvidos a declarações irresponsáveis emitidas por autoridades regionais alemãs - declarações totalmente desinformadas e bastantes irresponsáveis - indicando os nomes e moradas de explorações espanholas, a população permanecia exposta, sem o saber, à bactéria.
Com efeito, estamos neste momento em vias de conhecer a proposta da Comissão não só quanto às novas Perspectivas Financeiras, mas também quanto à futura política de coesão pós-2013. A política de coesão é uma política fundamental para a União Europeia. É uma política horizontal que, através dos seus instrumentos por excelência, os Fundos Estruturais, financia projectos e programas nos Estados-Membros, procurando reduzir a disparidade entre os níveis de desenvolvimento das várias regiões. A experiência, contudo, tem-nos mostrado as dificuldades, em termos de eficiência e de resultados, que resultam da fragmentação e da complexidade desta política.
Com efeito, há que assegurar que os futuros fluxos financeiros destinados a Juba não venham a ser usados de forma inadequada ou, pior ainda, que não venham a alimentar a já generalizada corrupção. A Europa deverá também empenhar-se mais na protecção das minorias cristãs do Norte do país, que são cada vez mais alvo de perseguições e discriminação.
Com efeito, já condenámos a violação do direito de Guillermo Fariñas a comparecer aqui, em Estrasburgo, para receber o Prémio Sakharov.
Com efeito, nos últimos anos, a política ambiental e a política de sustentabilidade têm vindo a assumir particular importância, tornando as pessoas mais atentas à integração das políticas económica e ambiental.
Com efeito, num momento em que a crise global veio deteriorar a situação socioeconómica de muitas regiões, e quando já estamos a debater a futura política de coesão, era crucial que o Parlamento Europeu salientasse a sua oposição a qualquer tentativa de nacionalizar ou sectorizar a política de coesão. Neste relatório, em especial, que procurava avaliar a implementação dos programas, o Parlamento Europeu elaborou uma avaliação e destacou os êxitos, as dificuldades e as possíveis soluções. É algo que será de grande utilidade nos próximos meses, quando a União Europeia introduzir uma nova política de coesão, a partir de 2013, a qual terá de resolver as insuficiências da actual política.
Com efeito, o desenvolvimento económico de um território possui várias dimensões que não estão incluídas no PIB, que capta a fotografia de um momento preciso.
Com efeito, o panorama completo do período de programação de 2007-2013 apenas será visível em 2015, dois anos após o segundo relatório estratégico, já que certos países têm mais dois anos para utilizar todo o financiamento atribuído. Votei favoravelmente o presente relatório que alerta entre outras coisas para o facto de, em certas áreas, a selecção e a implementação efectivas dos projectos ter condicionantes que urge combater.
Com efeito, o progresso efectuado quanto à questão da Moldávia/Transnístria servirá como um teste importante para o estabelecimento de uma cooperação mais estreita em matéria de política externa.
Com efeito, os cuidados e a educação que as crianças recebem desde tenra idade e a forma como gradualmente tomam consciência do mundo que as rodeia têm uma importância decisiva no seu percurso escolar futuro.
Com efeito, para permitir que as indústrias culturais e criativas desempenhem plenamente o seu papel de força motriz, devem ser feitas adaptações em matéria de fiscalidade e aprovadas facilidades de financiamento apoiadas num conhecimento profundo das especificidades das indústrias culturais.
Com efeito, segundo a OCDE, a nossa penetração no mercado japonês é das mais baixas, e a razão de tal facto foi apontada pelos meus colegas. O problema não são as barreiras pautais - que até são relativamente baixas - mas sim as barreiras não pautais, entre as quais as complexidades regulamentares, questões relacionadas com reconhecimento mútuo, um deficiente acesso aos contratos públicos, e por aí adiante.
Com efeito, sou a favor da aplicação das funções dos sistemas globais de navegação por satélite a diferentes modos de transporte e da implementação adequada da investigação e do financiamento neste domínio.
Com efeito, temos também de pensar em formas de alterar o orçamento europeu.
Com esse fim, começámos, evidentemente, pela criança. Defendemos uma abordagem dos cuidados e da educação na primeira infância centrados na criança, dando primazia aos interesses desta.
Com esse fim, devemos investir nos cuidados e educação na primeira infância e avaliar os serviços prestados e a competência dos prestadores desses serviços. Todas as crianças devem ter acesso à educação, independentemente do meio social, e devemos garantir a mesma oportunidade para os filhos de candidatos a asilo, refugiados e todos os que tiverem autorização, ainda que temporária, para residir na União.
Com esta Directiva revista, criaremos, finalmente, um quadro europeu que confere aos Estados-Membros a possibilidade de fazer com que os custos sejam parcialmente pagos por aqueles que efectivamente lhes deram origem.
Com esta decisão, os deputados ao Parlamento Europeu reconhecem a necessidade de ultrapassar e de abandonar um modelo obsoleto, causador de desigualdades sociais e de destruição do património natural, a fim de entabular um novo modelo económico a nível europeu. O relatório abre caminho para o reconhecimento de novos indicadores mais justos que nos permitirão empreender a transição ecológica e social das nossas sociedades.
Com esta ideia em mente, importa criar um quadro legislativo capaz de apoiar o desenvolvimento destas indústrias e de incutir confiança nos consumidores e nas pessoas que trabalham no mercado digital, uma vez que este sector pode facilitar a criação de novos postos de trabalho, capitalizando assim a diversidade cultural da União Europeia e o seu potencial inovador.
Com esta questão e a resolução que se lhe seguirá, pretendo apelar aos Estados-Membros para que ajudem, onde for necessário, os profissionais da pesca a manter a sua actividade sem distorcer a concorrência.
Com esta resolução, o Parlamento Europeu congratula-se com a proposta da Comissão de dar início a negociações para a renovação do Protocolo entre a UE e a República Islâmica da Mauritânia, frisando, no entanto, que o mesmo só deve ser mantido se for mutuamente vantajoso, adequadamente ajustado e correctamente executado; saúda a proposta da Comissão de introduzir uma cláusula sobre direitos humanos; insiste em que todo e qualquer acesso negociado à pesca nas águas da Mauritânia para os navios que arvoram pavilhão da UE se deve basear no princípio das existências excedentárias, como referido na Convenção das Nações Unidas sobre o Direito do Mar; sublinha, em particular, que é necessária uma avaliação rigorosa de todas as unidades populacionais para as quais se solicita acesso ou que sejam susceptíveis de ser capturadas acidentalmente pela frota da UE; e salienta que o acesso concedido à UE deve dizer respeito a quantidades que a frota da Mauritânia não seja capaz de capturar e que, em caso de necessidade de redução das capturas, as frotas de países terceiros (UE e outros) que mais danos ambientais provocam devem ser as primeiras a diminuir as capturas.
Com esta resolução, o Parlamento Europeu exorta a UE e a Rússia a intensificarem as negociações sobre um acordo de parceria e cooperação, e pede à Rússia que implemente todos os acordos assinados anteriormente e resolva o problema dos não-cidadãos na Rússia.
Com esta resolução, o Parlamento Europeu reafirma as suas prerrogativas: actor e detentor chave da função de gestão e controlo orçamental das missões civis e militares europeias. Nós, deputados ao Parlamento Europeu, salientámos uma vez mais o nosso principal objectivo de um Parlamento forte e decisivo em matéria de política externa, particularmente agora, tendo presentes as disposições do Tratado de Lisboa.
Com esta resolução, o Parlamento: (1) insta o Conselho a atribuir excepcionalmente o título de "Capital Europeia da Cultura” a Sarajevo em 2014; e (2) expressa a sua convicção de que esta atribuição representaria uma medida importante no sentido de ultrapassar cisões europeias do passado e promover a nova Europa, através da atribuição do título de "Capital Europeia da Cultura” a uma cidade que foi palco de acontecimentos tão trágicos no decurso do século XX.
Com esta resolução, os deputados do Parlamento Europeu enviam um forte sinal político à Rússia: embora uma maior cooperação económica, energética, estratégica e internacional entre a UE e a Rússia seja desejável, ela deve, no entanto, ser condicionada pelos esforços em matéria de protecção dos direitos humanos e das liberdades cívicas.
Com estas escolhas, a União Europeia continua a ser o parceiro mais importante dos países em desenvolvimento em todo o mundo e isso é vital.
Com estas novas regras, os fornecedores continuarão a ter de mostrar claramente o preço total do produto ou serviço, com todos os custos adicionais incluídos.
Com este debate e com a votação que se lhe seguirá, concluiremos um trabalho e um período de negociação do grupo de trabalho presidido pela senhora deputada Wallis e composto por colegas de todos os Grupos políticos, bem como por uma delegação da Comissão, liderada pelo Senhor Comissário Šefčovič, cujo resultado foi a redacção de um texto de acordo sobre um registo comum em matéria de transparência. A Comissão dos Assuntos Constitucionais (AFCO) elaborou este relatório em poucos meses e concluiu também um relatório sobre a modificação do Regimento do Parlamento.
Com este documento, o Parlamento Europeu demonstrou, uma vez mais, a sua determinação em manter uma PAC forte e ambiciosa com um elevado nível de financiamento. O objectivo da PAC é apoiar os nossos agricultores e responder aos seus maiores desafios: produzir alimentos suficientes para alimentar os nossos 500 milhões de cidadãos e contribuir para alimentar o resto do mundo.
Com este objectivo, a proposta salienta, efectivamente, a necessidade de a Comissão cumprir a sua responsabilidade de manter o Parlamento constantemente informado sobre a evolução das suas negociações com os operadores de países não membros da UE. Pelas razões acima apresentadas, decidi votar a favor da presente proposta.
Com este procedimento pretende-se garantir a coerência e a adopção oportuna de todos os elementos que compõem o pacote.
Com este relatório, o Parlamento Europeu prova que a UE, longe de querer sacrificar os cuidados à primeira infância em nome da livre concorrência de serviços, respeita o modelo educacional de cada Estado-Membro.
Com este texto, o Parlamento Europeu confirma o seu apoio a este programa, que tem uma importância fundamental para o desenvolvimento da investigação europeia e o aumento da competitividade das nossas empresas. O relatório defende a criação de um orçamento permanente, que é essencial para o cumprimento dos objectivos.
Com excepção da parte respeitante à carne de animais clonados e alguns outros produtos alimentares, o texto teria sido aprovado por uma maioria muito grande. O Conselho não o quis. É o mesmo Conselho que, por um lado, se declara a favor da liberalização de tudo e, por outro, impõr a eliminação da frase "Made in" (Fabricado em) nos têxteis porque não quer dar informação correcta aos consumidores, e está a dificultar-nos a vida no que respeita à rotulagem porque não quer rótulos que indiquem o local de origem ou proveniência dos alimentos que chegam à mesa dos nossos cidadãos. Essa é a posição do Conselho.
Com frequência, procura-se apenas atribuir uma suposta legitimidade e justificação técnicas a medidas que são fruto de opções e valorações políticas (convenientemente ocultadas). Há ainda numerosas questões relativamente à metodologia a seguir em cada caso: Sobre o quê ou sobre quem vão ser medidos os impactos? Qual o escopo da avaliação? Quais as alternativas a analisar?
Com isso pretendemos assegurar um equilíbrio entre a ambição de competitividade económica e a ambição de preservação da capacidade de renovação dos nossos recursos naturais.
Com isso refiro-me a projectos de cooperação e de tratamento conjunto dos resíduos radioactivos.
Com isto "Considerando que o Grupo Consultivo dos Serviços Jurídicos do Parlamento Europeu, do Conselho e da Comissão concluiu, no seu parecer, que a proposta em apreço se cinge à codificação pura e simples dos textos existentes, sem alterações substantivas, o PE aprova a sua posição em primeira leitura, fazendo sua a proposta da Comissão, na redacção resultante da adaptação às recomendações do Grupo Consultivo dos Serviços Jurídicos do Parlamento Europeu, do Conselho e da Comissão".
Com isto, demos um importante passo em frente na uniformização das normas na União Europeia, e penso que devíamos procurar outras formas de ir ainda mais longe; onde e como podemos dar outro grande passo para reforçar os poderes da UE neste domínio? Espero que a Comissão Europeia apresente uma proposta a este respeito.
Com isto, procuraram ganhar renovadas condições para prosseguir o processo de acumulação capitalista. E assim continua sendo.
Com o Acordo, pretende-se assegurar que o comércio bilateral entre ambas as partes decorre sem problemas e com um maior nível de segurança aduaneira.
Com o Quadro da UE para a coordenação das estratégias nacionais de integração de ciganos, vamos tratar a situação difícil dos ciganos pela primeira vez ao nível europeu e vamos transformá-la numa oportunidade para todos nós.
Com o Regulamento (CE) n.º 2007/2000, a União Europeia concedeu um acesso excepcional ilimitado ao mercado da UE, com isenção de direitos, à quase totalidade dos produtos originários dos países e territórios que beneficiam do Processo de Estabilização e de Associação. O objectivo principal desta medida consiste em revitalizar as economias dos Balcãs Ocidentais graças a um acesso privilegiado ao mercado da UE. O desenvolvimento económico daí resultante favorecerá a estabilidade política em toda a região. As vantagens deste regulamento terminam em 31 de Dezembro de 2010.
Com o alargamento do espaço Schengen à Bulgária e à Roménia provaremos que a ideia de integração está viva e de boa saúde, que a Europa está a avançar e que os países que lhe batem à porta têm um futuro certo na UE, incluindo os dos Balcãs Ocidentais.
Com o devido respeito pela senhora deputada Marine Le Pen, abandonar o euro não pode ser uma opção. Qualquer Estado-Membro que abandonasse o euro - e é isso que a deputada Marine Le Pen quer para a França - veria a sua nova moeda fortemente depreciada.
Com o futuro Quadro Financeiro Plurianual, se ouvirmos o Parlamento Europeu, a política de coesão poderá evoluir para uma nova etapa graças à criação de regiões intermédias.
Com o meu voto de hoje apoiei a recomendação sobre a participação da República da Croácia nos trabalhos do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência. A República da Croácia participará, de facto, no programa de trabalho do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência, cuja principal tarefa consiste em recolher dados sobre a droga e a toxicodependência, para elaborar e publicar informações objectivas, fiáveis e comparáveis a nível europeu. O tema é claramente muito importante, tanto pelo seu marcado impacto a nível da protecção da saúde e para a luta contra as actividades criminosas associadas ao mercado da droga. A Croácia é, de facto, uma das rotas de trânsito marítimo comummente utilizadas pelo crime organizado para introduzir drogas ilegais originárias dos países produtores nos países consumidores.
Com o meu voto favorável estou, pois, a associar-me ao apelo que esta Assembleia dirige aos representantes da UE na Cimeira para que trabalhem, no âmbito desse evento, no sentido da criação de um diálogo profícuo e útil para ambas as partes, conducente a soluções partilhadas e eficazes com vista à solução das mais importantes questões inscritas na agenda política europeia e mundial.
Com o meu voto, dou o meu pleno apoio ao apelo que a resolução dirige à Comissão no sentido de esta assumir as suas responsabilidades e o seu dever de escrutinar as acções de cada um dos Estados, e de melhorar a legislação existente em matéria de protecção das empresas.
Com o objectivo de contribuir para uma maior transparência, criar-se-á um registo comum às várias instituições, no qual serão diferenciados grupos de interesses dos representantes da sociedade civil e das autoridades públicas.
Com o presente acordo, o acesso permanente às instalações do Parlamento será permitido apenas aos representantes dos interesses registados. Não obstante, o registo comum procurará garantir a mais ampla participação de todas as categorias de agentes, respeitando as suas identidades diferentes ou especiais.
Com o profundo impacto da crise económica e financeira e das repercussões da Primavera Árabe, com as suas implicações de longo alcance em termos dos requisitos para o controlo dos fluxos de emigrantes e do acesso aos recursos petrolíferos, a UE parece cada vez mais dividida e provavelmente a abandonar uma das suas mais valiosas conquistas - a livre circulação no espaço Schengen.
Com o projecto de directiva relativa à aplicação de imposições aos veículos pesados de mercadorias pela utilização de certas infra-estruturas (a Directiva "Eurovinheta"), os Estados-Membros poderão agora aplicar taxas relativas à poluição atmosférica e sonora originada pelo transporte rodoviário.
Com o relatório estratégico de 2010, o Parlamento tem, pela primeira vez, a oportunidade de analisar e avaliar os outputs e os resultados da implementação da política de coesão. É, também, uma oportunidade de exprimir a opinião do Parlamento sobre as prioridades dos Estados-Membros em termos de despesa, e de salientar domínios onde são necessários esforços adicionais, incluindo a abordagem da Comissão relativamente à implementação da política de coesão e do próprio exercício de relato estratégico.
Com o relatório hoje aprovado, a União Europeia comprometeu-se a assumir um papel de liderança a nível mundial em matéria de política social através da promoção dos seus objectivos à escala global, o que revela a importância do papel atribuído ao Parlamento pelo Tratado de Lisboa.
Com o resultado das negociações e avanços dos últimos meses no trílogo, espero que possamos contar com uma publicidade mais célere das recomendações da Comissão e com um verdadeiro diálogo económico.
Com o vosso apoio activo, estamos a reparar as debilidades sistémicas da governação económica da UE a fim de preparar uma alteração profunda no panorama da definição de políticas da União Europeia.
Com os nossos planos de governação económica, instamos agora ao reforço do Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento, em termos de medidas preventivas e correctivas, para que uma maioria a favor da imposição de sanções e a Comissão tenham o direito de intervir, quando necessário, a fim de que os cidadãos da Europa possam confiar no cumprimento das normas.
Com propostas que apontam para um crescente estreitamento da política de coesão e para um enfoque no desempenho baseado nos resultados, penso que o nível de correcções vai aumentar.
Com todo o respeito, devo informar o senhor deputado Szájer de que não existe na Constituição espanhola qualquer sombra de discriminação por motivo de origem ou de nascimento.
Com um euro instável, não se pode esperar que os Estados-Membros comecem a aumentar a sua contribuição proporcional ao PIB para o orçamento da UE, apesar da crise e da recessão, apenas porque temos a expectativa de um aumento do PIB.
Com um mercado em forte expansão e um volume de negócios estimado em mais de 200 mil milhões de euros nos próximos 10 anos, a navegação por satélite necessita de um financiamento adequado que sustente o seu desenvolvimento concreto.
Com um orçamento de cerca de 54 000 milhões de euros para o período 2007-2013, o Sétimo Programa-Quadro (PQ7) tornou-se um dos mais vastos programas de apoio à investigação a nível mundial e constitui a principal ferramenta da política de investigação da UE. O seu objectivo é capacitar a UE para responder aos grandes desafios societais que preocupam todos os Estados-Membros e aos quais não podem responder sozinhos (envelhecimento demográfico e saúde, abastecimento de energia e de água ou alimentos, desenvolvimento sustentável, alterações climáticas, etc.), bem como desenvolver os conhecimentos necessários para que as nossas empresas possam inovar mais e aumentar a sua competitividade.
Com um volume de negócios superior a 300 mil milhões de euros, a indústria da madeira na Europa proporciona mais de dois milhões de empregos e representa um importante potencial de crescimento.
Com uma instabilidade generalizada nos mercados agrícolas, riscos climáticos e uma crise alimentar, necessitamos de activar instrumentos eficazes.
Com vista a tirar pleno partido do potencial oferecido pela política de coesão, tal como o relator mostrou claramente, é necessário um empenhamento mais determinado no sentido de reduzir o fosso entre as regiões da UE altamente desenvolvidas e as regiões menos desenvolvidas.
Com vista ao aumento drástico no preço do combustível na Europa, que tem contribuído para o colapso da indústria, a política comum das pescas devia incluir um mecanismo que protegesse os pescadores contra um aumento descontrolado de preços em situações como estas. A União Europeia não pode permitir que mais um ramo da indústria marítima europeia emigre para o Extremo Oriente, como sucedeu com a construção naval e o transporte marítimo.
Com vista à salvaguarda dos diferentes interesses, a Comissão deverá aconselhar-se junto de cada Estado-Membro, bem como dos membros e dos representantes dos respectivos organismos de avaliação, a fim de garantir que as diferentes necessidades específicas não ficam subordinadas aos interesses comunitários.
Combate à corrupção no desporto europeu - Trabalhos do Comité das Pessoas Desaparecidas em Chipre (declarações escritas) 
Começam a estar cada vez mais sensibilizadas para as questões da protecção social e ambiental.
Começo, então, por falar sobre a directiva em que tenho estado a trabalhar.
Como V. Exas. referiram, o teste de esforço do ano passado foi claramente insuficiente, tal como própria a Comissão disse, em numerosas ocasiões, à nova autoridade de supervisão, a Autoridade Bancária Europeia (ABE), que coordena o teste em cooperação com as autoridades de supervisão nacionais. Têm razão, portanto, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, em se interrogarem sobre qualidade e - repito - a credibilidade dos novos testes de esforço de 2011, que começaram há algumas semanas, em Abril, e gostaria de responder às vossas perguntas e de vos dar a nossa análise em relação a cinco pontos.
Como a credibilidade de todo o sector financeiro europeu irá ser, provavelmente, avaliada de acordo com o rigor destes testes, seria bom que os mesmos fossem tão exaustivos quanto possível e reflectissem, no seu rigor, os verdadeiros riscos que o sector financeiro poderá enfrentar no período actual.
Como a deputada Ojuland, creio, já aqui referiu, nós não somos um tribunal. Não estamos aqui para decidir se estas pessoas são culpadas ou inocentes.
Como a relatora, afirmo a grande importância da "cooperação territorial" que visa suprimir as barreiras físicas, administrativas e regulamentares, e atenuar o "efeito fronteira", existentes entre as regiões, promovendo o seu desenvolvimento harmonioso.
Como a senhora mesma disse, era evidente, desde o início, que seria impossível um acordo em primeira leitura, mas temos de chegar imperativamente a acordo até ao final do ano. É essencial para os nossos serviços públicos, é essencial para as expectativas dos consumidores, é essencial para o desenvolvimento da Internet, sejam quais forem as infra-estruturas existentes. E é essencial também para a organização da retoma económica da nossa União Europeia graças a esse recurso.
Como aconteceu há um ano com o relatório do senhor deputado Lyon e no mês transacto com o relatório do senhor deputado Garriga Polledo sobre as perspectivas financeiras, iremos votar amanhã a favor da manutenção do orçamento agrícola no período de programação 2014-2020.
Como afirmavam as propostas de alteração do GUE/NGL, as intervenções militares desenvolvidas para, alegadamente, estabilizar determinados países ou regiões são o caminho errado.
Como afirmou o relator, o senhor deputado Manders, a Comissão irá também avaliar a relação entre alergias e substâncias químicas utilizadas nos produtos têxteis.
Como antigo membro do Tribunal de Contas Europeu, V. Exa. conhece bem todos estes assuntos. A reforma trienal do regulamento financeiro permitir-nos-á estabelecer a base jurídica desta simplificação, mas não me parece que mexer no risco de erro admissível seja a forma correcta de actuar.
Como aplicaram a directiva relativa à publicidade enganosa e comparativa? A menos que o Estado passe a desempenhar um papel activo e não meramente formal, este problema manter-se-á de facto ingovernável e as petições das vítimas defraudadas continuarão a acumular-se. E, todavia, não somos incompetentes nesta matéria.
Como as relações transatlânticas assentam primordialmente num conjunto de valores comuns, espero que as autoridades americanas sejam mais receptivas ao empenhamento da UE para pôr termo à pena de morte em todo o mundo.
Como assinalado pela relatora, concordamos inteiramente com um orçamento orientado para a execução da estratégia UE 2020, a competitividade e o emprego, mas esta grande preocupação não deve fazer-nos perder de vista, mais uma vez, o eterno subfinanciamento da acção externa da União Europeia. Não é compatível com o objectivo do Parlamento Europeu, da Comissão e do Conselho o facto de a União ser um actor global relevante com um aumento de 2,9%, que apenas responde à inflação.
Como atingimos o ponto em que Kadhafi tem de abandonar o poder? Temos o diálogo, em que as pessoas podem ver o futuro, trabalho esse em constante desenvolvimento.
Como bem sabem, o Parlamento e o Conselho têm de avaliá-lo em segunda leitura, mas a Comissão Europeia tenciona retomar a iniciativa política e relançá-la. Por outras palavras, o Comissário responsável pela Indústria e Empreendedorismo tenciona começar a trabalhar imediatamente para garantir a protecção dos nossos produtos, a bem da competitividade das nossas empresas e da saúde dos nossos cidadãos.
Como bem sabemos, o principal resultado da investigação é o conhecimento, seguido da oportunidade de potenciar esse resultado no sector económico ou no sector industrial. Há portanto que fazer uma distinção clara entre a instrumentalização e a valorização da investigação fundamental.
Como consequência da histeria causada pelo terramoto no Japão e pelos problemas com o reactor na central nuclear de Fukushima, os cidadãos de alguns EstadosMembros decidiram abandonar a energia nuclear num intervalo de tempo relativamente curto, apesar de continuarem a não existir sinais de problemas generalizados.
Como consequência, a procura de transporte rodoviário transfronteiras de notas e moedas de euro aumentou significativamente.
Como consequência, está a ser o foco da atenção de um crescente número de diversos membros de grupos de interesse. À luz destes desenvolvimentos, perante este cenário constitucional e em conformidade com o seu empenho na transparência, o Parlamento e a Comissão concordaram em estabelecer e manter um registo comum, a fim de dispor dos nomes e de exercer escrutínio sobre as organizações e os indivíduos que participam na elaboração e implementação das políticas da UE. As alterações mencionadas exigem que o Regulamento Interno do Parlamento Europeu seja alterado em conformidade, o que será feito com este relatório.
Como consequência, está a ser o foco da atenção de um número crescente de membros de grupos de interesse, que, além disso, desempenham um papel fulcral no diálogo aberto e pluralista, e funcionam como uma importante fonte de informação para os Membros no contexto do desempenho das suas funções. À luz destes desenvolvimentos, e em conformidade com o seu empenho na transparência, o Parlamento e a Comissão concordaram em criar e manter um registo comum, a fim de disporem de uma lista dos nomes e de exercerem escrutínio sobre as organizações e indivíduos que participam na elaboração e implementação das políticas da UE. Este registo tem de ser mantido de uma forma consistente com o direito dos Membros de desempenharem as suas funções parlamentares sem restrição e não podem ser utilizados como um pretexto para negar aos seus eleitores o acesso às instalações do Parlamento.
Como consequência, o trabalho do Parlamento tornou-se o foco da atenção de um crescente número de membros de grupos de interesse, que são uma importante fonte de informação para os deputados.
Como de costume, sob pretexto de solucionar problemas que vós mesmos criastes, quereis impor-nos mais Europa, mais poder da Comissão. Uma Comissão que não passa de um punhado de funcionários públicos designados, sem controlo democrático, mas que se erige em censor e controlador, com o direito de impor sanções aos EstadosMembros. A vossa pseudo-governação económica vai muito mais além do controlo orçamental. É nada mais nada menos que a imposição de um controlo sobre os nossos povos e as nossas nações. É a aplicação da doutrina da soberania limitada, tão cara ao grande democrata Brejnev, só que os tanques são substituídos por sanções financeiras. Não estou a exagerar: num dos relatórios, considera-se necessário declarar que, em caso de mudança da maioria após uma eleição, o novo governo deve obter autorização antes de alterar as prioridades orçamentais do seu antecessor, e ainda assim só o pode fazer marginalmente.
Como decisores políticos temos de criar condições para que as pessoas possam desenvolver e alargar as suas competências. O desenvolvimento de competências não pode ter como único fim ajudar as pessoas a encontrar um melhor emprego. O desenvolvimento de competências tem também de lhes dar a oportunidade de criar os empregos do futuro e de assim prestar um contributo activo para uma economia inovadora.
Como demonstrado pela Comissão Stiglitz, em França, em 2008-2009, é necessário pensar em novos indicadores de desenvolvimento para complementar o PIB.
Como destacamos no parecer da Comissão do Comércio Internacional, o principal objectivo da União da Inovação deve ser o desenvolvimento a longo prazo e a competitividade baseada na tecnologia, no conhecimento e no desenvolvimento da educação. Ao aumentar o investimento em investigação e desenvolvimento para 3% do produto interno bruto, temos de realizar reformas estruturais, de forma a garantir a aplicação efectiva e a acessibilidade desse investimento para as pequenas e médias empresas.
Como devemos reagir em relação a acontecimentos como a frota da liberdade que, na minha opinião, é um acto de provocação? Como devemos lidar com o Presidente Assad? Como podemos assegurar que a Organização Popular Mujahedin do Irão não receba nenhum apoio - porque me oponho à concessão de apoio a essa organização - e, ao mesmo tempo, que o Campo Ashraf não seja novamente atacado causando mortes entre os seus ocupantes? Devemos adoptar uma abordagem sensata com vista a identificar uma posição comum.
Como deverá o orçamento ser financiado? Por meio de um novo imposto europeu, claro! Quem estão eles a tentar iludir? A Europa já custa muito caro.
Como discordam aliás os milhões de trabalhadores, de agricultores, de pequenos e médios empresários e muitos outros que, por todo o mundo, ao longo dos anos, vêm apontando o dedo acusador à OMC, aos seus objectivos de desregulação do comércio e aos interesses que serve: o das transnacionais e o dos grandes grupos económicos e financeiros, que arrecadam milhões à custa do sacrifício de milhões de postos de trabalho, de direitos laborais e sociais, da destruição da pequena e média produção e da degradação ambiental.
Como disse a minha colega, senhora deputada Bélier, embora o relatório pudesse ter ido mais longe nas ambições e nas orientações que define, ele representa um primeiro passo e um sinal forte enviado ao Conselho e à Comissão para que a Europa empreenda uma reforma dos indicadores de riqueza e de desenvolvimento, de modo a torná-los mais representativos das realidades e das pressões ambientais e sociais com que estamos confrontados.
Como disse no início da minha intervenção, tenho cuidado com o emprego da palavra "histórico”. No entanto, no caso da Croácia, creio que chegámos efectivamente a um momento histórico, na medida em que estamos a enviar uma mensagem à região ocidental dos Balcãs, nomeadamente a de que há lugar na União Europeia para os países dessa região. Espero sinceramente que, amanhã e depois de amanhã, os Chefes de Estado e de Governo dos EstadosMembros da UE tomem a decisão política de aprovar a adesão da Croácia e que as negociações possam ficar concluídas nos momentos finais da Presidência húngara, o mais tardar no dia 30 de Junho. A Comissão Europeia trabalhou sem descanso para conseguir apresentar um relatório favorável no dia 10 de Junho.
Como disse no início, a Presidência húngara não está directamente envolvida nas negociações de pormenor, algumas das quais se inserem mais especificamente na esfera de competência do Eurogrupo.
Como disse o colega Peter Liese, a causa encontra-se no agente patogénico, no serótipo O104:H4 da bactéria Escherichia coli, já descrito na literatura científica e que está associado aos produtos à base de carne.
Como diz o ditado: "mais vale um pássaro na mão do que dois a voar".
Como e em que medida deverá ser financiado o ITER? Esta questão é agora um ponto recorrente na ordem do dia do Parlamento Europeu.
Como escreve o relator, a assistência da União Europeia é essencial para que os Estados-Membros se coloquem em posição de responder aos desafios futuros. A Estratégia "Europa 2020” indica os domínios pertinentes em que esta assistência deve ser concentrada, traçando as prioridades e a visão de uma Europa forte, estável e moderna; uma Europa que tenha retirado ensinamentos dos seus recentes problemas económicos e uma Europa que assegure postos de trabalho, segurança energética e alimentos saudáveis aos seus cidadãos. Os planos orçamentais devem ter em conta os objectivos mais importantes do desenvolvimento sustentável mantendo-se, ao mesmo tempo, flexíveis e centrados em medidas concretas. Não preciso de dizer que os fundos devem ser gastos de forma transparente e fundamentada. A aceitação e a compreensão do público são hoje parte integrante da política da UE e constituem a base do seu funcionamento.
Como eu já afirmei, essas dificuldades não são exclusivas da área do euro.
Como eu já disse, as medidas legislativas deveriam ser acompanhadas de uma formação adequada dos funcionários responsáveis pelo controlo da aplicação das regras.
Como ficou bem patente o ano passado, o denominado Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento, cujo objectivo era ter um efeito dissuasor eficaz contra as violações dos princípios macroeconómicos da zona euro pelos EstadosMembros, revelou-se pouco eficaz, para utilizar uma expressão branda.
Como ficou evidente, posteriormente, na votação, o resultado final foi marginalmente favorável ao candidato.
Como foi dito muitas vezes, estamos muito perto de cumprir o objectivo mas, ao mesmo tempo, é importante que tenhamos sucesso no dia da votação e em Julho.
Como foi dito, o Director-Geral deve ser alguém que procure o consenso e que seja eficaz numa altura em que a instituição tem um papel determinante para contribuir com voluntarismo para restabelecer o equilíbrio económico e financeiro. A nossa União tem, por isso, de fazer tudo o for necessário para assegurar a designação de Christine Lagarde.
Como foi referido esta manhã, o Comissário para os Direitos do Homem do Conselho da Europa, que eu muito admiro, Thomas Hammarberg, explicou-nos que este caso ainda não está encerrado, ainda continua, e que desejaria imenso que o Parlamento cooperasse com o Conselho da Europa nesta importante questão.
Como garante V. Exa. que a independência destes testes de stress está realmente assegurada? Em segundo lugar, como garante que os resultados levarão ao encerramento das centrais nucleares mais antigas?
Como hoje foi salientado em diversas ocasiões e também durante o debate, penso que este tema deve ser objecto de mais debates porque estamos a estabelecer uma pré-condição para novas divisões e exclusões no tratamento de certas regiões, que vai ao arrepio do princípio europeu da solidariedade. A categoria intermédia é contrária ao princípio da convergência das regiões europeias com um desenvolvimento inferior à média da União Europeia. Não está suficientemente claro o que serviu de base ao estabelecimento dos limites de 75% e 90%, ou por que razão, por exemplo, não foi criada uma categoria específica para as regiões particularmente subdesenvolvidas.
Como irão conduzir as conversações a partir de agora? Está indicado na vossa comunicação que no final de 2011 farão uma convenção e outras actividades. Já tive oportunidade de comunicar ocasionalmente convosco, inclusive por diálogo, durante as cimeiras sobre conhecimento e inovação decorridas nesta Casa.
Como já anunciei - e a fim de tranquilizar o senhor deputado Cancian e todos os outros deputados que manifestaram a sua preocupação quanto aos prazos demasiado longos - posso confirmar que iremos tentar apresentar o nosso trabalho antes do prazo fixado.
Como já foi dito várias vezes, os testes de resistência em 2010 foram fracos, em particular, em relação aos riscos estatais que foram ignorados quase por completo.
Como já foi dito, a nossa exigência primordial é, evidentemente, a revisão deste Tratado Euratom, que se manteve praticamente inalterado desde que foi elaborado. É certo que a auditoria dos 143 reactores nucleares europeus apenas se referirá, no final, ao cenário"Fukushima", e V. Exa definiu claramente os limites para tal, Senhor Comissário. É já uma primeira vitória; representa, em todo o caso, uma verdadeira ruptura com a cultura do segredo que tem caracterizado este sector desde mais de 40 anos.
Como já foi dito, este relatório, juntamente com relatórios anteriores e a comunicação da Comissão, procura demonstrar que o objectivo da Europa é dispor de uma política agrícola comum que garanta a segurança alimentar no continente europeu e contribua para a segurança alimentar mundial.
Como já foi dito, o novo Registo envolve também uma modificação do Regimento. Há, portanto, dois relatórios, mas, trata-se, em todo o caso, de um primeiro passo no sentido de uma mais completa transparência.
Como já foi sublinhado pelo Senhor Comissário Tajani, o prazo de 30 de Setembro de 2013 é demasiado longo.
Como já referi inúmeras vezes neste Parlamento, ao abrigo do Mandado de Detenção Europeu, a extradição - ou seja, o processo judicial de entrega, para utilizar o termo correcto - constitui agora uma mera formalidade burocrática. Não existem verdadeiras salvaguardas.
Como já referi, podemos adquirir competência quando a Constituição se traduzir em práticas legislativas, administrativas ou judiciais.
Como já referido pela Comissão Europeia, considero um absurdo que a Rússia imponha um embargo aos produtos que consumimos todos os dias e que submetemos a um controlo exaustivo. A meu ver, a reacção da Rússia é mais uma acção política, como muitas a que já assistimos no passado.
Como já tive ocasião de dizer, e esta noite mais nada direi sobre esta matéria, a ABE foi encarregada da concepção e do desenvolvimento dos testes. A Agência considerou que um choque sobre a carteira bancária era irrealista, pelo que não fazia sentido, nesta fase, realizar testes à carteira bancária.
Como membro da Comissão dos Transportes e do Turismo, tenho a certeza de que a indústria da aviação é um dos sectores em que a cooperação em matéria de comércio e investigação e desenvolvimento teria vantagens mútuas para as economias europeia e japonesa.
Como mostra o relatório, as baixas taxas de sucesso alcançadas até hoje, a falta de coordenação em relação aos objectivos partilhados (Organização Mundial da Saúde) e a ausência de indicações claras sobre a forma como esses objectivos devem ser alcançados tornam necessária, também em minha opinião, a introdução de um novo instrumento financeiro de cooperação para o desenvolvimento.
Como muitas pessoas, pensava que se tratava, basicamente, de um serviço de babysitting, mas agora sei que a educação na primeira infância é o melhor investimento e proporciona o melhor retorno possível do investimento na educação a qualquer nível.
Como muito bem aqui foi dito, os custos dos combustíveis têm um impacto muito elevado na sobrevivência dos nossos pequenos e médios armadores, estando a agravar, com particular gravidade, os já frágeis rendimentos da pesca.
Como muitos avisaram há um ano, o programa FMI-UE grego, para além do desastre económico e da devastação social que causou, revelou-se incapaz de cumprir os próprios objectivos que alegadamente o justificaram: as metas de redução do défice não foram cumpridas, a dívida pública do país rondará neste momento os 170% e os juros exigidos pelos mercados sobre a dívida pública dispararam. Não obstante, o Conselho Europeu prepara um novo ataque.
Como muitos oradores afirmaram neste debate, o mandado de detenção é uma ferramenta extremamente valiosa na luta contra a criminalidade transfronteiriça. Permitiu que se fizesse justiça em nome de muitas vítimas.
Como médico, gostaria de salientar em especial o impacto sobre a saúde humana. Não podemos esquecer o papel extremamente importante desempenhado pelos Estados-Membros nas avaliações de impacto, dado que têm de transpor a legislação proposta para os respectivos sistemas jurídicos.
Como nota o relator, em tom de aprovação, de acordo com os organismos internacionais "as normas laborais não devem ser usadas com intuitos proteccionistas”! Afinal, que princípios, que valores, que factores podem pôr em causa o poder absoluto do mercado? Fala-se muito da responsabilidade social das empresas, mas, na verdade, elas limitam-se a seguir as regras que estabeleceis.
Como o Senhor Comissário assinalou, 80% das finanças e dos fundos utilizados estão abrangidos pela responsabilidade comum e os Estados-Membros não estão a assumir a quota-parte da responsabilidade que lhe cabe neste contexto. É também aqui que temos os maiores problemas. A Comissão deverá, por isso, exercer pressão sobre os Estados-Membros para os convencer a assumirem a responsabilidade pelos fundos que a UE lhes permite gerir.
Como o colega Diogo Feio acaba de dizer, creio que introduzimos melhorias na proposta da Comissão e que, quando há um debate público, fazemos o nosso trabalho e os cidadãos podem ser informados sobre o que se passa em Bruxelas, como eles dizem.
Como o colega Peter Liese no-lo recordou ainda há pouco, os seres humanos são obviamente mais importantes d que as questões económicas, que podem ser tratadas em qualquer altura. A morte, infelizmente, é definitiva.
Como o meu colega, senhor deputado Bas Eickhout, afirmou anteriormente, o congelamento ou a redução do orçamento da UE pós-2013 não é uma abordagem credível se a UE e os seus Estados-Membros encaram com seriedade a consecução das prioridades políticas por eles definidas, particularmente na estratégia Europa 2020. A coordenação dos fundos e das acções da UE é claramente uma forma melhor de alcançarmos os nossos objectivos comuns, em contraste com as acções individuais.
Como o relator afirma, a abordagem da política social que a Europa escolhe deve igualmente ser adoptada nas nossas relações com os países terceiros. A União deve insistir de forma mais peremptória, como condição para os futuros acordos de comércio e investimento, que os acordos internacionais sejam ratificados, aplicados e controlados.
Como o relator observou tão acertadamente, as pequenas e médias empresas (PME) são a espinha dorsal da sociedade europeia e o motor da nossa economia. O mesmo pode dizer-se da Lituânia, onde 99,4% das empresas empregam menos de 250 trabalhadores.
Como os confrontos foram gravados em vídeo, o teste colocado às agências de investigação e ao sistema de justiça na Bulgária será saber se os instigadores e participantes neste incidente serão adequadamente punidos.
Como os meus colegas já aqui disseram, pelos menos três anos se passaram, três anos durante os quais essa gente, esses burlões, como lhes chamaram, e bem, numerosos colegas - e concordo com eles - foram prejudicando as suas congéneres e enganando pequenas e médias empresas, que são a coluna dorsal da economia europeia.
Como os senhores fazem sempre questão de nos recordar, a política externa comum deve cumprir os objectivos globais da União Europeia definidos nomeadamente no artigo 3.º do Tratado, entre os quais a erradicação da pobreza ocupa um lugar proeminente.
Como parte da iniciativa União da Inovação, foi proposta uma Parceria-piloto Europeia para a Inovação com o objectivo de cobrir toda a cadeia de inovação, partindo da investigação e desenvolvimento, a fim de garantir a existência das condições adequadas para que os resultados da investigação e desenvolvimento sejam levados com êxito ao mercado.
Como parte de uma possível estratégia de resposta, debruçar-nos-emos sobre uma série de elementos importantes: reforçar a presença da UE em Juba, aí estabelecendo uma delegação da UE; o início de um diálogo político abrangente; a estabilização do Sudão do Sul e da fronteira conjunta através de medidas e instrumentos específicos - incluindo a Política Comum de Segurança e Defesa e o instrumento de estabilidade - e o aumento da ajuda ao desenvolvimento.
Como parte do mecanismo de cooperação no domínio da segurança nuclear, estamos a considerar um projecto destinado a ajudar os grupos populacionais mais significativamente afectados em torno da zona de exclusão de Chernobyl. É nossa intenção tratar mais aprofundadamente os elos entre a saúde e a nutrição. Caso se demonstre ser útil levar a cabo actividades orientadas na avaliação das consequências para a saúde humana em todas as zonas afectadas pela precipitação radioactiva de Chernobyl, a Comissão está pronta a tomar providências e a transferir a responsabilidade da coordenação das medidas adequadas para o Comité de Segurança da Saúde da UE.
Como pode essa governação funcionar quando, por um lado, é instituído um protectorado real - a Grécia - e, por outro lado, os contribuintes das nações mais prósperas vêem as suas obrigações pilhadas pelo Banco Central Europeu ou pelos bancos mal-intencionados? Pergunto-me como se pode explicar às pessoas que faziam questão de não abdicar do xelim e do marco que agora, subitamente, precisamos de euro-obrigações simplesmente porque não é possível manter os bancos sob controlo - a propósito, Senhor Deputado Hughes, é muito interessante que os sociais-democratas tenham percebido isto agora. Só consigo imaginar uma explicação se cedermos finalmente e afirmarmos que devíamos ter tomado esta e aquela medida naquele período; se admitirmos os nossos erros e, enquanto a Europa se desintegra à nossa volta, apresentarmos finalmente uma visão em que consigamos sobreviver à globalização.
Como podem eles sair desta situação? Através de um processo de transição neutro, inclusivo e consensual. Não estamos aqui para dar o nosso apoio a uma parte ou outra, mas para apoiar a ideia deste tipo de processo.
Como podem imaginar, as indicações de origem serão, sem dúvida, um dos elementos prioritários e centrais do nosso trabalho. A revisão constituirá, pois, uma oportunidade para reafirmar o meu apoio à indicação de origem e para clarificar esta questão de uma vez por todas, pois trata-se de um instrumento essencial para a competitividade das empresas europeias e para a saúde dos cidadãos da União. Estudaremos aprofundadamente esta matéria a fim de prever regras claras, prevenindo informações enganosas e facilitando escolhas responsáveis por parte dos consumidores aquando da aquisição de produtos têxteis.
Como podemos apoiar as empresas e cidadãos dos 'novos' Estados-Membros neste teor?
Como podemos falar de guerra comercial, se, ao mesmo tempo, queremos rotular a carne de animais clonados e a carne de proveniente de descendentes de animais clonados? Devíamos ter feito mais esforços nesta área e não ter dito de imediato, assim que os americanos exprimiram as suas dúvidas, que não podíamos fazer isto.
Como podemos permitir que esta situação persista? Dispomos de legislação e de proibições, porém são ineficazes.
Como podemos ter uma política comum se um dos principais países da UE vota em sentido contrário ao de outros dois países importantes da UE? A sua tarefa é impossível.
Como poderemos aumentar a eficácia dos nossos investimentos em investigação? Creio que as contribuições feitas pelo Conselho Europeu de Investigação (CEI) e pelo Instituto Europeu de Inovação e Tecnologia na área da investigação têm grande interesse e inspiração, e poderão vir a produzir bons resultados.
Como poderá essa situação idílica concretizar-se com a maior brevidade possível?
Como posso permanecer indiferente a um texto sobre pluralismo e à concentração do poder em autoridades reguladoras, como as estabelecidas na recente lei húngara sobre os meios de comunicação social? Devemos todos preocupar-nos com a democracia quando um partido no governo aprova leis que cimentam o seu poder muito para além do fim do seu mandato e limita a relevância das futuras eleições, e com líderes políticos que vão ao ponto de elaborar ou alterar leis fundamentais que servem apenas as suas convicções políticas ou as suas políticas económicas. E, sim, estou preocupada com a propagação deste modelo húngaro.
Como quer que ocorra a reconciliação de um povo? Terá de envolver ambas as facções. Não bastam os Tamil, Senhor Deputado Van Orden.
Como recomendações principais para a revisão gostaria de destacar a simplificação no acesso aos fundos, a adaptação das prioridades temáticas e a adequação das regras de participação a novos desafios. A simplificação do acesso aos fundos para a investigação permitirá tornar as regras e os processos mais simples, claros e transparentes.
Como recordamos dos protestos pós-eleitorais de Dezembro do ano passado, Lukashenko não tolera a dissidência e aparentemente tem gosto em recorrer à violência e à intimidação contra activistas pró-democracia.
Como refere a comunicação da Comissão, o certo é que a Europa não tem falta de potencial humano, técnico, comercial ou financeiro. A minha pergunta é: o que está a Europa a fazer para utilizar preferencialmente o potencial de recursos humanos que possui? Como pretende a Europa segurar os seus recursos humanos, essenciais à inovação das escolas, universidades e centros de investigação europeus? Antes de pensarmos em atrair especialistas de fora da União Europeia, penso que a nossa prioridade deverá ser a de travar o êxodo de investigadores da Europa para outros pólos de investigação importantes. A criação de um sistema educativo moderno à escala europeia, que aposte fortemente na obtenção de resultados substantivos no domínio da investigação e, naturalmente, na simplificação do acesso a programas de investigação transfronteiriços a nível europeu, pode contribuir para o aumento do nível de inovação na UE. No entanto, para garantir a fixação dos recursos humanos, a Europa tem de apostar no seguinte aspecto: fazer ofertas atractivas aos investigadores, ofertas que não possam recusar.
Como refere o relator, esta proposta de regulamento constitui um passo em frente no sentido de uma contabilidade ambiental mais abrangente.
Como referi, digo aos cidadãos que acredito que eles estão protegidos, mas não o posso garantir.
Como referiram vários oradores, a votação de amanhã é muito importante, e eu acredito que ela correrá bem.
Como referiu, qualquer violação dos Tratados da União Europeia pode ser resolvida em tribunal.
Como relator acidental e, mais uma vez, malgré moi, deste relatório, permitam-me apenas duas observações. A primeira é que esta discussão mostrou tanta ou maior divisão sobre esta matéria do que na própria Comissão do Comércio Internacional, e a segunda é que o mérito das propostas aprovadas na Comissão do Comércio Internacional, algumas das quais a Comissão Europeia considera não concludentes... o plenário amanhã decidirá sobre o mérito dessas propostas e das objecções da Comissão.
Como relator de parecer da Comissão do Ambiente, da Saúde Pública e da Segurança Alimentar, procurei sustentar esta ideia, chamando a atenção para alguns dos principais desafios que enfrentamos nestas áreas: a escassez e a eficiência do uso dos recursos, a valorização e tratamento de resíduos, a qualidade e segurança alimentares, as mudanças demográficas, as novas epidemias, a conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade - apenas para citar alguns exemplos.
Como relatora do parecer da Comissão da Indústria, da Investigação e da Energia para este relatório, considero que alcançar e sustentar a qualidade de vida envolve factores importantes, consensuais, tais como saúde, educação, cultura, emprego, habitação e condições ambientais.
Como resultado, a 23 de Setembro aprovámos a comunicação que estabeleceu uma abordagem faseada para o corpo.
Como resultado, é o centro das atenções de um número ainda mais significativo de representantes de grupos de interesses ("lobbyists"), que, além disso, desempenham um papel fundamental no diálogo aberto e pluralista em que assenta um sistema democrático, actuando como uma importante fonte de informação para os deputados no quadro do exercício das suas funções.
Como resultado, é o centro das atenções de um número ainda mais significativo de representantes de grupos de interesses ("lobbyists"), que, além disso, desempenham um papel fundamental no diálogo aberto e pluralista em que assenta um sistema democrático, actuando como uma importante fonte de informação para os deputados no quadro do exercício das suas funções. À luz desses desenvolvimentos, neste contexto constitucional, e de acordo com seu compromisso para com a transparência, o Parlamento e a Comissão concordaram em estabelecer e manter um registo comum, a fim de manter uma lista dos nomes das organizações e indivíduos que participam na elaboração e implementação das políticas da UE e de exercer controlo sobre os mesmos.
Como sabe, a avaliação deste risco de liquidez não faz parte do teste de esforço propriamente dito, cujos resultados serão tornados públicos.
Como sabe, desde Março de 2009, todos os Estados-Membros, assim como a Suíça, concordaram em aplicar a norma da Organização de Cooperação e de Desenvolvimento Económicos (OCDE), que estipula que um Estado-Membro não pode recusar-se a prestar informação, se tal lhe for solicitado por outro Estado-Membro, pelo motivo de essa informação estar na posse de outro banco ou de qualquer outra instituição financeira.
Como sabem, a anterior Cimeira UE-Japão, realizada em Abril do ano transacto, instituiu um grupo misto de alto nível, composto por altos funcionários, para identificar formas de reforçar em todos os aspectos as relações entre o Japão e a UE, nos domínios político, económico e da cooperação sectorial.
Como sabem, a aplicação do actual FSE assenta no princípio da gestão partilhada, um sistema de gestão que julgo não ser compatível com os objectivos do FEG.
Como sabem, as ANC procedem à notação de três sectores diferentes - o sector público, as empresas e os instrumentos financeiros estruturados.
Como sabem, as negociações estão a avançar bem. A Comissão quer conseguir um acordo equilibrado, ambicioso e de grande qualidade e que seja igualmente ambicioso no domínio do desenvolvimento sustentável. O Canadá é um parceiro altamente desenvolvido, com posições semelhantes à nossa e laços estratégicos que ultrapassam as relações comerciais e o investimento. A UE e o Canadá partilham nesta negociação os mesmos objectivos ambiciosos, que podem ser concretizados para nosso benefício mútuo, criando um potencial de novas oportunidades.
Como sabem, as nossas relações transatlânticas assentam em valores que partilhamos há muito tempo, tal como os direitos humanos universais e o direito a um julgamento justo. É essa a razão pela qual os Estados Unidos da América têm de examinar os seus tribunais militares, encerrar Guantánamo e abster-se do recurso à tortura em todos os casos.
Como sabem, essa era a opinião da comissão, expressa na terça-feira, e pensamos que podemos agora ter mais debates com o Conselho, com vista a alcançar um resultado satisfatório.
Como sabem, o Conselho e o Parlamento estão neste momento em negociações para conseguir pôr o programa de reinstalação a funcionar, e esta é também uma área onde a Comissão Europeia poderia analisar as possibilidades de financiar grande parte desse programa.
Como sabem, o funcionamento e a governação das agências estão a ser discutidos no âmbito do grupo de trabalho interinstitucional que envolve a Comissão, o Parlamento e o Conselho, nomeadamente com base numa avaliação de múltiplas agências encomendada pela Comissão em 2009.
Como sabem, tem havido negociações aturadas sobre a proposta de regulamento que altera o Regulamento Frontex. A agência Frontex constitui um instrumento europeu por excelência fundamental para o controlo das nossas fronteiras externas. A Presidência congratula-se com os resultados positivos da última reunião do trílogo.
Como sabemos, desde o Tratado de Lisboa, este Parlamento passou a ter o direito a ser informado sobre todos os passos da negociação de acordos internacionais o que inclui, obviamente, os acordos de comércio internacional que, aliás, constituem uma competência exclusiva do nosso Parlamento e, por isso, onde o escrutínio parlamentar se torna mais justificado.
Como sabemos, embora a partida dos habitantes deslocados seja sempre muito rápida, o seu regresso leva tempo e é muitas vezes fonte de problemas humanitários e sociais consideráveis.
Como sabemos, nas últimas décadas, foi concluída uma série de acordos-quadro para as relações comerciais e económicas, desde acordos sectoriais até às mais diversas iniciativas comerciais.
Como sabemos, o diabo está nos pormenores, por isso gostaríamos de saber o seguinte, Senhor Comissário: quais os pormenores das negociações no que se refere aos concursos públicos no sector dos serviços ou à migração de trabalhadores? Qual o texto em cima da mesa em matéria de direitos de propriedade intelectual? Qual a situação no que se refere ao ambiente e à agricultura? Recorrendo aos textos específicos, pretendemos verificar se o papel da Índia como a "farmácia dos pobres do mundo" está a ser posto em causa, ou se a produção de medicamentos mais baratos contra a malária e para o tratamento da SIDA será obstruída pelo acordo, sem esquecer os investimentos maciços em investigação efectuado pelas nossas próprias empresas farmacêuticas.
Como sabemos, o trabalho doméstico representa oficialmente entre 5% a 9% de todo o emprego da União Europeia.
Como se devêssemos sequer questionar se se devem ou não rotular produtos à venda no mercado europeu, quando a liberdade de escolha do consumidor é fundamental à luz do direito europeu!
Como se isso não fosse suficiente, no Sudão do Sul as rivalidades entre as tribos e grupos armados estão também a aumentar e os observadores estimam que já mais de mil pessoas perderam as suas vidas desde Janeiro último.
Como se pode constatar pelas margens dos títulos de dívida, a Espanha está a dissociar-se desses países, graças a uma acção determinada nas frentes orçamental, financeira e estrutural.
Como se pode ver a partir de relatórios anteriores, apesar de um considerável investimento financeiro e de uma logística e gestão excelentes, as forças europeias não conseguiram fazer face a simples missões de polícia no Kosovo e na Bósnia.
Como se refere na Estratégia "Europa 2020”, o conhecimento e as qualificações internacionais são decisivas para os sistemas educativos. O multilinguismo, a literacia digital (e-skills) e a sensibilidade cultural permitem-nos aproveitar muitas das oportunidades oferecidas pelo actual mercado de trabalho global. A cultura deve, pois, ser integrada transversalmente no vasto leque de acções que constitui a política externa da UE. A União Europeia não possui actualmente uma estratégia coerente e coordenada para a integração da cultura nas suas acções externas. São também perceptíveis a fragmentação e a dispersão não só entre os Estados-Membros mas também entre diferentes departamentos e instituições da União Europeia.
Como se refere na Estratégia Europa 2020, o conhecimento e as competências internacionais são cruciais para a educação e o emprego, mas também podemos encarar a cultura como um ingrediente que ajuda a promover, entre outros, a democratização, a liberdade de expressão, a inclusão, o desenvolvimento, a educação e a reconciliação.
Como se refere na resolução, o Parlamento Europeu recebeu mais de 400 petições sobre práticas comerciais enganosas, muito espalhadas, utilizadas por editores de directórios de empresas, que afectam milhares de empresas, na sua maioria pequenas empresas. São práticas que, em geral, têm um impacto financeiro significativo.
Como segunda medida, na sequência do estabelecimento das três novas agências europeias de supervisão financeira, a regulamentação das agências de notação de crédito será reforçada pela introdução de uma supervisão centralizada da autoridade europeia de supervisão (Autoridade Europeia dos Valores Mobiliários e dos Mercados). O regulamento alterado teve efeitos a partir de 1 de Junho de 2011.
Como signatários da Convenção sobre a Diversidade Biológica, da Convenção-Quadro sobre as Alterações Climáticas ou de qualquer outra, temos de estar em condições de informar o resto do mundo do nosso bom ou mau desempenho no respectivo cumprimento.
Como tal, considero essencial que se apliquem medidas para a redução do abandono escolar precoce, para o aumento do número de licenciados e para o incremento da atractividade do ensino e formação profissionais. A aposta na educação e na formação não deve ser vista como uma despesa, mas sim como um investimento para o futuro.
Como tal, creio que é importante reinvestir nos programas de mobilidade e educação/formação já existentes e estabelecer condições mínimas, a nível europeu, para os estágios, uma vez que estes não deverão ser vistos como emprego, mas sim um adquirir de conhecimentos práticos.
Como tal, nenhuma regulamentação pode restringir um dos direitos básicos dos cidadãos. No entanto, os motivos pelos quais um representante eleito decide dar prioridade a um interesse em detrimento de outro devem basear-se nas suas convicções, e não no benefício pessoal. A transparência do trabalho de um deputado em contacto com pessoas que promovem os seus próprios interesses é o instrumento que, porventura, melhor prevenirá a corrupção na elaboração das leis.
Como tal, queremos garantir que sejam oportunamente disponibilizados fundos adequados, em conformidade com o princípio do "poluidor-pagador", que os programas nacionais incluam estimativas de custos minuciosas e fiáveis, e que aos empregados e à população em geral sejam dadas informações sobre todas as questões relacionadas com a gestão de resíduos. É importante que o financiamento também seja transparente.
Como tal, surge com toda a lógica este novo Protocolo com São Tomé, em 15 de Junho de 2010, para o período de 2011-2014, para o qual o Parlamento Europeu tem de dar o seu consentimento.
Como tenciona a Comissão resolver esta questão?
Como todos sabem, a suspeita inicial suscitada pelas autoridades alemãs de que a causa estaria em pepinos de origem espanhola não foi confirmada por qualquer dos resultados de testes até agora disponibilizados.
Como todos sabem, os Estados-Membros têm a possibilidade de cobrar taxas mais elevadas de utilização de infra-estruturas durante os períodos de ponta.
Como um mecanismo de última instância e se uma situação crítica o justificar, essas decisões poderão determinar a reintrodução temporária dos controlos nas fronteiras internas, mas sempre num quadro comunitário.
Como vai a UE garantir que o referendo é justo, ou seja, que ambos os lados são ouvidos e gastam quantias idênticas? Desconfio que seja possível um referendo livre e justo. O país será inundado com propaganda da UE e os que se opuserem à adesão da Croácia irão sendo afastados do debate.
Como vimos na prática, e como apontaram vários oradores, os testes de resistência do ano passado não atingiram o seu objectivo de realçar quais os bancos que gozam da necessária confiança dos seus consumidores, dos seus credores e das autoridades reguladoras nacionais.
Como é do vosso conhecimento, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, estamos a trabalhar num quadro legislativo para a gestão da crise, a resolução bancária, que já tivemos oportunidade de debater diversas vezes. O meu objectivo é dotar as autoridades de supervisão nacionais e o futuro comité de resolução para estas instituições transnacionais de uma caixa de ferramentas para tomar medidas preventivas, evitar que os riscos diagnosticados numa fase bastante precoce se transformem em crises e impedir que as próprias crises se transformem em catástrofes.
Como é do vosso conhecimento, o sector bancário irlandês foi sujeito a uma segunda ronda de testes de esforço e o novo governo implementou um plano de reestruturação. O capital adicional requerido era de 24 mil milhões de euros. O efeito sobre a economia irlandesa é que neste momento as empresas "boas” estão com falta de capital porque os bancos lutam para satisfazer as diferentes exigências.
Como é evidente, a agricultura tem de realizar uma abordagem positiva às questões ambientais.
Como é evidente, o problema é que não pode haver um sistema duplo na União Europeia: as mesmas regras têm de se aplicar a todos.
Como é hábito, aquele que respeita a lei carregará o fardo das suas responsabilidades, enquanto o infractor continuará pelo mesmo caminho.
Como é possível, afinal, que nesta União - em que um dos nossos grandes feitos em matéria de liberdades fundamentais é a livre circulação dos nossos cidadãos - subitamente dois chefes de governo possam, de forma arbitrária, inutilizar um dos nossos verdadeiramente grandes feitos - uma expressão excelente que utilizou na sua declaração - por causa de um problema marginal que pode facilmente ser controlado? Como é que é possível? Tudo o que essas pessoas precisam para ganhar é que não exista uma oposição suficiente.
Como é que a Comissão avalia o progresso da UE no que se refere à sua capacidade para aproveitar meios militares e humanitárias de uma forma coordenada?
Como é que isso está a ser conseguido? Por isso, gostaria de lhe solicitar que apresente um pacote forte, que permita melhorar as condições macroeconómicas nestes países da zona euro.
Como é que poderíamos ter influenciado o processo numa fase mais inicial? É evidente que estas discussões ocorrem numa fase já relativamente tardia, cinco anos depois de ter sido concedida a licença de construção. Este é um problema fundamental porque, nos termos do Tratado, aplica-se a subsidiariedade, e a responsabilidade pela execução da legislação europeia incumbe em primeiro lugar aos Estados-Membros, que têm de administrar e fazer cumprir a legislação a nível local.
Como é sabido, a economia das Seicheles baseia-se essencialmente no turismo e na pesca; com efeito, a indústria do peixe constitui 15% do PIB e emprega 17% da população activa local.
Como é sabido, o relatório realça a importância das florestas enquanto principal contribuinte para a mitigação e adaptação às alterações climáticas, o que torna necessário o reforço da estratégia da UE de combate aos factores que causam a sua deterioração, como as pragas, os incêndios florestais, etc.
Como é óbvio, cada indivíduo vem por um motivo, nomeadamente porque "ele" - porque se trata muito frequentemente de indivíduos do sexo masculino - não tem trabalho na Tunísia. A situação de cada uma destas pessoas merece o meu maior respeito, mas nem todos podem vir para a Europa. É muito melhor para estas pessoas encontrarem um futuro na Tunísia - e é por isso que estamos a trabalhar com as autoridades tunisinas e com a Itália para ver como é que podemos ajudar a Itália a criar emprego e crescimento -, porque não são refugiados.
Como é óbvio, há que incentivar a inovação, mas tal não deverá ser feito em detrimento de outras políticas fundamentais para o futuro da União Europeia, como é o caso da Política Agrícola Comum. A PAC deve ser reformulada apostando em alguns objectivos fundamentais, mas sem espoliar a única política integrada da União Europeia.
Como é óbvio, isto está relacionado com as comunicações móveis e de banda larga sem fios, com a difusão radiofónica e televisiva e igualmente com as radiocomunicações em concertos ou em teatros.
Como é óbvio, todos os julgamentos deste tipo pelas autoridades norte-americanas - um país que, afinal, é uma democracia e partilha os nossos valores comuns - têm, apesar disso, de ser conduzidos de forma justa, dentro do respeito de todas as devidas garantias processuais e, idealmente, por tribunais civis.
Comparado com o entusiasmo popular daquela altura, o reforço de agora das fronteiras internas parece uma completa negação do ideal de Schengen. A liberdade, a livre circulação de pessoas e bens e a solidariedade com todos os que precisam de solidariedade, devem continuar a ser prioridades da UE. Oponho-me às fronteiras internas e por isso espero um reforço dos mecanismos de controlo de Schengen, em oposição às tendências populistas de alguns Estados, em oposição à radicalização e à intolerância e para a consolidação do sistema Schengen, que é uma das maiores conquistas da Europa de hoje.
Compartilho profundamente da preocupação do Governo russo e gostaria de que a República da Letónia proibisse as importações de legumes, até a perigosa infecção ser completamente eliminada.
Compete aos Estados-Membros, com a ajuda da Comissão Europeia, proteger e desenvolver as nossas florestas para as próximas gerações, para que no futuro possam continuar a contribuir para os habitats naturais, para a nossa sociedade e para a nossa economia.
Compete às autoridades dos Estados-Membros individuais garantir que as condições dos estabelecimentos prisionais cumprem as normas, independentemente do facto de as pessoas terem sido entregues por outros Estados-Membros.
Compete-nos a nós e também a si fazê-lo. Temos de usar os cargos - na verdade, são três - que foram reunidos no Tratado de Lisboa e que a senhora baronesa representa, não para encontrar e depois aplicar o menor denominador comum entre os Estados-Membros, mas sim para assumir a liderança política, de modo a conferir à posição comum um cargo ainda maior e a torná-la tão convincente que consigamos a adesão dos outros países.
Composição do Parlamento: ver Acta
Compreendemos perfeitamente o desejo dos países emergentes - e especialmente dos maiores - de terem uma voz mais activa nas decisões do FMI.
Compreendo as preocupações que podem existir a este respeito, e os senhores deputados sabem evidentemente que as questões relativas aos direitos humanos fazem parte integrante do nosso relacionamento a longo prazo com o Paquistão. Todavia, dada a natureza temporária da derrogação com vista a fazer face à situação de emergência, a Comissão crê que tais condições não seriam adequadas.
Compreendo como é difícil quando cada Estado-Membro tem exigências muito diferentes relativamente àquilo que deveria ser incluído na reforma da PAC, mas há aqui uma matéria relevante que é, obviamente, a componente ecológica. É importante que os produtores agrícolas estejam envolvidos na política ambiental sustentável, mas como será estabelecido este sistema ecológico? Tem de o ser de acordo com a descrição do senhor deputado Dess. Não deveria criar mais burocracia, nem deveria aumentar os custos para os produtores.
Compreendo que alguns de vós tenham manifestado preocupações quanto ao reconhecimento ou à regularização dos migrantes ilegais, mas preocupa-me igualmente o combate que teremos de travar em cada Estado-Membro contra o trabalho não declarado.
Comunico que recebi, ao abrigo do n.º 5 do artigo 115.º do Regimento, uma proposta de resolução.
Conceder às empresas europeias o acesso aos contratos de direito público na Índia poderá contribuir para o desenvolvimento das nossas empresas.
Conclui-se, assim, que a qualidade da investigação nas regiões pouco representadas nos projectos é baixa.
Concluindo, as reformas fundamentais da regulamentação financeira e da governação económicas na União Europeia estão a operar uma transformação profunda na arquitectura económica e financeira da Europa.
Concluindo, esta proposta é simplesmente uma fronteira que vai longe demais.
Concluo com um apelo ao Parlamento e à Comissão para que o programa Juventude em Acção não sofra cortes de financiamento ou seja até eliminado a favor do programa Juventude em Movimento. O trabalho das associações de jovens é importante para o envolvimento social e ajuda os jovens a progredirem, tanto em termos de competências como ao nível pessoal.
Concluímos negociações bilaterais sobre a adesão da Rússia à OMC, chegámos a um acordo quanto à abordagem de um eventual regime de isenção de vistos e definimos a Parceria para a Modernização, que se encontra actualmente em fase de aplicação.
Concordamos com a ideia de adoptar, no início do período de programação, uma abordagem "territorial" a fim de canalizar as dotações de "convergência" e "competitividade e emprego" para um certo número de projectos prioritários, como as redes transeuropeias de transporte (RTE-T), previamente definidos e acordados com os parceiros nos programas, no respeito dos princípios básicos da governação a diversos níveis e da parceria europeia.
Concordamos com a necessidade de planificação e organização do espectro radioeléctrico baseada na cooperação necessária entre os Estados-Membros, enquanto bem público, questão importante no melhoramento dos serviços, em particular dos serviços públicos.
Concordamos com a relatora em que é necessário apresentar uma estratégia gradual que indique como a nova abrodagem pode ser utilizada de forma pragmática no trabalho político quotidiano.
Concordamos com um sistema global de navegação por satélite que possa apoiar o desenvolvimento, a modernização e a diversificação de serviços públicos - designadamente no domínio dos transportes. O GNSS não pode todavia deixar de ser analisado em toda a multiplicidade de dimensões em que poderá ter aplicação. Nessa medida, questionamos os limites das potenciais utilizações destes programas num quadro de competição assumida entre a UE e os EUA, no que respeita às funcionalidades e eficiências destes sistemas.
Concordamos que as indústrias cultural e criativa são uma grande força geradora de postos de trabalho, de crescimento e de receitas de exportação, bem como de inclusão social e de diversidade cultural e linguística e ainda de diálogo intercultural na União Europeia e para lá das suas fronteiras.
Concordamos que é uma relação multifacetada, em que as questões económicas, sociais e ambientais, os direitos humanos e o Estado de direito, os aspectos de segurança e a cooperação política assumem, todos eles, uma importância fundamental.
Concordaria com isso nos próximos regulamentos? Que tipos de proposta serão abrangidas?
Concordei com o teor do presente documento porque o Tratado de Lisboa, que entrou em vigor em 1 de Dezembro de 2009, aumentou os casos em que a aprovação do Parlamento era necessária para a conclusão de acordos internacionais.
Concordo com Mario Monti quando este referiu que uma excessiva deferência para com os grandes países contribuiu de algum modo para a presente crise económica, e as nossas propostas podem, pelo menos, fazer com que isso deixe de acontecer no futuro. Só espero que não se dê o caso de estarmos a trancar as portas depois da casa roubada.
Concordo com a criação de um sistema de planeamento e de execução integrado abarcando todos os domínios políticos. A virtude do planeamento integrado reside na compreensão de que os problemas complexos devem ser abordados simultaneamente de diversas formas. O desemprego não pode ser resolvido apenas com a formação dos desempregados, mas também com políticas de criação de emprego, de apoio às PME ou às empresas em fase de arranque.
Concordo com a focalização dada pelo relator a dois vectores muito importantes para a investigação europeia futura, sendo estes uma maior simplificação nos pagamentos entre a Comissão Europeia e outras entidades e uma acrescida participação das PME e da indústria em geral na resposta aos grandes desafios sociais.
Concordo com a ideia do relatório de que é muito importante colocar a tónica na criação de novos programas que permitam que os jovens combinem o trabalho com os estudos.
Concordo com a necessidade de reforçar o papel das organizações internacionais com competências nesta matéria - nomeadamente a Organização Internacional do Trabalho (OIT), a Organização Mundial do Comércio (OMC), a Organização de Cooperação e de Desenvolvimento Económicos (OCDE) e as Nações Unidas - e a sua cooperação com vista à elaboração, aplicação e promoção de normas sociais fundamentais de âmbito internacional.
Concordo com a opinião do relator quando este afirma que a necessidade de um mercado interno único é crucial para que a Europa assuma um papel de liderança na economia global, com ênfase no sector dos serviços e na economia do conhecimento. A Agenda Digital e a economia digital podem ser uma ponta de lança para tornar o Mercado Interno uma realidade para todos os sectores da nossa economia.
Concordo com a perspectiva adoptada pelo G8. Penso que é do nosso interesse comum que haja não só sociedades abertas como também economias abertas.
Concordo com a posição defendida na resolução de que, se a cooperação económica entre a UE e a Índia se basear num sistema de valores universais partilhados, poderá servir de modelo para a cooperação com outros países.
Concordo com a posição do relator segundo a qual, embora algumas questões estejam ainda pendentes e exijam relatórios regulares e um acompanhamento no futuro, elas não constituem um entrave à plena adesão destes dois Estados-Membros ao espaço Schengen. A inclusão da Bulgária e da Roménia no espaço Schengen é muito importante para ambos os países, promovendo o crescimento económico e o desenvolvimento do investimento, e para toda a União Europeia, aumentando a integridade e a solidariedade entre os Estados-Membros.
Concordo com a posição expressa na resolução segundo a qual os objectivos fixados no quadro da Estratégia "Europa 2020”, nomeadamente o de reduzir a taxa de abandono escolar para menos de 10% e o de aumentar para pelo menos 40% a proporção dos jovens que completam o ensino superior, têm de ser prosseguidos através de medidas específicas, criativas e eficazes.
Concordo com a possibilidade de se solicitarem reformas estruturais em países com superávit, mas a maior atenção deverá ser concedida aos países deficitários.
Concordo com a presente proposta, que votei favoravelmente, mas considero necessário o acompanhamento científico do controlo das capturas, a modernização dos sistemas de controlo da navegação e a limpeza de destroços. Para além disso, deve reforçar-se a vigilância e proceder-se ao aprisionamento das embarcações ilegais.
Concordo com a proposta do senhor deputado Duff segundo a qual os relatores devem nomear os representantes de grupos de interesses com quem tiveram contacto durante a elaboração dos projectos legislativos. Não há dúvida que nós, nesta Assembleia, somos olhados com uma razoável suspeição por parte dos nossos eleitores.
Concordo com a recomendação no sentido de, ao criarem um sistema de ensino e de formação profissionais, os Estados-Membros prestarem especial atenção aos trabalhadores pouco qualificados, aos migrantes, às pessoas com deficiência e a outros grupos socialmente vulneráveis.
Concordo com a transformação do objectivo de cooperação territorial num dos pilares da política de coesão na Comunidade assim que seja necessário, do ponto de vista do melhoramento das sinergias entre territórios vizinhos que naturalmente têm as mesmas necessidades e problemas, no intuito de melhorar as capacidades e aumentar os meios do intercâmbio político, económico e administrativo entre as regiões vizinhas.
Concordo com a votação por maioria qualificada invertida que reforça o papel da Comissão Europeia ao exigir ao Conselho uma maioria qualificada para derrogar a decisão da Comissão. Acho muito importante o diálogo económico aqui previsto e a evidente e necessária ligação com o semestre europeu.
Concordo com as alterações apresentadas à proposta inicialmente apresentada pela Comissão e que geraram uma maioria alargada de apoio no Parlamento Europeu.
Concordo com as medidas e com as boas práticas propostas pelo senhor deputado Miroslav Mikolášik, e acredito que a proposta de aplicação mais ampla de indicadores fundamentais é particularmente útil, assim como a preparação de relatórios sobre os resultados e sinergias entre as políticas nacionais e as políticas da União Europeia.
Concordo com o alargamento do âmbito de aplicação da proposta de regulamento sobre o transporte rodoviário profissional transfronteiriço de notas e moedas de euro entre os Estados-Membros da área do euro ao território dos Estados-Membros que estão em vias de aderir à zona euro.
Concordo com o apelo feito pelo Parlamento Europeu para que a Comissão elabore um manual europeu sobre governação a vários níveis e encoraje os Estados-Membros a segui-lo, levando em conta os objectivos específicos locais e regionais, de forma a alargar a aplicação das medidas de governação da política de coesão (ou seja, a programação, o financiamento e a implementação com base na parceria nacional, regional e local) e para as aplicar a fundos que serão incluídos no quadro estratégico comum planeado, a fim de garantir uma maior eficácia das despesas públicas.
Concordo com o aumento do esforço de redução de 20 para 25%, em que os 5% adicionais correspondem a um incremento em matéria de eficiência energética.
Concordo com o pedido efectuado à Comissão para assegurar a rápida certificação do EGNOS para a aviação civil. Já frisei diversas vezes que sou um entusiasta do conceito de Céu Único Europeu e do programa de Investigação sobre a Gestão do Tráfego Aéreo no Céu Único Europeu.
Concordo com o relator em que deve ser atribuído à política de coesão, que provou a sua eficácia, um lugar no novo Quadro Financeiro Plurianual que seja proporcional à sua importância.
Concordo com o relator na afirmação de que a política de coesão, incluindo a Agenda Europeia, deve procurar alcançar o objectivo de superar as disparidades territoriais investindo no desenvolvimento urbano inteligente com o propósito de elevar o nível de qualidade das infra-estruturas e serviços urbanos. A Comissão Europeia e o Banco Europeu de Investimento (BEI) desenvolveram três instrumentos financeiros, um dos quais visa proporcionar um apoio de governação conjunta para um desenvolvimento sustentável nas zonas urbanas (isto é, o Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas, ou JESSICA - Apoio comunitário conjunto para um investimento sustentável nas zonas urbanas). Com o objectivo de cobrir as necessidades territoriais específicas, é aconselhável coordenar da melhor maneira possível as oportunidades de financiamento aos níveis regional, nacional e da UE.
Concordo com o relator quando afirma que as notações de crédito não constituem apenas simples opiniões e que as ANC devem ser responsabilizadas pelas suas notações. Por conseguinte, a sua responsabilidade civil deve ser aumentada de forma a fornecer uma ameaça credível.
Concordo com o relator quando afirma que é necessário reforçar a responsabilização democrática do conjunto da política de desenvolvimento da UE e o papel activo que o Parlamento Europeu deve ter na aprovação dos fundos destinados à ajuda ao desenvolvimento, com base no artigo 290.º do Tratado de Lisboa.
Concordo com o relator relativamente à necessidade de o Parlamento acompanhar o processo desde o início e de participar activamente nos temas em discussão, para ficar a conhecer o actual estado das negociações relativas aos acordos aéreos. A Comissão deverá ter igualmente conhecimento dos critérios que o Parlamento utilizará para avaliar os diferentes acordos e os respectivos elementos.
Concordo com o relatório quando este apoia a abordagem da Comissão e torna extensivo o uso do mecanismo de votação invertida por maioria qualificada para bloquear uma decisão da Comissão no Conselho. O objectivo do Parlamento tem de ser impedir o método intergovernamental de ser utilizado, mas há que analisar a questão sob um ponto de vista abrangente e, sem enfraquecer o regulamento, encontrar soluções para assegurar que a independência da Comissão é garantida e que o Parlamento pode ser um actor e não meramente um espectador do processo, alcançando um acordo recíproco com o Conselho.
Concordo com o relatório quando este refere que os Estados-Membros devem aproveitar os Fundos Estruturais para apoiar os objectivos da investigação, desenvolvimento e inovação (I&D&I) que visam dar resposta aos desafios societais, com o objectivo de aumentar a prosperidade na Europa. É igualmente imperioso reforçar a cooperação transfronteiriça, assim como incentivar os cidadãos a criarem empresas inovadoras.
Concordo com o senhor deputado relativamente ao apoio e às questões relacionadas com a dívida. É por isso que estamos em conversações com os países com os quais esses Estados mantêm esse tipo de relação, e é também por isso que estamos a debater o assunto com a Comissão.
Concordo com os meus colegas que salientaram a necessidade de sermos muito claros e objectivos quando dialogamos com os nossos parceiros da Parceria Oriental. Não devemos acreditar que podemos limitar-nos a criticar a Bielorrússia, uma vez que existem problemas graves no Azerbaijão e em vários outros países da Parceria Oriental, e espero que o estudo encomendado pela Subcomissão dos Direitos do Homem forneça algumas orientações sobre como devemos abordar a questão dos direitos humanos junto destes países.
Concordo com os objectivos do relatório. É essencial garantir um elevado nível de protecção dos consumidores nos 27 Estados-Membros e, ao mesmo tempo, ter em devida conta a necessidade de os fabricantes, independentemente da sua dimensão, fornecerem os seus bens e serviços aos consumidores europeus sem ter de enfrentar obstáculos jurídicos desnecessários.
Concordo com todos os argumentos do relatório: é importante que os Estados-Membros e a União arquem com a responsabilidade por medidas destinadas a apoiar a aprendizagem na primeira infância, mas devem assumir um papel que não pode ser atribuído apenas aos pais ou aos profissionais do sector da educação. Como defendo sempre nas reuniões da Comissão dos Direitos da Mulher e da Igualdade dos Géneros, pais que vivem na pobreza significam filhos criados na pobreza.
Concordo com todos os senhores deputados que referiram a enorme importância de demonstrarmos ao povo grego que não propomos apenas cortes e austeridade, mas que há uma luz ao fundo do túnel e que podemos efectivamente ajudar a Grécia a regressar ao caminho do crescimento.
Concordo consigo, a parte técnica da história até funcionou. O alerta rápido, o acompanhamento e a localização funcionaram. Há que ter em conta, porém, o lado da comunicação, e este foi uma desgraça, antes de mais na Alemanha, claro, onde diferentes institutos, autoridades e até alguns ministros enviaram sinais divergentes. A Ministra da Agricultura fez uma declaração descabelada no sentido de que as pessoas deviam "deixar de comer produtos crus", embora não tenha qualquer autoridade na matéria.
Concordo consigo. Não é de todo satisfatório, mas assumi a presidência às 19H40, não sou portanto responsável pelo atraso.
Concordo em que deveria ser garantido o equilíbrio adequado entre um alto nível de protecção do consumidor e a simplificação do quadro regulamentar relativo aos produtos têxteis.
Concordo em que, para concretizar plenamente a emblemática iniciativa da Estratégia "Europa 2020” designada "Agenda para Novas Qualificações e Novos Empregos”, é necessário que as instituições da UE cheguem a um acordo sobre uma iniciativa mais pragmática, abrangente e alargada, que seja apoiada por todos os Estados-Membros e se concentre na ligação entre, por um lado, os sectores do ensino profissional, das qualificações profissionais, da aprendizagem ao longo da vida, e dos estágios profissionais, e, por outro, o mercado de trabalho.
Concordo igualmente com a chamada de atenção para princípios de planeamento estratégico e a necessidade de um inter-financiamento mais flexível entre FEDER e FSE.
Concordo igualmente com a solicitação dirigida à Comissão para que proceda a um estudo de impacto detalhado sobre os custos, os benefícios e a potencial estrutura de governação de uma Fundação Europeia de Notação de Crédito totalmente independente, que estenderia a sua competência aos três sectores de notação.
Concordo igualmente com as propostas no sentido de que tanto as instituições da UE como os Estados-Membros se pautem por estes princípios quando elaboram legislação nova ou revêem a já existente. É alarmante constatar que a aplicação do "Small Business Act" se está a deparar com muitos obstáculos nos Estados-Membros, apesar de os exemplos de diversos países mostrarem que a aplicação destes princípios dá bons resultados.
Concordo inteiramente com a afirmação de que o medo e a desconfiança são maus conselheiros; os líderes europeus não devem deixar-se guiar por essas emoções nas reuniões de amanhã e depois de amanhã. O meu lema, que é também o da Presidência húngara, é o de que todos os nossos passos têm de assentar na confiança - diria mesmo na confiança mútua -, na assunção de responsabilidades e na solidariedade, tal como nos foi hoje aqui recomendado.
Concordo inteiramente com o senhor deputado Caspary que as nossas negociações sejam conduzidas rapidamente.
Concordo plenamente com as afirmações eloquentes da minha colega Renate Weber: considero de facto curioso que membros da mesma orientação política que o partido Fidesz, no poder na Hungria, acusem os críticos dessa Constituição de terem motivações políticas.
Concordo plenamente com o prazo proposto pela Comissão relativamente a tornar a faixa dos 800 MHz disponível para serviços de comunicações electrónicas até 1 de Janeiro de 2013.
Concordo plenamente que as recomendações do Grupo Consultivo dos Serviços Jurídicos do Parlamento Europeu, do Conselho e da Comissão devem ser levadas em conta, pois considero que a proposta em questão deve limitar-se simplesmente a uma codificação pura e simples dos textos existentes, sem qualquer alteração substancial.
Concordo plenamente que não se trata apenas, ou principalmente, de uma questão do sector da pecuária.
Concordo que a UE deve desempenhar um papel proactivo na construção de uma Organização das Nações Unidas que possa contribuir para soluções globais, para a paz e a segurança, para a democracia e para uma ordem internacional baseada no Estado de direito.
Concordo que a solução ideal seria uma abordagem de harmonização total, tal como proposta inicialmente pela Comissão e solicitada por várias esferas empresariais, porém infelizmente tal abordagem ainda não é exequível nesta fase...
Concordo que deve existir uma preocupação crescente pelas provas de transmissão à população humana, para quem a eficácia de outrora de muitos antibióticos diminuiu significativamente, colocando assim a saúde humana em risco.
Concordo que esse relatório deve avaliar, nomeadamente: a eficácia do regulamento, os progressos registados no sentido de garantir uma coordenação mais estreita das políticas económicas e uma convergência sustentada dos comportamentos das economias dos Estados-Membros, nos termos do Tratado.
Concordo que o Comité Económico e Financeiro, o Comité de Política Económica, o Comité do Emprego e o Comité da Protecção Social deverão ser consultados no âmbito do Semestre sempre que tal se afigure adequado e que as partes interessadas relevantes, em especial os parceiros sociais, deverão ser envolvidas no âmbito do Semestre quanto às principais questões políticas, se for caso disso, nos termos do TFUE e das disposições legais e políticas nacionais.
Concordo que precisamos de mais tempo para avaliar o impacto de alguns requisitos de etiquetagem adicionais, em especial, no que diz respeito à origem, aos métodos de tratamento e à introdução de um sistema de tamanhos harmonizado. É por isso que o estudo realizado pela Comissão assinala o primeiro passo em frente.
Concordo que quem produz os resíduos tenha de suportar os custos da sua gestão. Essa medida dará um incentivo adequado para que os intervenientes no mercado reduzam as quantidades de resíduos radioactivos e os giram de forma eficiente.
Concordo que uma maior integração das comissões do Parlamento Europeu nesses trabalhos pode ser útil para uma avaliação de impacto de maior qualidade.
Concordo que urge levar a cabo um debate político amplo e abrangente sobre o nível de ambição desejado (decidindo sobre o nível de serviços prestados) e os recursos financeiros disponíveis (em que será necessário fazer uma opção política entre um programa financiado exclusivamente pela UE e um programa que admita contribuições nacionais ou privadas). O resultado deste debate reflectir-se-á nas opções políticas relativas aos futuros sistemas de governação e de gestão dos sistemas de GNSS.
Concordo que é necessário efectuar uma revisão profunda dos princípios de orçamentação, para que, no futuro, os fundos destinados ao orçamento da UE sejam colectados a partir dos recursos próprios. É também urgentemente necessário considerar mecanismos de financiamento inovadores, como um imposto sobre as transacções financeiras, que dêem um contributo significativo para o financiamento do orçamento da UE.
Concordo também com a ideia de que os novos investimentos não devem ser feitos exclusivamente na economia e em sectores específicos; em vez disso, defenderia a necessária implementação de projectos que em grande medida visam a coesão social e a integração das partes.
Concordo também com o relator em que atribuir 1% das despesas da PAC para a florestação não é suficiente. O nosso Parlamento pretende aumentar o número de hectares de floresta na Irlanda ao longo dos próximos anos, pelo que um aumento do financiamento através de PAC seria, certamente, sensato e compensador.
Concordo também que devam ser eliminadas as preferências aplicáveis a quaisquer produtos que causem, ou ameacem causar, graves dificuldades a produtores da União de produtos similares ou directamente concorrentes, tal como determinado por um inquérito realizado pela Comissão. Podemos também concordar com mecanismos destinados a estabelecer uma vigilância aduaneira sobre as importações abrangidas pelo regulamento, ligados aos relatórios trimestrais.
Concordo, em particular, com a afirmação do relator de que as sinergias e a coordenação não implicam soluções universais, requerendo, sim, uma estreita coordenação estratégica entre instrumentos, políticas e intervenientes, a fim de produzir intervenções e programas cuidadosamente concebidos, que tenham em conta as especificidades territoriais e as vantagens comparativas ou as características especiais de cada região numa abordagem integrada de base territorial.
Concordo, pois, com a posição do relator, nomeadamente quanto às recomendações em relação à necessidade de simplificar os mecanismos de acesso aos fundos, tornando os procedimentos mais simples e transparentes e facilitando a actividade das PME.
Concordo, pois, com as recomendações do relator no sentido da elaboração de um planeamento financeiro exaustivo e integrado de modo a que os fundos sejam aplicados em projectos que visem a concretização dos objectivos estabelecidos na Estratégia UE 2020 e não em acções que se limitam a consumir esses mesmos fundos.
Concordo, portanto, com a tese principal do relatório Simpson sobre acordos aéreos internacionais, hoje aqui aprovado. O Parlamento Europeu devia ter participado nas negociações desde o início ou, pelo menos, ter sido informado sobre a evolução das mesmas.
Concordo. Não me falta, de modo algum, ambição em termos do que a Europa pode ser, mas aquilo com que tenho de lidar é a realidade do que efectivamente somos. Nós aprovámos um Tratado e eu gracejei, dizendo que depois de aprovado, mo entregaram, juntamente com um lápis, e que foi com esses recursos que comecei.
Concorre para uma democracia pujante e duradoura. O intercâmbio nas áreas da cultura e da educação favorece a emergência de uma sociedade civil organizada. A cooperação cultural é também uma das chaves do êxito da União para o Mediterrâneo.
Concretamente, podemos ver que a UE não dispõe de quaisquer linhas eléctrica com capacidade para transportar electricidade suficiente de Norte para Sul ou de Leste para Oeste. É do conhecimento geral que nem sempre existe vento, nem mesmo na Alemanha do Norte, e que os painéis solares, que têm actualmente uma eficiência de cerca de 11%, apenas conseguem converter a energia solar que captam em corrente eléctrica.
Condenei a violência e solicitei a realização de uma investigação - uma investigação que tem de ser exaustiva e independente e que deve esclarecer o que aconteceu.
Condenámos explicitamente a deterioração desta situação e instámos repetidamente a que se ponha cobro à repressão actual da oposição política e da sociedade civil, a que se libertem todos os prisioneiros e se cancelem os julgamentos de motivação política.
Confesso que não consigo compreender a ênfase colocada na necessidade de aumentar o poder e os recursos das acções comuns e da Agência Europeia de Defesa: dados os precedentes, não gostaria que também ela se tornasse uma máquina burocrática inútil que constitua um fim em si própria e que as suas acções se tornassem totalmente ineficazes.
Confiamos que estaremos aptos a prosseguir o nosso diálogo aberto e transparente em Quieve e em Bruxelas sobre as reformas internas na Ucrânia e sobre a interligação mais estreita do país com a UE, tanto com as autoridades ucranianas como com a oposição. Muito obrigado.
Confiamos também em que a Comissão respeite escrupulosamente o compromisso do Considerando 6-A, que envolve o Parlamento, ao lado do Conselho, em futuros processos de revisão. A interpretação também não será automática, mas inteligente através de in-depth reviews, que são exigentes para a Comissão, mas necessárias.
Confiar reciprocamente nos sistemas de certificação da outra parte significa reforçar a segurança do sistema, poupando tempo que, de outro modo, seria gasto com a duplicação de todas as avaliações efectuadas pela autoridade exportadora e garantindo benefícios para as companhias de aviação, graças à possibilidade de utilizar os recursos de reparação e manutenção um do outro.
Confiemos no nosso Comissário, e estou convicta de que teremos testes que serão rigorosos e passíveis de nos tranquilizar.
Confirma-se com este relatório a concepção de cultura vigente na União Europeia: uma visão instrumental da cultura, considerando-a ao serviço da política externa, através do conceito de diplomacia cultural.
Confirmo a minha concordância com a participação da Croácia nas actividades do Observatório, pois, tendo em conta a integração deste país numa rota de trânsito de drogas ilícitas devido à sua posição geográfica estratégica, creio que a adopção do programa europeu conduzirá à melhoria da saúde e da paz social, não só a nível europeu, mas também mundial.
Conforme foi referido em diversas ocasiões, desde 2006 que o FEG proporciona apoio prático aos trabalhadores europeus que foram despedidos por motivos relacionados com a deslocalização da sua empresa ou, após a alteração de 2009, em consequência da crise económica.
Conforme já foi mencionado por vários deputados, o meu Grupo também se opõe firmemente à abordagem da Comissão de usar o acordo para forçar a liberalização de serviços através de uma "lista negativa”, o que inverte completamente a abordagem seguida até agora em que as partes contratantes definem as áreas que querem activamente abrir.
Conforme muitos referiram aqui, hoje, temos motivo para nos sentirmos indignados. Não só utilizamos produtos que esgotam e prejudicam o meio ambiente e depois, quando já não os queremos, somos incapazes de os tratar de forma adequada, como depositamos resíduos perigosos que prejudicam a saúde de pessoas inocentes, frequentemente crianças, e tornam a terra e a água noutros países tóxicos para as gerações vindouras.
Conforme referi na minha declaração introdutória, estamos actualmente a executar um projecto-piloto, a pedido do Parlamento, para converter o trabalho precário em emprego digno, e já foram lançados dois convites à apresentação de propostas. O segundo convite, lançado no início deste ano, constitui especificamente uma exortação para que se tomem medidas de reforço dos direitos dos trabalhadores mais pobres, e será igualmente realizado um estudo para melhor compreensão do fenómeno do trabalho precário.
Conforme referido por muitas pessoas, incluindo a Comissão, precisamos de algum tipo de clarificação e de simplificação relativamente às regras que efectivamente se aplicam às transferências de resíduos tóxicos para os países em desenvolvimento, para que a polícia e outros agentes que efectuam o controlo nas fronteiras possam, com maior facilidade, tomar medidas de combate aos crimes contra o ambiente que a exportação de resíduos perigosos efectivamente representa.
Conforme referimos a respeito da aplicação do sistema global de navegação por satélite europeu aos transportes, a utilização desta tecnologia pode representar um importante contributo para o desenvolvimento, a modernização e a diversificação de serviços públicos, na criação de oportunidades de cooperação e de avanço na ciência e suas aplicações, na troca e acessibilidade à informação, com a garantia do respeito pelos direitos, liberdades e garantias dos cidadãos. A questão que se coloca, porém, não é a da existência de um sistema global de navegação por satélite para a Europa tendo por base a sua utilização para fins não militares e não integrados nas orientações securitárias da UE.
Conforme se refere no relatório, a UE goza de uma boa reputação a nível mundial no que respeita à relação óptima entre dinamismo económico e um modelo social, o que acarreta alguma responsabilidade. A UE já não se pode permitir actuar com duplicidade de critérios, razão por que estou totalmente de acordo com o relator.
Conforme vão sendo alterados, torna-se complicado perceber quais as disposições que se mantêm em vigor. A codificação constitui igualmente uma forma adequada de desenvolver legislação comunitária mais simples, mais clara e mais compreensível para os cidadãos
Confrontados com os desafios do envelhecimento da população e da globalização da nossa economia, devemos incentivar o desenvolvimento de programas de formação ao longo da vida, em particular através do intercâmbio de boas práticas entre os Estados-Membros, e melhorar a formação inicial dos jovens europeus, promovendo parcerias entre as universidades, os centros de investigação e as empresas.
Confrontados como somos com bem mais do que 400 petições, como referido na resolução, encontramo-nos a debater esta questão mais uma vez nesta Assembleia.
Confrontamo-nos repetidamente com o problema de, quando fazemos perguntas à Comissão enquanto os assuntos em questão estão em desenvolvimento, obtermos uma resposta deste tipo: "Partimos do princípio de que o Estado-Membro X está a executar e aplicar adequadamente as directivas e os regulamentos já existentes na União Europeia. Não vemos necessidade de intervir". Precisamos de um instrumento que possamos utilizar para encetar um diálogo sério com os Estados-Membros enquanto os assuntos em questão estão em desenvolvimento, caso haja indicações de que algo está a decorrer de forma errada; isto para não acabarmos na mesma situação do caso que temos em mãos. As coisas não decorreram optimamente, mas o que está feito está feito e temos uma solução para o futuro - para o passado, não, infelizmente.
Congratulamo-nos com a nomeação do senhor Mario Draghi para o cargo de futuro Presidente do Banco Central Europeu (BCE), uma vez que ele demonstrou possuir um perfil profissional à altura deste cargo de prestígio, assim como uma experiência longa e reconhecida no sector financeiro e bancário internacional.
Congratulamo-nos com o facto de os deputados ao PE terem demonstrado claramente a sua determinação neste sentido na perspectiva do debate que se aproxima sobre o futuro financiamento da UE. A UE necessita de um sistema adequado e previsível para financiar o seu próprio orçamento, a fim de pôr termo à eterna e prejudicial discussão sobre as contribuições nacionais para o orçamento da UE. A introdução de um sistema de "recursos próprios" verdadeiro e eficaz para financiar o orçamento da UE é a única forma de alcançar este objectivo e estamos satisfeitos por o PE ter apoiado esta prioridade de longa data dos Verdes.
Congratulamo-nos com o facto de se ter chegado a acordo e estamos bastante orgulhosos com o resultado; no entanto, devo dizer que não estamos contentes com todos os aspectos.
Congratulei-me com este importante documento porque, através do Regulamento (CE) n.º 2007/2000, a União Europeia concedeu um acesso excepcional ilimitado ao mercado comunitário, com isenção de direitos, para a quase totalidade dos produtos originários dos países e territórios que beneficiam do Processo de Estabilização e de Associação. O principal objectivo destas medidas consiste em revitalizar as economias dos Balcãs Ocidentais através de um acesso privilegiado ao mercado comunitário.
Congratulo-me bastante com o facto de ele apoiar a proposta negociada pela comissão porque se trata realmente de um compromisso bastante bom entre vários pontos de vista: um compromisso entre o ponto de vista da Comissão e as opiniões apresentadas pelos Estados-Membros, por um lado e, por outro, é compatível com os interesses dos investidores, mas acima de tudo abre boas perspectivas futuras para a política de investimento da União, servindo a União como um todo. É muito importante que estejamos a criar um novo sistema, começando por estabelecer uma sólida base jurídica criada pelos acordos actualmente em vigor e que foram negociados pelos Estados-Membros de modo a estabelecer finalmente um sistema de protecção comum a toda a União Europeia. É importante que a resolução que será votada amanhã seja rapidamente acordada com o Conselho.
Congratulo-me com a adopção da Resolução do Parlamento Europeu sobre a Análise do "Small Business Act”, que adapta as medidas de apoio da UE às pequenas e médias empresas (PME) ao novo contexto resultante da crise económica de 2008 e assegura que tais medidas são suficientes para o cumprimento das metas da estratégia "Europa 2020”. As PME foram as primeiras a ser afectadas pela crise financeira e bancária que se tem vindo a fazer sentir ao longo destes últimos anos e que reduziu o acesso destas empresas ao financiamento e aos mercados.
Congratulo-me com a adopção deste relatório, que reclama um reforço do papel da União Europeia nas estruturas das organizações multilaterais (sistema das Nações Unidas, instituições financeiras internacionais, Organização do Tratado do Atlântico Norte (NATO), Organização para a Segurança e a Cooperação na Europa (OSCE), Organização Mundial do Comércio (OMC), e assim sucessivamente).
Congratulo-me com a adopção do relatório Casini sobre a criação de um registo comum em matéria de transparência entre o Parlamento e a Comissão. A introdução de um registo público ao qual os grupos de interesses terão de aderir para terem acesso a estas duas instituições constituintes representa um genuíno progresso democrático em benefício dos cidadãos. Neste contexto, a futura obrigatoriedade para os relatores de tornarem públicos os nomes dos grupos de interesses com quem mantiveram contactos constitui mais um passo em direcção à total independência do Parlamento Europeu, assegurando uma representação equilibrada dos interesses de todos os cidadãos europeus.
Congratulo-me com a aprovação da minha alteração, que "toma nota dos recentes desenvolvimentos no plano jurídico relativamente à abolição de produtos derivados da foca, em particular do pedido formulado pelo Canadá à OMC com vista à criação de um painel oficial de resolução de litígios, e espera veementemente que o Canadá retire a queixa apresentada na OMC, que contraria as relações comerciais positivas, antes que seja necessário o Parlamento Europeu ratificar o acordo económico e comercial global”.
Congratulo-me com a aprovação desta Directiva, que constitui um passo em frente da construção europeia e na protecção dos direitos dos consumidores, mas, ao mesmo tempo, lamento que a aprovação de vários artigos da Directiva implique a retirada da protecção de muitos consumidores e utentes espanhóis que se vão ver privados de certos direitos que já estavam consagrados na lei espanhola.
Congratulo-me com a aprovação deste relatório, que contou com o meu apoio, não só pelas medidas correctivas que aponta, mas também pela arquitectura da futura política de coesão que sugere.
Congratulo-me com a aprovação do relatório Audy sobre a avaliação intercalar do Sétimo Programa-Quadro, tendo em conta o impacto da recente crise económica, que afectou em particular a capacidade das pequenas e médias empresas em investir em investigação e desenvolvimento.
Congratulo-me com a criação e desenvolvimento do Small Business Act, que, na minha opinião, providencia oportunamente soluções para os principais obstáculos sentidos pelas PME no que se refere à expansão de actividades e inserção no mercado.
Congratulo-me com a importância atribuída à garantia de que está disponível o necessário espectro radioeléctrico para vigiar a atmosfera e a superfície da Terra, permitindo assim o desenvolvimento e a utilização das aplicações espaciais e a melhoria dos sistemas de transportes, sobretudo para o Galileo e os sistemas GMS, bem como para a segurança inteligente e os sistemas de gestão do sector dos transportes.
Congratulo-me com a iniciativa da Comissão Juventude em Movimento e com o facto de aquela instituição não ter esquecido os jovens. O investimento em educação é a solução para os problemas perenes da UE, mesmo em época de apertar o cinto.
Congratulo-me com a intenção da Comissão Europeia de garantir mais recursos para o reforço da liberdade, da segurança e do direito no projecto de orçamento para o próximo ano.
Congratulo-me com a participação da República da Croácia no Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência (OEDT). A principal tarefa do OEDT consiste em recolher dados sobre a droga e a toxicodependência, para elaborar e publicar informações objectivas, fiáveis e comparáveis a nível europeu. A informação destina-se a proporcionar uma base para analisar a procura de drogas e as formas de a reduzir, bem como, de um modo geral, os fenómenos associados ao mercado da droga.
Congratulo-me com a presente resolução, que salienta os progressos nas negociações para um acordo comercial entre a UE e o Canadá. O Canadá é um potencial parceiro comercial importante para a UE e ambas as partes lucrarão com o referido acordo.
Congratulo-me com a proposta de que a Europa deve criar a sua própria agência de notação de crédito, que produziria avaliações objectivas e independentes, tal como já defendi em várias ocasiões. Acolho com agrado o apelo do relatório à criação de uma Agência Europeia de Notação de Risco, que, de acordo com as propostas, seria inicialmente designada Fundação Europeia de Notação de Crédito.
Congratulo-me com a proposta do relator de simplificação dos procedimentos de financiamento e de adopção de uma abordagem mais orientada para o desempenho, bem como de adopção de critérios de "excelência” e "valor acrescentado europeu” nas despesas da UE. O sector da investigação poderá assegurar a obtenção do máximo valor acrescentado para a União. Os orçamentos públicos sofreram cortes e, neste contexto, deve mobilizar-se financiamento privado para o Oitavo Programa-Quadro de investigação. Portanto, aprova a proposta do relator de aumentar a participação dos grupos industriais e das pequenas e médias empresas.
Congratulo-me com a proposta do senhor deputado Leinen e votei a favor. A política europeia em matéria de ambiente está a tornar-se cada vez mais importante à luz da crise económica e da Estratégia UE 2020, e só é possível uma avaliação séria dessa política mediante dados fiáveis.
Congratulo-me com a renovação do Protocolo ao Acordo de Parceria UE-São Tomé por ser um acordo mutuamente vantajoso para a UE e São Tomé no que se refere aos seus interesses no sector da pesca. O Acordo de Pesca com São Tomé e Príncipe pode contribuir para apoiar a viabilidade do sector atuneiro da UE no oceano Atlântico, proporcionando aos navios e aos sectores da União Europeia que dele dependem um quadro jurídico estável a médio prazo e contribuindo para manter a continuidade das zonas de pesca abrangidas por acordos no golfo da Guiné
Congratulo-me com a votação deste relatório. O reforço dos regulamentos em matéria de segurança nuclear era essencial por várias razões. Uma delas é, evidentemente, o grave acidente nuclear no Japão. No entanto, também me congratulo com esse reforço porque, actualmente, os chamados resíduos radioactivos "de actividade elevada e de vida longa" continuam a ser armazenados de uma forma provisória. O combustível irradiado é normalmente armazenado em condições de segurança nas proximimidades dos reactores, mas há que reconhecer que, para efeitos de armazenagem permanente, os níveis de segurança deviam ser muito mais elevados.
Congratulo-me com esta iniciativa do Parlamento, porque o amplo consenso entre os grupos políticos no sentido de se iniciar um debate sobre as pequenas e médias empresas ilustra o papel crucial que detêm enquanto motor de crescimento na UE. A recessão torna ainda mais difícil para as pequenas e médias empresas financiarem-se. Urge melhorar o seu acesso aos mercados, ao financiamento e à informação. É imperativo limitar os encargos administrativos através de uma simplificação do ambiente regulamentar. A nível europeu, importa combater a economia paralela e dar incentivos às pequenas e médias empresas. A Comissão anunciou recentemente 12 acções para 2012 para estimular o mercado único, designadamente medidas para financiamento das PME e a mobilidade de trabalhadores, medidas que - segundo creio - constituem um passo na direcção certa.
Congratulo-me com esta iniciativa e com a proposta da Comissão Europeia porque permitirão ajudar a melhorar o nosso conhecimento sobre as emissões atmosféricas, os impostos ambientais, etc.
Congratulo-me com esta resolução sobre as perspectivas futuras para as agências de notação de crédito. O sector da notação de crédito conhece frequentemente problemas relacionados com estruturas oligopolistas e falta de concorrência, responsabilização e transparência.
Congratulo-me com este acordo e com a participação da República da Croácia nas actividades do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência. O consumo e o tráfico de drogas ilícitas são fenómenos mundiais que ameaçam a saúde e a estabilidade social.
Congratulo-me com este relatório, que salienta que o PIB é um indicador da actividade económica do mercado que se tornou um parâmetro de referência normalizado ao serviço dos responsáveis políticos no mundo inteiro; insiste que o PIB é uma medida da produção e não mede a sustentabilidade ambiental, a eficiência dos recursos, a inclusão social e o progresso social em geral; sublinha, além disso, que o PIB pode induzir em erro, no sentido em que as medidas correctivas tomadas na sequência de certos incidentes, como acidentes e catástrofes naturais, são consideradas benefícios e não custos; observa que, para além das medições do desenvolvimento económico e da produtividade, existem outros indicadores que influenciam e explicam os níveis de vida de um país e que permanecem por quantificar, apesar de existirem indicadores aplicáveis; salienta a necessidade de desenvolver outros indicadores para medir o pleno impacto da actividade económica.
Congratulo-me com o Livro Verde da Comissão sobre a protecção das florestas e a informação florestal na UE. Sendo as florestas o principal sumidouro de carbono, a sua gestão sustentável é fundamental para alcançar os objectivos da UE em matéria de alterações climáticas.
Congratulo-me com o apoio claro à estrutura de dois pilares e congratulo-me também com o facto de o senhor Comissário ter hoje afirmado o seu apoio a essa estrutura.
Congratulo-me com o apoio da União à estratégia das Nações Unidas, particularmente nod domínios da política humanitária e da resolução de conflitos. A Europa e a ONU têm inúmeros objectivos e interesses em comum, o que, na minha opinião, justifica uma cooperação ainda mais estreita e sinergias de recursos.
Congratulo-me com o enfoque dado neste relatório à investigação e inovação como formas de superar a crise económica e social que a Europa actualmente atravessa.
Congratulo-me com o facto de a relatora compreender isso. O financiamento do FSE pode ter um valor inestimável, ajudando a proporcionar formação a grupos desfavorecidos da sociedade lituana.
Congratulo-me com o facto de o Parlamento se ter oposto a este tipo de armazenagem de resíduos em regiões sísmicas, e com o reforço das competências das autoridades nacionais.
Congratulo-me com o facto de o acesso aos contratos a nível do governo federal indiano ser um assunto abrangido pelas negociações em apreço, mas, e os contratos a nível das províncias?
Congratulo-me com o facto de o documento em apreço não pensar a inclusão dos jovens apenas na perspectiva do emprego, mas também pelo prisma da educação e da formação. A este respeito, gostaria de salientar a solicitação à Comissão Europeia, que apoio, de que apresente um Livro Verde sobre a Participação dos jovens.
Congratulo-me com o facto de o relatório hoje aprovado determinar que as avaliações de impacto devem ser realizadas de forma totalmente independente; que têm de levar em devida consideração uma vasta gama de critérios (de natureza socioeconómica, ambiental, etc.) e também com o facto de instituir a garantia de maior transparência, em particular quando haja envolvimento de especialistas externos. É uma matéria recorrente nesta Câmara, mas que não deixa de ser altamente importante!
Congratulo-me com o facto de o relatório sobre as dimensões culturais das acções externas da UE, onde se afirma que a cultura deve estar no centro da diplomacia europeia, ter sido aprovado.
Congratulo-me com o facto de poder afirmar que o relatório hoje aqui apresentado teve origem numa excelente cooperação com os relatores-sombra, os senhores deputados Trautmann, Rohde, Chichester e Lamberts, que apoiaram a proposta.
Congratulo-me com o facto de um número tão elevado das nossas exigências ter sido incluído no relatório final da Comissão da Indústria, da Investigação e da Energia.
Congratulo-me com o interesse demonstrado em relação ao potencial das indústrias culturais e criativas.
Congratulo-me com o que o relatório diz sobre o reconhecimento da importância da floresta em termos socioeconómicos e ecológicos e insto a Comissão a adoptar uma abordagem coerente que ajude este sector a alcançar o seu pleno potencial.
Congratulo-me com o relatório do senhor deputado Coelho e com a sua proposta sobre a necessidade de a Bulgária adoptar medidas adicionais, preparando um plano de acção especial com a Grécia e a Turquia devido ao problema da imigração ilegal na fronteira greco-búlgara.
Congratulo-me com o texto em apreço porque o sector das notações de crédito padece de diversos problemas, dos quais os mais graves são as estruturas oligopolistas e a falta de concorrência, responsabilização e transparência.
Congratulo-me com o trabalho desempenhado com base no Fundo Europeu de Ajustamento à Globalização, nomeadamente no apoio à indústria automóvel afectada pela crise económica e financeira.
Congratulo-me com o trabalho realizado, que também possibilita a adopção de instrumentos que encaminharão a agricultura na direcção de um desenvolvimento mais sustentável, tendo em conta os objectivos de segurança alimentar, meio ambiente, territórios e empregos. A "ecologização" dos pagamentos do primeiro pilar permitirá igualmente incentivar os agricultores a adoptarem boas práticas agrícolas e a serem eficientes do ponto de vista económico e ambiental.
Congratulo-me com os esforços realizados no sentido de melhorar a acção multilateral da Europa, sublinhando a importância de um papel activo e de liderança levado a cabo pela UE na reforma da governação mundial.
Congratulo-me com todos os esforços exercidos no sentido de estreitar e aprofundar boas relações entre a UE e outras potências económicas.
Congratulo-me em especial por neste texto instarmos os Estados-Membros a eliminarem toda e qualquer forma de discriminação em razão da idade em matéria de acesso aos regimes de segurança social.
Congratulo-me igualmente com a nomeação de um homem que tem todas as qualidades necessárias para exercer o cargo. A sua experiência no Conselho Europeu de Estabilidade Financeira e como governador do Banco de Itália constituem activos importantes para a visibilidade da instituição a nível internacional, bem como para o estatuto da União Europeia como maior potência económica mundial.
Congratulo-me igualmente com as propostas no sentido da manutenção do equilíbrio territorial na UE. Estou satisfeita com o apoio expresso no relatório aos jovens que enveredam por uma carreira na agricultura, pois considero essencial combatermos o despovoamento das zonas rurais. É importante mantermos o apoio às regiões desfavorecidas e a possibilidade de pagamentos baseados na produção nas regiões onde não há alternativas a um determinado tipo de produção. Congratulo-me também por ver atendido o meu pedido de maior flexibilidade no segundo pilar. A situação do sector agrícola difere de Estado para Estado.
Congratulo-me igualmente por esses pagamentos passarem a aplicar-se apenas aos agricultores efectivamente activos no sector, de modo a que os auxílios beneficiem aqueles que de facto necessitam deles e que os utilizam em benefício da agricultura. O relatório propõe também uma distribuição mais equilibrada da ajuda, tendo presente que, por razões históricas, as explorações agrícolas da União Europeia tem estruturas muito diversas.
Congratulo-me pela introdução de um mecanismo financeiro de apoio à gestão destes resíduos de modo a eliminar a sua perigosidade e pela adopção de reguladores mais exigentes que evitem a violação da presente directiva.
Congratulo-me pela proposta de assegurar que a investigação apoiada no âmbito do Sétimo Programa-Quadro visa encontrar soluções para os problemas da UE nas áreas constantes do capítulo para a Cooperação do Sétimo Programa-Quadro.
Congratulo-me pelo facto de as prioridades apresentadas neste relatório estarem de acordo com a Estratégia Europa 2020 e colocarem o crescimento no centro das políticas europeias.
Congratulo-me pelo trabalho deste Parlamento, pelo trabalho daqueles que se deslocaram àquele país e pelas contribuições que recebi. É preciso levar este assunto ao Conselho dos Negócios Estrangeiros e é preciso debater este assunto com o Alto Comissariado das Nações Unidas para os Refugiados. A nossa Embaixadora no Iraque chega hoje, e sabe a importância que atribuo a esta questão. Precisamos de prosseguir e certificar-nos de que encontramos a acção correcta para este caso, mas a investigação e a condenação são imprescindíveis.
Congratulo-me por a senhora deputada Berès ter instado na sua declaração à realização de uma campanha para a criação de condições de trabalho uniformizadas.
Congratulo-me por esta referência ao cristianismo ter sido incluída e gostaria igualmente que fosse incluída no Tratado de Lisboa e na Constituição Europeia. A minha posição, enquanto representante do Partido Popular Europeu (Democratas-Cristãos) é que se trata de um aspecto positivo.
Congratulo-me por o Parlamento, por ocasião desta votação em segunda leitura, ter reintroduzido uma série de alterações, apesar da oposição do Conselho. É importante que os consumidores possam fazer as suas compras com conhecimento pleno dos factos e que não comprem inadvertidamente couros ou peles, como acontece, em particular, quando as peles são usadas como adorno em roupas baratas.
Congratulo-me por o nosso Livro Verde ter gerado, tanto na Europa como nas instituições europeias, um debate enriquecedor sobre o ambiente mais adequado para corresponder às necessidades específicas do empreendedorismo criador a fim de tirar partido das novas oportunidades criadas pela globalização, a digitalização e a diversidade cultural.
Congratulo-me por ser um dos subscritores da presente resolução, que reafirma a importância do respeito pela democracia e os direitos humanos nas relações entre a União Europeia e a Rússia. A começar pelo diálogo sobre direitos humanos entre a Rússia e a UE e continuando com as cimeiras, considero ser necessário adoptar uma abordagem sistemática e franca sempre que o direito a um processo judicial justo não é respeitado ou os activistas dos direitos humanos e os jornalistas são perseguidos e impedidos de fazer o seu trabalho.
Congratulo-me por ver que uma grande maioria deste Parlamento está empenhada em manter um debate sério sobre este tema e em evitar distracções. Continuaremos a acompanhar atentamente a evolução da situação e estamos prontos para reagir em consonância.
Congratulo-me por, finalmente, podermos aprovar uma directiva que codifica a Directiva 86/298/CEE do Conselho, de 26 de Maio de 1986, e aproxima a legislação dos Estados-Membros quanto aos dispositivos de protecção montados na retaguarda dos tractores agrícolas e florestais com rodas de via estreita.
Congratulo-me por, no quadro da Estratégia "Europa 2020”, estarmos a dedicar especial atenção aos jovens, tendo em conta os desafios demográficos que o nosso continente tem de enfrentar.
Congratulo-me também com o apoio do Parlamento à ideia de categorizar algumas zonas como regiões intermédias, a fim de assegurar a promoção do seu desenvolvimento futuro, apesar de se situarem acima do actual critério vinculativo de 75 % do PIB da União Europeia. A introdução desta categoria ajudará regiões que ainda se debatem com muitos desafios de desenvolvimento, apesar de terem excedido a média da UE; num futuro próximo, esta categoria incluirá regiões da Polónia.
Congratulo-me também com o facto de a Comissão - como nos informou oficiosamente - estar a trabalhar na preparação de uma nova proposta a um ritmo acelerado, esforçando-se por manter na nova proposta legislativa o maior número possível de elementos do acordo preliminar obtido nas últimas negociações. A Presidência garante o seu apoio à Comissão e ao Parlamento e espera que surja muito em breve uma oportunidade de aprovar esta nova proposta.
Congratulo-me também com o facto de o Parlamento Europeu ter reafirmado o seu apoio aos recursos próprios, porque é legítimo que a União gira o seu próprio orçamento.
Congratulo-me, além disso, com o facto de o relatório também ter em consideração as regiões cujas condições são especialmente adversas, como as regiões subpovoadas do norte.
Congratulo-me, pois, por finalmente podermos aprovar uma directiva que codifica a Directiva 70/157/CEE do Conselho, de 6 de Fevereiro de 1970, aproximando a legislação dos Estados-Membros no que respeita ao nível sonoro admissível e ao dispositivo de escape dos veículos a motor.
Congratulo-me, pois, por finalmente podermos aprovar uma directiva que codifica a Directiva 86/415/CEE do Conselho, de 24 de Julho de 1986, no que respeita à aproximação da legislação dos Estados-Membros quanto à instalação, colocação e funcionamento dos comandos dos tractores agrícolas ou florestais de rodas.
Congratulo-me, pois, por finalmente podermos aprovar uma directiva que codifica a Directiva 87/402/CEE do Conselho, de 25 de Junho de 1987, no que respeita aos dispositivos de protecção montados à frente, em caso de capotagem, dos tractores agrícolas ou florestais com rodas de via estreita.
Congratulo-me, por conseguinte, pela proposta da Comissão Europeia de criação de uma categoria intermédia para as regiões cujo PIB per capita se situa entre 75% e 90% da média europeia.
Congratulo-me, por isso, com a celebração do presente acordo, o qual, ao tornar obrigatório de facto o registo de todos os lobistas que queiram usufruir de um acesso permanente ao PE e à Comissão, dá um passo decisivo no sentido do reforço da transparência no diálogo entre as instituições comunitárias e estes representantes da sociedade civil.
Congratulo-me, por isso, com a forte mensagem política que o Parlamento enviou neste que é o Ano Internacional das Florestas. Não podemos adoptar uma abordagem do tipo "esperar para ver" relativamente às medidas que têm de ser tomadas para a adaptação às alterações climáticas. É necessário também que reforcemos a Reserva Táctica Europeia de Combate a Incêndios Florestais, dado que nesta área a prevenção é tão importante como a reacção. Para podermos preservar as nossas florestas tal como as conhecemos e amamos, temos de estar na vanguarda da luta, a fim de assegurar a gestão sustentável das áreas florestais e de as proteger das ameaça que sobre elas pairam.
Congratulo-me, por isso, com a participação da Croácia no trabalho do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência, principalmente para efeitos da educação neste domínio e da prevenção do consumo de drogas e de outras substâncias estupefacientes.
Congratulo-me, por isso, com a possibilidade de se ajustarem essas normas em função das condições diversas das explorações. A PAC pode prestar-se à fraude e ao engano, por isso, é também importante identificar os agricultores genuinamente "activos" ao nível europeu, para evitar um desperdício inaceitável de recursos.
Congratulo-me, portanto, com esta iniciativa da Comissão, que se traduz num Livro Verde de informação para a protecção florestal, pois para actuar de forma eficiente é preciso, antes de mais, conhecer os danos sofridos ultimamente pelas nossas florestas devido à nova conjuntura climática global, nomeadamente no que se relaciona com tempestades, aumento de risco de incêndio, pragas e doenças fúngicas.
Congratulo-me, portanto, com um acordo com o Canadá que transcenda os compromissos assumidos no âmbito da OMC e seja complementar às regras multilaterais, contanto que as negociações conduzam a um acordo ambicioso, qualitativamente elevado, baseado na reciprocidade e que vise mais do que meras reduções pautais.
Conhecem o relatório dos Carabinieri italianos do Ministério das Políticas Agrícolas, Alimentares e Florestais sobre quotas leiteiras? Este relatório mostra claramente que a quota de produção leiteira, que é suposto ter sido excedida, configurando, assim, a base jurídica para a aplicação de coimas a produtores de leite italianos, de facto, não foi excedida.
Conheci, por exemplo, uma secretária de uma escola que pagou mais de 2 000 euros porque a escola não tinha capacidade para os pagar e porque se sentia responsável por ter sido ela quem assinara o formulário.
Consagrada no artigo 39°. do Tratado sobre o Funcionamento da União Europeia, a política agrícola comum (PAC) tem como principal objectivo "incrementar a produtividade da agricultura, fomentando o progresso técnico, assegurando o desenvolvimento racional da produção agrícola e a utilização óptima dos factores de produção, designadamente da mão-de-obra". Voto favoravelmente o presente relatório por entender que este contém medidas que fortalecem e garantem a sustentabilidade da PAC pós-2013, contribuindo simultaneamente para alcançar os objectivos consagrados na Estratégia Europa 2020, e tem em linha de conta as diferenças patentes entre os novos e os antigos Estados-Membros.
Conseguem imaginar os partidos políticos da Hungria a organizarem campanhas eleitorais noutros países? Em suma, a nova Constituição húngara conduzirá a uma destabilização total da Europa Central.
Conseguimos ver incluídas neste relatório as nossas principais preocupações, tais como a necessidade de manter uma PAC comunitária e dotada dos meios financeiros adequados- e sublinho esta questão- não admitiremos que sejam retirados meios financeiros para garantir a execução da Política Agrícola Comum, queremos uma mais justa repartição dos apoios entre EstadosMembros e entre agricultores, a introdução de um novo sistema desligado da produção, baseado em critérios de natureza ambiental e de natureza social, isto é, valorizando o emprego, orientar a PAC para aqueles que são verdadeiramente agricultores e criar um mecanismo específico para os pequenos agricultores.
Conseguir conciliar as políticas florestais do sul e do norte da Europa de modo a alcançar uma abordagem coerente em toda a União Europeia é um desafio nada fácil.
Conseguiram também um papel igual para o Parlamento na definição do painel de avaliação para detectar possíveis desequilíbrios macroeconómicos e introduziram garantias firmes no que respeita ao diálogo social, ao respeito das tradições nacionais em acordos colectivos, à formação dos salários e ao papel dos parceiros sociais, que partilhamos inteiramente.
Conseguiremos prevenir e corrigir desequilíbrios orçamentais e económicos, o que constitui uma das melhores garantias de crescimento económico e de emprego.
Conseguiu abordar de forma equilibrada as questões mais prementes respeitantes à organização e às actividades do Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa (SEAE) e questões fundamentais para a política externa e de segurança comum (PESC), como sejam a promoção dos valores da democracia, dos direitos humanos e do Estado de direito, a promoção da igualdade de género e a segurança energética, a situação no Irão e no Afeganistão, a resposta da UE às transformações democráticas na região do Sul do Mediterrâneo e relações com importantes actores como a Rússia, a China, o Japão e a Índia. O relatório estabelece um equilíbrio em matéria de cooperação civil e militar na resolução de crises e em matéria de interacção UE-NATO: por um lado, evita relegar a UE exclusivamente para a esfera das questões comerciais, de desenvolvimento e humanitárias, o rumo seguido pelo Grupo ECR, e, por outro, rejeita a insistência do Grupo GUE/NGL em excluir da PESC qualquer componente militar.
Consequentemente, a Comissão deve estudar a possibilidade de criar uma Fundação Europeia de Notação de Crédito totalmente nova e independente, que teria o direito de participar nas decisões sobre as notações de risco da dívida soberana e sobre as agências de notação de crédito. A estrutura de gestão, de pessoal e de governação da nova Fundação precisa de ser totalmente independente e autónoma.
Consequentemente, a existência de normas para o exercício da representação de interesses é, finalmente, uma questão de legitimidade.
Consequentemente, a fim de poder financiar as medidas associadas às novas competências da UE ao abrigo do Tratado de Lisboa, apoio o pedido de que a questão dos recursos próprios seja examinada e o apelo a novas fontes de rendimento da União, a fim de diminuir a pressão sobre os orçamentos nacionais e de evitar o conceito de "retorno justo”, que é economicamente impreciso e politicamente frágil.
Consequentemente, as disposições previstas na Directiva 2003/37/CE relativa à homologação de tractores agrícolas ou florestais, seus reboques e máquinas intermutáveis rebocadas e dos sistemas, componentes e unidades técnicas destes veículos aplicam-se a esta directiva.
Consequentemente, considero que não podem restar dúvidas quanto ao valor do mandado de detenção europeu.
Consequentemente, espero que a votação de amanhã seja favorável e que todos aqueles que se dizem a favor dos eurotítulos discutam a questão de espírito aberto e não com base em preconceitos ideológicos.
Consequentemente, este relatório de iniciativa do Parlamento deve constituir uma base para discussões futuras, apesar de, a meu ver, exagerar no que respeita ao consenso e à precaução. É verdade que um aumento de 5% no orçamento europeu seria melhor do que os planos orçamentais que os Estados-Membros têm para 2012.
Consequentemente, iremos votar contra, visto que não foi alcançado o objectivo de facultar aos consumidores uma informação correcta e pormenorizada acerca da origem e da composição dos produtos.
Consequentemente, já não há qualquer motivo para não poderem integrar esta zona de livre circulação. Eu consideraria inaceitável que certos Estados, utilizando pretextos falsos e motivados por cálculos de política interna, se continuassem a opor a essa integração. O acervo da União não deve ser encarado como um sistema à la carte em que os Estados-Membros podem adaptar ou suspender disposições em função das circunstâncias.
Consequentemente, o impacto negativo e positivo no clima e no ambiente e a utilização de fundos da UE devem ser analisados a todos os níveis.
Consequentemente, penso que temos de assegurar, neste momento, que exista na Europa uma maior distribuição das obras criativas e que seja proporcionado o livre acesso em linha a essas obras, sem ignorar, contudo, o facto de os artistas e as suas obras terem de ser protegidos e receber uma remuneração justa.
Consequentemente, precisamos de resistir a estas novas religião secular e forma de loucura, que vêm repor em questão o acerto da decisão de aderirem à União Europeia de países como a Polónia, uma vez que os forçariam a despender na redução das emissões de CO2 um montante muito superior ao dos ganhos líquidos que retiraram da política de coesão até à data.
Consequentemente, sou favorável à criação de recursos próprios e a um imposto sobre as transacções financeiras. O aumento necessário no orçamento europeu tem de ser acompanhado por economias significativas realizadas através da optimização da nossa despesa.
Consequentemente, todos os Estados-Membros podem vetar o orçamento para 2012.
Consequentemente, todos os actores do mercado de trabalho, nomeadamente os dos sectores profissionais, das empresas, dos sindicatos, dos ministérios e dos serviços públicos de emprego, devem empenhar-se num diálogo estruturado sobre as formas de promover a integração dos jovens, de promover formação formal e informal e, em última análise, de desenvolver um sistema de ensino na UE que seja capaz de proporcionar segurança profissional aos nossos jovens.
Consequentemente, é através desta resolução que queremos dizer que não aceitamos, de facto, o que ele fez. Não apoiamos o terrorismo, mas queremos defender o princípio de que todas as pessoas têm o direito a um julgamento imparcial, e estamos a pugnar pela abolição da pena de morte.
Considera que as reduções de dotações propostas no orçamento do próximo exercício terão um impacto negativo nas verbas afectadas à educação, à formação profissional e à promoção do emprego na UE em geral?
Considerais aceitável que a União tenha Estados-Membros onde não existe um tribunal constitucional, ou onde existe um tribunal constitucional, mas dotado de fracos poderes? A nova constituição do meu país orgulha-se de garantir uma protecção constitucional forte.
Considerais compatível com a proibição da discriminação baseada no nascimento que a União Europeia tenha Estados-Membros, como a Espanha, a Bélgica ou a Suécia, em que os cidadãos têm direito a ocupar altos cargos públicos, nomeadamente o de monarca, com base no seu nascimento? A nova constituição do meu país não aplica esta discriminação. Considerais aceitável que a União tenha Estados-Membros, nomeadamente o Reino Unido, que não possuem uma constituição escrita unificada? A nova constituição do meu país é uma constituição escrita democrática.
Consideramos ainda que os testes devem ser realizados noutras instalações, como em reactores utilizados para fins de investigação, assim como relativamente a outras ameaças, como as consequências de um ataque terrorista ou as fragilidades estruturais de uma central.
Consideramos estas estruturas como sendo, efectivamente, o produto directo de entidades democraticamente eleitas (a nível das cidades, dos departamentos, municípios, etc.). Representam o interesse geral e devem, portanto, ser distinguidas daqueles que são, eles sim, representantes de interesses individuais.
Consideramos igualmente digno de apoio o projecto de decisão publicado, e valorizamos os elementos que destacam que o objectivo é criar condições de trabalho dignas e emprego regulamentado num domínio onde, de facto, estão envolvidos sobretudo trabalhadores migrantes, em particular em determinados países, de modo totalmente desregulamentado e descontrolado, muitas vezes sob a forma de um tipo de escravatura moderna.
Consideramos importante que se avance para a aprovação de uma Convenção da OIT complementada por uma recomendação sobre os trabalhadores domésticos, que são, na sua maioria, mulheres e, cada vez mais, imigrantes sem papéis, sendo dos grupos mais vulneráveis e sujeitos à violência ou ao abuso sexual, pelo que seria muito positivo que, na próxima Conferência Internacional do Trabalho, fosse dado um passo decisivo nesse sentido.
Consideramos importante um aspecto referido pelo senhor deputado Hannes Swoboda, a saber: a questão da igualdade de direitos de participação do público a nível transfronteiriço. É frequente que os locais de armazenamento final e as centrais nucleares fiquem situados em áreas próximas de fronteiras nacionais, por razões geológicas ou outras, o que significa que a participação indivisível e igual dos cidadãos, a transparência e a salvaguarda dos direitos são, todos eles, elementos necessários de uma perspectiva europeia.
Consideramos inaceitável a sujeição, uma vez mais, do orçamento da União Europeia (desta vez, para 2012) aos objectivos da denominada Estratégia UE 2020, herdeira da falhada Estratégia de Lisboa cujos anunciados objectivos de redução da pobreza e de criação de emprego não passaram de propaganda. A situação concreta de países como Portugal demonstra-o, com mais pessoas em situação de pobreza, mais desemprego e aumento das desigualdades.
Consideramos mesmo que se deve continuar a trabalhar no sentido de ajudar a estabilizar a situação de tantos milhões de pessoas afectadas.
Consideramos necessário corrigir os desequilíbrios macroeconómicos e avançar para a convergência, e entendemos que o relatório Ferreira segue essa via específica.
Consideramos positivo o conteúdo da resolução, orientado pela necessidade de uma utilização prudente e responsável destes agentes.
Consideramos que a candidatura preenche os critérios de elegibilidade definidos no Regulamento FEG, e recomendamos a sua aprovação através da apresentação do nosso parecer positivo.
Consideramos que as estruturas de cooperação necessárias já estão criadas; o que necessitamos é de vontade política para fazer progressos concretos.
Consideramos que existem duas possibilidades: um imposto sobre as transacções financeiras e um imposto sobre as actividades financeiras.
Consideramos que isto significa, por exemplo, proibir o dumping salarial e fiscal ou instituir normas mínimas para impedir que a concorrência seja distorcida no mercado de trabalho.
Consideramos que o ensino e a formação profissionais devem ser acessíveis, devem estar disponíveis e devem ter um preço abordável em todas as fases da vida das pessoas, independentemente do seu estatuto no mercado de trabalho e dos seus rendimentos. O ensino e a formação profissionais devem criar condições propícias à mobilidade da mão-de-obra, tanto a nível da formação inicial, como no âmbito do processo de formação ao longo da vida.
Consideramos que o instrumento da resolução de emergência pode ser desadequado, ou mesmo contraproducente, para a consecução do objectivo pretendido, nomeadamente a evolução constante do Azerbaijão no sentido de uma democracia plena e moderna.
Consideramos que o sistema mundial de navegação por satélite (GNSS) da UE, composto pelos programas Galileu e EGNOS, constitui um passo importante para a Europa, em primeiro lugar, porque assegura a sua autonomia e independência em relação a outros sistemas globais de navegação e, em segundo lugar, porque lhe permite conquistar uma quota deste mercado mundial de alta tecnologia em grande expansão. Contudo, é muito importante que a continuidade do serviço seja garantida, uma vez que uma limitação (temporária) ou uma degradação dos sinais do GPS terá um enorme impacto na nossa economia e na nossa sociedade, a não existirem outros sistemas GNSS independentes instalados.
Consideramos que se trata de uma conquista fundamental do ponto de vista da competitividade da UE e, em particular, da competitividade das pequenas e médias empresas. O senhor deputado Creutzmann queria ser informado acerca da questão da sociedade privada europeia e solicitou que a mesma fosse tratada com carácter prioritário.
Consideramos que tal proposta é impraticável no momento, e em seu lugar propomos, por regra, uma harmonização mínima aliada a um elevado nível de protecção dos consumidores, salientando a necessidade de convergência das regulamentações nacionais relativamente ao exercício e efeitos do direito de resolução. Tudo isso ajudará a reforçar a confiança dos consumidores e a superar a relutância das empresas em se envolverem no comércio transfronteiriço. Pessoas e organizações com interesse em matéria de protecção dos consumidores terão de apresentar relatórios à Comissão sobre os resultados da aplicação da presente directiva.
Consideramos que um organismo de notação de crédito de iniciativa política poderia ser uma forma de pressionar as grandes agências privadas.
Consideramos que é importante verificar a fiabilidade e a comparabilidade dos dados para se poder proceder a algumas melhorias e garantir um elevado nível de qualidade da contabilidade ambiental. Há que ter igualmente em linha de conta o desenvolvimento de novos módulos e a experiência adquirida no decorrer de estudos-piloto. O relatório de revisão deve ser encarado como uma oportunidade de ajustar o regulamento à luz dos últimos progressos conseguidos e das experiências amadurecidas.
Consideramos que é necessário apoiar a investigação pública e disponibilizar os seus resultados de forma simples e desburocratizada, estimulando a actividade produtiva e empresarial (em especial, das PME), a criação de emprego qualificado, com direitos, o progresso social e o desenvolvimento sustentável, apostando em campos tão diversos como a eficiência energética, novas fontes de energia, a eficiência de uso dos recursos, a reciclagem, novos processos de produção, entre outros.
Consideramos que é necessário examinar a possibilidade de alertar os consumidores para essas potenciais reacções alérgicas.
Consideramos realmente que o facto de esta Constituição referir os direitos do nascituro constitui um risco para a modernidade? Consideramos realmente que o facto de as origens cristãs de um país serem referidas nesta Constituição constitui um risco para a identidade?
Consideramos também que é muito importante melhorar a eficácia das despesas administrativas da UE, e uma das formas de o conseguir consiste em aumentar a transparência do processo de distribuição e de utilização destas despesas.
Consideramos um resultado positivo o facto de o Conselho ter reconhecido que o processo de quitação e o processo orçamental são dois processos diferentes que devem ser tratados em separado. É também de saudar o facto de os membros do Conselho assistirem e participarem no actual debate sobre a proposta de quitação. Infelizmente, os representantes do Conselho ignoraram o convite da comissão técnica também este ano. Não participaram no debate da comissão sobre o processo de quitação, nem facilitaram o acesso a documentos importantes que teriam sido necessários para conceder a quitação, e o Conselho Europeu também não respondeu às perguntas da comissão parlamentar. São estes os problemas que precisam, uma vez por todas, de ser ultrapassados.
Consideramos, todavia, que, em cada um destes pontos, se poderia e deveria ter ido mais longe, sobretudo na defesa da coerência entre os proclamados objectivos no domínio da política de cooperação para o desenvolvimento e as diversas políticas sectoriais da UE.
Considerando o aumento das crises políticas e humanitárias em todo o mundo, a UE tem de fazer o melhor uso possível dos seus instrumentos de política externa para garantir uma melhor utilização da sua influência em organizações multilaterais e da sua capacidade de assumir a liderança perante as crises internacionais, actualmente e no futuro. A promoção da democracia e dos direitos humanos, nomeadamente dos direitos das mulheres e das crianças, da liberdade de expressão e do Estado de direito deve estar no centro da acção externa da UE.
Considerando que a Croácia é uma das principais rotas de tráfico de droga para a UE e onde têm sido feitas apreensões significativas de produtos alucinogéneos ilícitos (canábis, heroína, cocaína, ecstasy e anfetaminas); considerando a adopção de um Programa Nacional de Prevenção do Consumo da Droga entre os Jovens por parte do Governo croata; considerando que a República da Croácia solicitou a adesão à UE, cuja integração se prevê em 2013, apoio a assinatura do Acordo entre a União Europeia e a República da Croácia para que esta possa integrar o Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência, sediado na cidade de Lisboa.
Considerando que a Internet é o principal instrumento para criar melhores condições de desenvolvimento e conhecimento para os cidadãos em termos culturais, nomeadamente através da difusão de conteúdos audiovisuais, congratulo-me com a aprovação deste relatório e formulo votos para que a UE desempenhe um papel de liderança no espectro radioeléctrico e na criação de software de desenvolvimento e inovação (D&I).
Considerando que a União Europeia é o segundo maior parceiro comercial do Canadá e que o Canadá é um importante parceiro da UE em matéria de investimento directo estrangeiro, votei a favor da proposta de resolução sobre as relações comerciais entre a UE e o Canadá. Simultaneamente, gostaria de salientar que a Polónia é o maior parceiro comercial do Canadá entre os países da Europa Central e Oriental e, há mais de uma dezena de anos, mantém um superavit comercial bilateral que tem crescido de ano para ano. A votação de hoje é um passo fundamental, que constitui um bom auspício para o futuro.
Considerando que a principal actividade económica das Seicheles é a pesca e o turismo que se trata de um acordo vantajoso quer para a UE quer para a República das Seicheles devido à criação de emprego (3 000 nas Seicheles e 760 na Europa) e ao controlo das capturas pela existência de um programa sectorial plurianual que prevê a cooperação científica e a promoção de uma pesca responsável e sustentável, voto favoravelmente esta proposta de recomendação.
Considerando que as propostas apresentadas, após dez anos de estudos, vão de encontro à resolução das falhas detectadas, as quais se prendem essencialmente com os contratos, e que é necessário promover o mercado interno eliminando barreiras, manifesto a minha concordância com o presente relatório, que introduz um instrumento facultativo (IF) que poderá ser complementado com uma caixa de ferramentas, com que se pretende resolver o problema dos contratos.
Considerando que o Grupo Consultivo dos Serviços Jurídicos do Parlamento Europeu, do Conselho e da Comissão concluiu, no seu parecer, que a proposta em apreço se cinge à codificação pura e simples dos textos existentes, sem alterações substantivas, aprovo a sua posição em primeira leitura, fazendo sua a proposta da Comissão, na redacção resultante da adaptação às recomendações do Grupo Consultivo dos Serviços Jurídicos do Parlamento Europeu, do Conselho e da Comissão.
Considerando que os acontecimentos recentes avivaram a urgência de trazer esta questão a debate, a Comissão aproveita esta oportunidade, através da sua Comunicação, para abordar inconsistências há muito subjacentes e problemas não resolvidos que deram margem a alguns Estados-Membros para agirem unilateralmente e não necessariamente na perspectiva da União Europeia.
Considerando que se trata de mais um passo positivo nas já amplas relações entre a UE e o Principado de Andorra em ordem a uma possível integração no mercado interno e que, além da inclusão de regras de salvaguarda da congruência entre o Acordo e o acervo comunitário, visa garantir a segurança aduaneira e a normalidade nas relações comerciais entre as duas partes, saúdo a aprovação desta recomendação que votei favoravelmente.
Consideremos a Líbia, por exemplo: em virtude da ausência de consenso político e de meios militares adequados, houve que formar uma "coligação de vontades" - um conceito a que nos opusemos com tanta inflexibilidade quando outros o usaram antes - e a NATO teve de ser chamada a assumir o comando! A Líbia ignorou praticamente toda a nossa PCSD, precisamente num momento em que era necessária, tendo assim a oportunidade de se aplicar na prática! Consequentemente, na minha opinião, temos de rever a nossa PCSD, para nos apercebermos o que realmente falta para se tornar um conceito funcional, tanto do ponto de vista politico como militar, de modo a que na próxima vez que precisarmos de a aplicar, não tenhamos uma decepção como agora.
Consideremos apenas os temas de alguns desses relatórios: menções ou marcas que permitem identificar o lote ao qual pertence um género alimentício; aproximação das legislações dos Estados-Membros respeitantes às unidades de medida; nível sonoro admissível e dispositivo de escape dos veículos a motor; tractores agrícolas e florestais com rodas de via estreita; comandos dos tractores agrícolas e florestais de rodas; travagem dos tractores agrícolas ou florestais de rodas; acesso ao lugar de condução assim como às portas e janelas dos tractores agrícolas e florestais de rodas; dispositivos de protecção montados na retaguarda em caso de capotagem de tractores agrícolas e florestais com rodas de via estreita; impostos especiais sobre o consumo de tabacos manufacturados; valores faciais e especificações técnicas das moedas em euros destinadas a circulação; denominações das fibras têxteis e correspondente etiquetagem de produtos têxteis... e poderia continuar.
Considero a Agenda Urbana Europeia uma política de indubitável importância, dado que 70 % da população europeia vive nas cidades e que as mesmas geram cerca de 80 % do PIB da UE. O período de 2007-2013 conta com 21,1 mil milhões de euros para o desenvolvimento urbano a ser aplicado na reabilitação de espaços industriais e de solos poluídos, na regeneração urbana e rural, nos transportes urbanos não poluentes e nas habitações. A agenda urbana europeia versa sobre o desenvolvimento das infra-estruturas e serviços das cidades.
Considero ainda essencial que o actual sistema de quotas para o leite se mantenha.
Considero ainda que as instituições europeias devem acelerar a mobilização do FEG a favor da Bélgica, garantindo o Estado-Membro a integração na vida activa dos trabalhadores despedidos em consequência da globalização. Gostaria ainda de salientar que o FEG não deverá substituir as responsabilidades legais e financeiras da General Motors, sendo este um apoio complementar concedido pela União Europeia para diminuir as dificuldades sociais que os trabalhadores irão enfrentar.
Considero ainda ser importante que o Sétimo Programa-Quadro contribua para a definição do Espaço Europeu de Investigação, de acordo com o consagrado no ponto 1 do artigo 179.° do título XIX do Tratado da União Europeia.
Considero bastante satisfatório este relatório sobre o mandato para o trílogo. O facto de, num momento de crise e de cortes necessários, ainda haver um aumento nos recursos do orçamento europeu para a subcategoria 3a, relativa à gestão da imigração, é, a meu ver, uma coisa positiva.
Considero capital a adopção de uma posição harmoniosa relativamente às relações externas por parte dos Estados-Membros, pois tal coesão conduzirá à paz, à segurança, à solidariedade e à prevenção de conflitos a nível internacional, bem como ao desenvolvimento sustentável e à capacidade da UE para influenciar a ordem internacional.
Considero capital a adopção de uma posição harmoniosa relativamente às relações externas por parte dos Estados-Membros, pois tal coesão contribuirá para a paz, segurança, solidariedade e prevenção de conflitos a nível internacional, bem como para o desenvolvimento sustentável e a capacidade da UE para influenciar a ordem internacional.
Considero correcto que o Conselho esteja presente. Não entendo que haja motivo para o referir.
Considero de extrema importância a conclusão, hoje, dos trabalhos relativos à recomendação para segunda leitura sobre a directiva relativa à aplicação de imposições aos veículos pesados de mercadorias pela utilização de certas infra-estruturas - a directiva Eurovinheta. A questão essencial e mais importante prende-se com a disposição que estabelece o princípio do "poluidor-pagador", segundo a qual os veículos pesados que causam mais poluição e que são mais ruidosos do que os equipados com motores que satisfaçam as normas de emissão Euro V ou VI serão sujeitos a portagens para a utilização de infra-estruturas rodoviária.
Considero determinante que a PAC fomente o desenvolvimento de alimentos seguros e saudáveis destinados não só à população em geral, mas também à indústria alimentar em particular.
Considero essencial que adoptemos gradualmente um sistema semelhante aos usado nos EUA, que têm 65 anos de experiência e assenta na publicação de documentos essenciais por parte dos grupos de representação de interesses (por exemplo, de todos os contratos superiores a 10 000 dólares americanos).
Considero este intervalo inaceitável porque oferece perspectivas de pagamentos a poucas zonas necessitadas de apoio, incluindo na parte ocidental da UE. Isto vai contra o próprio objectivo do apoio regional, nomeadamente o reforço das regiões mais fracas.
Considero fundamental que as verbas da política de coesão sejam, pelo menos, mantidas nos mesmos montantes.
Considero igualmente necessário que os EstadosMembros da UE partilhem o uso de instalações de tratamento e armazenamento de resíduos provenientes de centrais de energia nuclear.
Considero igualmente que este relatório é uma manobra de diversão, destinada a afastar a atenção do facto de a protecção dos consumidores ao nível da UE, algo muito mais importante, ainda necessitar de ser melhorada.
Considero importante criar uma categoria intermédia para as regiões cujo PIB per capita se situe entre 75 e 90 % do PIB da UE, contribuindo assim para uma maior equidade a nível regional.
Considero importante o debate que aqui realizámos e a iniciativa da nossa presidente da Comissão do Emprego e dos Assuntos Sociais sobre a necessária valorização dos trabalhadores domésticos, que são na sua maioria mulheres trabalhadoras, que prestam serviços de assistência doméstica, de limpeza, de restauração, e que são vulgarmente vítimas de grande exploração, de grande discriminação, que se acentua ainda quando também são imigrantes. E, por isso, é da maior importância encarar de frente este problema.
Considero importante que o Parlamento Europeu continue a desempenhar um papel no acompanhamento da implementação da directiva por parte dos Estados-Membros ao longo dos próximos dois anos. A adopção da directiva é um resultado importante, mas a sua transposição para o direito nacional é uma fase fundamental para garantir que a legislação seja devidamente implementada pelos Estados-Membros e para que não se criem quaisquer obstáculos ou barreiras em relação ao mercado único.
Considero inacreditável que o Conselho, que sempre exigiu que os outros actuem de maneira transparente, tenha sido manifestamente muito mais reservado no que lhe diz respeito. O nosso pedido é muito simples, Senhor Presidente em exercício: enquanto Parlamento, o órgão que aprova a quitação, queremos ter acesso a todos os documentos.
Considero incorrecto que se inste o Conselho a definir prioridades negativas ou, por outras palavras, reduções.
Considero lamentável que nem os deputados da esquerda, que se sentam aqui à minha direita, tenham sido capazes de se reunir oportunamente para fazer uma declaração sobre a Grécia em nome do Parlamento.
Considero muito importante a prestação de ajuda externa e, por isso, regozijo-me com a decisão do Conselho, de 23 de Maio de 2011, de atribuir 200 milhões de euros à cooperação para o desenvolvimento com o Sudão do Sul, a fim de contribuir para a autonomia das comunidades locais e de fazer face às necessidades básicas da população e à inexistência de recursos humanos e de infra-estruturas.
Considero muito importante que a proposta apresentada pela Comissão sobre a introdução de declarações de gestão seja, finalmente, aprovada, porque o que está efectivamente em causa neste contexto é o aumento da responsabilização dos Estados-Membros, que têm a seu cargo a gestão de 80% do orçamento.
Considero necessário um melhor leque de estatísticas sobre as consequências ambientais das políticas dos Estados-Membros e da UE, bem como sobre a contabilização de certos impostos que sustentam as políticas ambientais. É lamentável que as estatísticas e os impostos sejam indiscriminadamente incluídos numa contabilidade ambiental. O objectivo dessa assimilação é a implementação do mercado do clima e dos seus direitos bolsistas de poluição. A delegação de poderes para a Comissão também vai nessa direcção. Votei favoravelmente, uma vez que defendo a ideia de instrumentos estatísticos necessários, mesmo recusando as políticas que eles servem.
Considero normal que as respeitemos e que cumpramos as promessas que fizemos quando aderimos.
Considero o acordo prematuro. A segunda questão é a da proibição de produtos derivados da foca na UE e é extremamente importante. O acordo em apreço pode reforçar a relação bilateral já de si forte em matéria de comércio e investimento entre a UE e o Canadá; porém, deve ser uma relação benéfica para ambas as partes e, portanto, por agora, abstive-me.
Considero o seu relatório muitíssimo bom, sobretudo porque é o trabalho de uma comissão inteira que partilhava o objectivo comum de beneficiar os jovens.
Considero positivo pretender colocar o QFP ao serviço dos objectivos da Estratégia UE 2020 e a preocupação em pelo menos manter o orçamento para a PAC e a manutenção do sistema de dois pilares.
Considero positivo que, no nosso relatório, seja criado um sistema para abordar os países que não cumprem os seus compromissos, por outras palavras, a obrigação de que os problemas sejam solucionados directamente.
Considero que a Comissão deve ter um papel mais forte e independente no processo de supervisão reforçada no que diz respeito às avaliações específicas a cada Estado-Membro, ao acompanhamento, às missões, e às recomendações. Defendo o método comunitário e, por isso, concordo que se deva limitar o papel do Conselho nas etapas que levam à aplicação de eventuais sanções. No entanto, o mais importante é que se avance para uma governação económica com uma forte vertente preventiva e correctiva de forma a que se evitem as referidas sanções.
Considero que a União Europeia deve tomar este facto como ponto de partida e assumir um papel verdadeiramente activo nas relações com as potências mundiais existentes e emergentes, dissipando de vez a sua reputação de interveniente político menor no panorama internacional.
Considero que a União Europeia e o Japão devem contribuir para a conclusão bem-sucedida das negociações da Agenda de Desenvolvimento de Doha. O ACL UE-Japão não só traria benefícios em termos de aumento do comércio bilateral em bens e serviços, como também promoveria a cooperação a nível das prioridades horizontais da UE, nomeadamente a cooperação no domínio da inovação, a cooperação em matéria regulamentar e a luta contra os abusos do mercado, a cooperação em matéria de luta contra os grandes desafios ambientais, etc.
Considero que a agricultura e uma política agrícola comum forte e dotada de recursos adequados são fulcrais para a realização deste objectivo.
Considero que a ajuda aos países emergentes, embora promovendo o crescimento económico sustentável, deve continuar a centrar-se no reforço da política orçamental dos países parceiros e no fomento da mobilização das receitas internas, o que deverá contribuir para a redução da pobreza e da dependência em relação à ajuda.
Considero que a análise da avaliação intercalar do Sétimo Programa Quadro (PQ7) em matéria de investigação e desenvolvimento tecnológico representa uma oportunidade para a valiosa ligação entre conhecimento, educação e investigação. Ao longo dos anos, o PQ7 tornou-se um dos mais vastos programas de apoio à investigação a nível mundial e constitui a principal ferramenta da política de investigação da UE. Além disso, oferece à UE a oportunidade de adequar a sua política de investigação às suas ambições económicas e sociais através da consolidação do Espaço Europeu de Investigação.
Considero que a aposta na investigação é essencial, contribuindo para o desenvolvimento dos antimicrobianos como ferramenta eficaz no combate às doenças, tanto nas pessoas como nos animais, devendo, no entanto, limitar-se o uso dos mesmos ao estritamente necessário.
Considero que a apresentação desta proposta de nova directiva, fruto do compromisso entre a Presidência húngara, a Comissão e o Parlamento, é fortemente prejudicial para a economia italiana, pois a Itália transporta cerca de um terço - o correspondente a cerca de 200 mil milhões de euros por ano - de todos os bens negociados transportados nas estradas europeias.
Considero que a intervenção do Parlamento Europeu (PE), numa fase gestionária do redesenho deste instrumento, será uma mais valia efectiva para o mesmo, pelo que saúdo esta iniciativa.
Considero que a reconciliação entre o Hamas e a Fatah e o facto de ambos os movimentos estarem dispostos a fundar um Estado representam uma oportunidade muito importante, porque a fundação de um Estado implica empenhamento e responsabilidade.
Considero que a senhora deputada Berès merece os nossos agradecimentos por ter iniciado este processo, permitindo que nos aliemos à iniciativa da OIT e originando uma reflexão sobre as medidas necessárias em prol de uma categoria de trabalhadores com condições que frequentemente desconhecemos e que, quando conhecemos, tendem a ser deprimentes.
Considero que alcançar e sustentar a qualidade de vida envolve factores importantes, consensuais, tais como saúde, educação, cultura, emprego, habitação e condições ambientais.
Considero que as PME são essenciais para a retoma económica de muitos Estados-Membros. O caminho para a recuperação da Irlanda está a ser motivado pelas exportações; assim, a eliminação dos obstáculos à entrada no mercado da UE é determinante.
Considero que as actividades das agências de notação de crédito são na generalidade extremamente dúbias. Não apenas por não identificarem os riscos tempestivamente, como no caso do mercado imobiliário dos Estados Unidos, mas também porque podem piorar uma situação já de si má após a ocorrência de uma crise. Não podemos permitir que agências de notação privadas dos EUA decidam arbitrariamente a solvabilidade dos Estados europeus. O relatório em apreço é um passo no sentido certo com vista à existência de controlos mais rigorosos das agências de notação de crédito, razão pela qual votei a favor.
Considero que as alterações propostas, apresentadas pelo Grupo S&D e aprovadas em sede de comissão, contribuem para uma definição mais inclusiva, abrangendo a liberdade religiosa, de fé e da expansão da lista de minorias que necessitam de protecção internacional.
Considero que as duas propostas são necessárias e irão ajudar a estabelecer o Sudão do Sul como Estado independente e ajudar em qualquer emergência que possa surgir.
Considero que as notações de risco devem servir para aumentar a informação disponível no mercado, de forma a proporcionar aos investidores uma avaliação consistente do risco de crédito em todos os sectores e países, e penso que é importante permitir aos utilizadores um melhor controlo das ANC.
Considero que as propostas contidas neste pacote não são suficientemente ambiciosas, na medida em que estão dirigidas unicamente para a austeridade e para a redução dos direitos sociais dos cidadãos. Não é feita qualquer referência a elementos susceptíveis de alicerçar uma verdadeira recuperação económica da Europa, como seja a realização de investimentos em domínios cruciais como as infra-estruturas, a educação, e investigação e a inovação.
Considero que as receitas geradas pela taxa de utilização da infra-estrutura e pela taxa de externalidade devem ser utilizadas para apoiar a rede transeuropeia de transportes, melhorar a segurança rodoviária e disponibilizar zonas de estacionamento seguras, que são uma necessidade absoluta para o cumprimento da legislação social aplicável.
Considero que chegou o momento de a União Europeia e o Parlamento Europeu recusarem terminantemente esta política nacionalista, enquanto não é demasiado tarde.
Considero que devemos apoiar uma maior cooperação entre os diferentes programas europeus de investigação, desenvolvimento tecnológico e inovação, e entendo que a continuidade do futuro programa, uma vez estabelecido, é importante para todos os agentes envolvidos.
Considero que devemos manter a nossa cooperação estreita com a OIT, uma vez que o seu trabalho neste domínio, bem como em outros, se aplica em grande medida ao contexto europeu.
Considero que deveremos, um dia, realizar um debate muito sério sobre essa questão e procurar uma solução comum neste domínio, pois está em causa uma questão de democracia.
Considero que deveriam ser dados mais poderes de controlo à instituição a que pertenço, ou seja o Parlamento, de modo a poder conhecer plenamente os tipos de acordo que merecem ou não a sua aprovação. O nosso voto seria o resultado de uma vigilância atenta do resultado das negociações, que deve promover a conformidade com a legislação internacional em matéria de direitos sociais, o pleno reconhecimento das práticas e dos procedimentos de certificação, o intercâmbio de dados em matéria de segurança e inspecções conjuntas.
Considero que em tempo de crise devemos concentrar-nos realmente, tanto do ponto de vista político como financeiro, em tornar possível e em apoiar a mobilidade dos jovens.
Considero que esta combinação de factos, esta falta de igualdade e os fossos que estão a surgir e são bem patentes no seio da União Europeia são o problema e uma das causas do problema.
Considero que esta nova directiva trará um aumento das transacções intra-europeias, permitindo, por um lado, a salvaguarda dos consumidores e o pleno funcionamento do mercado único, tal como estabelecido no Tratado da Comunidade Europeia artigo 26º ponto 2. "O mercado interno compreende um espaço sem fronteiras internas no qual a livre circulação das mercadorias, das pessoas, dos serviços e dos capitais é assegurada".
Considero que esta questão está inexoravelmente ligada ao desemprego dos jovens, cuja taxa é actualmente muito elevada na União. Devemos oferecer respostas para o futuro destes jovens, que são o futuro da União Europeia.
Considero que estas são as questões críticas no panorama mundial actual, e a UE deve desempenhar um papel essencial em todos estes domínios.
Considero que este compromisso não constitui uma resposta adequada, sobretudo para um país como a Itália, por exemplo, que é um ponto de partida de fluxos de transporte que trazem riqueza para o nosso sistema nacional e que é preciso salvaguardar mediante a identificação de instrumentos adequados para combater a poluição atmosférica e acústica, mas tendo na devida conta as suas especificidades estruturais e logísticas.
Considero que este resultado pouco harmonioso na estrutura final do pacote se deve a um desacordo quanto às origens e à natureza da crise.
Considero que existe apenas uma forma de ultrapassar a crise, que não existem atalhos. A resposta reside nas políticas nacionais, no cumprimento de compromissos estabelecidos e acordados. A solidariedade entre EstadosMembros da UE tem de ser acompanhada de um sentido de responsabilidade e tem de respeitar normas que os EstadosMembros não podem, nem devem, violar deliberadamente.
Considero que fazer opções em conjunto relativamente a um documento tão importante como o orçamento é mais um excelente sinal da nossa capacidade de trabalhar no seio da União, o que, neste momento, é particularmente significativo.
Considero que nós, europeus, reunidos hoje neste Parlamento, não temos outra opção senão afirmar bem alto: "sim” a uma Bielorrússia livre, "sim” à democracia na Bielorrússia e "sim” à nação bielorrussa na Europa.
Considero que o PIB é um indicador limitado e que devem ser desenvolvidos indicadores para complementá-lo. O relatório aborda as questões supracitadas, que considero serem muito importantes e carecerem de resolução imediata, motivo pelo qual votei a favor deste relatório específico.
Considero que o acordo sobre este pacote reforçará os nossos mecanismos de vigilância económica à escala europeia. O referido acordo deixará a União Europeia muito melhor colocada para impedir o agravamento da dívida pública e de défices insustentáveis, bem como a emergência de desequilíbrios macroeconómicos.
Considero que o apoio às actividades relacionadas com o mar e a criação de uma nova categoria para as regiões situadas entre 75 % e 90 % do rendimento per capita da UE são muito positivos para a Galiza.
Considero que o debate que agora realizaremos constituirá uma boa oportunidade para esta Assembleia manifestar a sua opinião a respeito destas negociações. Essa opinião será tida em conta na medida do possível, tendo em conta as realidades e especificidades destas negociações em particular. A este respeito, aguardamos com expectativa a resolução que prevêem adoptar sobre o ACL com a Índia, que, acredito, é muito oportuna.
Considero que o excelente relatório do deputado Mitchell sublinha os domínios onde a Europa pode e deve fazer melhor. A experiência do instrumento financeiro de cooperação para o desenvolvimento (ICD) tem sido crucial para se perceber de que forma a União Europeia deve progredir no âmbito do próximo quadro financeiro plurianual.
Considero que o nosso debate dedicado à educação e à cultura é importante, e gostaria de acrescentar uma abordagem que até ao momento tem estado em falta em numerosas considerações importantes. A compreensão e o respeito mútuos são condições fundamentais para as comunidades nacionais tradicionais, as minorias e as maiorias viverem em conjunto de forma harmoniosa e próspera. A educação desempenha aqui um papel vital.
Considero que o orçamento da UE deve ser dotado de recursos suficientes para poder financiar os compromissos que foram assumidos.
Considero que o papel dos governos locais, das parcerias empresariais e das instituições de ensino é da maior importância para o desenvolvimento dos requisitos do mercado de trabalho relativamente ao ensino e à formação profissionais. A oportunidade de mobilidade constitui uma componente importante do ensino e da formação profissionais, mas deveria ser dada maior ênfase a uma melhor harmonização dos diferentes sistemas educativos dos Estados-Membros - incluindo à questão do reconhecimento mútuo de certificados e diplomas - numa perspectiva de melhorar a colaboração e apoiar a mobilidade. O ensino e a formação profissionais de alta qualidade contribuem de modo fundamental para o desenvolvimento sustentável. Há que criar melhores oportunidades de formação para os formadores, particularmente à escala local e regional, numa perspectiva de assegurar a eficácia dos sistemas de ensino e formação profissionais, bem como uma eficaz e bem sucedida transferência de conhecimentos. A possibilidade de aprender num contexto internacional constitui um pré-requisito para uma vida laboral bem sucedida, para promover a aquisição de competências no domínio das línguas estrangeiras e para aumentar a competitividade.
Considero que o princípio poluidor-pagador não é uma solução que se limita a entregar ao mercado a decisão. Autorizar e legitimar a poluição caso seja economicamente viável para a empresa não é um caminho para a sustentabilidade.
Considero que o relatório sublinha os aspectos críticos do Sétimo Programa-Quadro.
Considero que o texto acordado constitui um compromisso equilibrado, que incorpora muitas das alterações apresentadas pelo Parlamento e deixa margem para mais desenvolvimentos no futuro próximo, o que é muito importante, como foi salientado pela Senhora Presidente Győri na sua intervenção. A curto prazo, ou logo que entre em vigor o novo regulamento, os consumidores disporão de mais informação sobre a presença de partes não têxteis de origem animal nos tecidos e terão também acesso a informações sobre a composição completa dos produtos têxteis.
Considero que os Estados-Membros devem adoptar quanto antes a última proposta pendente, relativa ao estatuto da sociedade privada europeia, que permitirá às PME operar em toda a UE ao mesmo tempo que se reduzem os custos e se fomenta o crescimento nesta área.
Considero que os capítulos da agricultura constituirão uma questão importante para ambas as partes nestas negociações. Estou preocupado com eventuais concessões importantes no domínio dos OGM, do leite e da rotulagem de origem.
Considero que podemos orgulhar-nos destas questões. Vivemos num continente em que determinados valores constituem ainda uma preocupação central e não são demasiado afectados pela globalização. Em minha opinião, não se pode ser a economia mais sustentável do mundo baseada no conhecimento sem respeitar os valores que caracterizam a sociedade europeia.
Considero que se deve prestar muita atenção aos sectores mais sensíveis da Europa, como a indústria, a agricultura e os serviços. A Índia é uma das maiores economias do mundo, com um sector de serviços em rápido crescimento.
Considero que se impõe desenvolver um instrumento que possa complementar o PIB, tendo em conta a necessidade de ter uma aplicação prática, utilizar indicadores claramente definidos e ter como base dados de qualidade.
Considero que temos de apoiar os Estados-Membros e as regiões incentivando a sinergia entre as políticas estruturais, sociais e rurais. A definição de um quadro estratégico comum para o próximo período de programação financeira permitiria uma abordagem reforçada e iria potencializar as sinergias entre as medidas executadas nas regiões europeias, com vista a apoiar os objectivos das políticas da UE.
Considero que temos vindo a conseguir, sem dúvida alguma, uma maior coerência no nosso trabalho. Há muito mais a fazer - não duvido - e há muito mais que os Senhores gostariam que fizéssemos, mas não subestimemos o que já se conseguiu alcançar e o caminho que temos feito para lá chegar.
Considero que traria valor acrescentado ao programa Capital Europeia da Cultura e ao conjunto da União Europeia.
Considero que é fundamental adoptar a patente única europeia a fim de incentivar a realização de trocas comerciais fora da União. Actualmente, as patentes são demasiado dispendiosas; temos obrigatoriamente de reduzir os custos associados à sua criação.
Considero que é necessário canalizar mais financiamentos para estas comunidades ao abrigo do Fundo Europeu das Pescas pós-2013. O processo de paz na Irlanda beneficiou enormemente do orçamento da UE. Exorto todos os membros do PE a apoiarem a continuação destes importantes programas.
Considero que é necessário desenvolver uma coordenação eficaz da investigação entre a UE e as autoridades nacionais e regionais.
Considero que é necessário introduzir novos indicadores de medição do PIB, como a sustentabilidade ambiental e a inclusão social, para que o conjunto dos dados que compõe o PIB forneça uma imagem mais fiel do país ou da região em causa.
Considero que, com o voto de hoje, o Parlamento Europeu enviou um sinal forte e claro aos Estados-Membros que solicitam o congelamento do orçamento da União Europeia para 2014-2020.
Considero que, na União Europeia, é essencial apoiarmos esta iniciativa oportuna da OIT, uma vez que o desenvolvimento das nossas sociedades está repleto de tendências - sabemos quais são. A procura global de serviços domésticos continuará a aumentar, mas não podemos saudar a adopção de uma agenda do trabalho digno da OIT enquanto deixamos toda uma secção do mercado de trabalho sem regulamentação e sem a protecção de qualquer legislação.
Considero que, para alcançar este objectivo, necessitamos de criar um acto legislativo de fácil aplicação, flexível e claro que, quando possível, tenha carácter vinculativo para os Estados-Membros e que facilite e proporcione segurança jurídica às partes contratantes, sem interferir nas legislações nacionais e sem afectar as partes mais fracas do ponto de vista financeiro.
Considero ser este o procedimento certo para o Parlamento amanhã: avançar, resolver as divergências que ainda temos com o Conselho, mas olhar para o futuro num momento em que a crise está a atingir todos os europeus.
Considero também muito útil saber que a Comissão não se limitou a proporcionar ajuda directa no momento exacto, mas que, em nome da Europa no seu conjunto, também se ocupou intensamente da questão de saber que conclusões há a retirar da catástrofe, em termos de medidas de protecção civil, de sistemas de intercâmbio de informações, bem como de investigação e estudos conexos. Não estou absolutamente convicto da necessidade absoluta de apresentar novos estudos. É possível que tenhamos necessidade de proceder a uma avaliação do material de que já dispomos para verificarmos se é suficiente para as nossas necessidades.
Considero também que o enfoque no emprego e nas condições de trabalho dignas constitui um elemento fundamental do desenvolvimento sustentável, e não apenas nos países da UE. A exemplo do relator, também eu lamento o facto de não existir uma definição única de "cláusula social” que possa ser utilizada não nos acordos comerciais bilaterais, mas na criação de condições de emprego dignas para os trabalhadores.
Considero também que é muito importante melhorar a eficácia das despesas administrativas da UE, e uma das formas de o conseguir consiste em aumentar a transparência do processo de distribuição e de utilização destas despesas.
Considero também uma boa ideia aprofundar a integração dos sistemas educativos a nível internacional, em primeiro lugar para garantir o reconhecimento total das qualificações das pessoas e, em segundo lugar, para promover projectos de mobilidade transfronteiriça. Por último, concordo plenamente com a sugestão do Parlamento à Comissão no sentido de esta proceder às necessárias adaptações no Fundo Social Europeu, no programa Erasmus e no Programa de Aprendizagem ao Longo da Vida, a fim de garantir a afectação de fundos a projectos específicos de ensino e de formação e a projectos de luta contra o desemprego dos jovens e a descriminação em função do sexo, encorajando uma maior participação das mulheres nesses projectos.
Considero totalmente inaceitável a ideia de o Reino Unido e a França prescindirem do seu lugar no Conselho de Segurança das Nações Unidas a fim de permitir que a UE se torne membro daquele órgão. Não creio que nenhum desses Estados-Membros esteja disposto a fazê-lo. Infelizmente, o Tratado de Lisboa incentiva-o e, tal como já referi, essa é uma das razões pelas quais nos opomos tão vigorosamente a ele.
Considero vital que os jovens e as várias organizações de jovens estejam envolvidos no processo decisório.
Considero, contudo, que o relatório é insuficiente num domínio importante, na medida em que não responde à pergunta fundamental colocada pelos nossos contribuintes e pelos nossos consumidores que pagam a política agrícola comum: para que servem os pagamentos directos dissociados? Essa é uma pergunta fundamental que todos temos de encarar. Já não existe qualquer ligação com a produção de alimentos, porque os pagamentos directos estão dissociados.
Considero, no entanto, particularmente questionável que, neste domínio, estejamos a pensar actuar com base no princípio da acção voluntária, por outras palavras, permitindo que, tal como anteriormente, os Estados que não desejem aderir a esta Eurovinheta, simplesmente, não a apliquem.
Considero, por conseguinte, que o Conselho deve atribuir excepcionalmente o título de Capital Europeia da Cultura 2014 a Sarajevo.
Considero, por isso, fundamental que as verbas para a política de coesão sejam pelo menos mantidas nos mesmos montantes, assim como as verbas para a política agrícola comum. É ainda importante que se avance para um quadro financeiro plurianual cujas receitas não dependam em mais de 80 % dos orçamentos nacionais.
Considero, por isso, que esta é uma área em que se, por um lado, a harmonização máxima poderá ser útil, por outro poderá também ser adoptada harmonização mínima em função do tipo contratual, por ser mais adequada.
Considero, portanto, que as relações políticas e comerciais da UE e dos seus Estados-Membros com a Mongólia devem continuar a ser desenvolvidas.
Considero, porém, que algumas das medidas incluídas nessa estratégia poderiam ser, talvez, alargadas à Mongólia, tendo em conta a sua história cultural, que é semelhante à dos outros países. O país possui, actualmente, o estatuto de observador na Organização para a Segurança e a Cooperação na Europa, e a União Europeia está a analisar a possibilidade de o ajudar a tornar-se um membro de pleno direito, atendendo aos laços culturais antigos que existem entre a Europa e a Mongólia.
Consigo entender, em parte, a sua abordagem. V. Exa. afirma que se deixarmos Assad fora da lista, talvez isso o ajude a mudar de atitude mais tarde.
Constatamos também a necessidade de efectuar uma revisão do sistema de recursos próprios da UE. O sistema actual é muito complicado e carece de transparência.
Constatando o facto de, em geral, os acordos de comércio livre ainda conterem poucas referências a normas sociais, o relatório aponta alguns caminhos, nomeadamente a cláusula social e o respeito das convenções da Organização Internacional do Trabalho (OIT) - tenham ou não sido já ratificadas por todos os Estados-Membros -, bem como o reforço da cooperação entre países terceiros e Estados-Membros. O desenvolvimento do conceito de responsabilidade social das empresas é outro aspecto interessante do relatório, porque, embora seja já um conceito útil, continua a basear-se na participação voluntária, o que deixa margem para aperfeiçoamentos.
Constato com grande satisfação que a nova política agrícola comum irá pôr termo ao período de discriminação contra os agricultores de determinados EstadosMembros, incluindo do meu país. Gostaria de agradecer ao relator pelo seu trabalho, que é claramente o trabalho de um autor que compreende as questões envolvidas. A tentativa de estabelecimento de novas condições discriminatórias deixa-me muito preocupado. A imposição de limites para os pagamentos directos é uma nova forma de discriminação contra os EstadosMembros, nos quais, por razões históricas, a maior parte das explorações agrícolas têm grandes dimensões. Estas empresas agrícolas cumprem as mesmas regras e prestam os mesmos serviços que as pequenas explorações noutros países, satisfazendo tão bem como elas os requisitos dos pagamentos directos. A discriminação das grandes explorações através da imposição de um limite máximo para os pagamentos directos pode ter como consequência a eliminação de postos de trabalho nas zonas rurais e pode asfixiar o potencial de inovação. Como poderemos falar com credibilidade num mercado único, se aceitarmos a imposição de condições discriminatórias para determinados EstadosMembros como um tratamento diferenciado nos pagamentos por hectare ou a imposição de um limite máximo para os pagamentos directos?
Constato, infelizmente, que as ambições da Estratégia 2020 não estão visivelmente em sintonia com a realidade das restrições orçamentais, que cortaram substancialmente o financiamento dos principais programas comunitários na área da educação. Aplaudo as medidas adoptadas pela Comissão que visam assegurar uma maior permeabilidade, transparência e comparabilidade do processo de reconhecimento no âmbito dos sistemas de formação e entre eles. É igualmente importante que os Estados-Membros iniciem uma reforma dos seus sistemas e reforcem a orientação do ensino e da formação profissional para as verdadeiras necessidades do mercado de trabalho.
Constitui um primeiro passo no sentido de proporcionar mais transparência no trabalho das Instituições e assegurar o cumprimento das regras da União em matéria de administração pública. O Registo de Transparência, como será chamado a partir de agora, não é obrigatório, contudo os indivíduos ou organizações de representação de interesses serão forçados a registar-se caso pretendam obter autorização para ter acesso ao Parlamento Europeu.
Constitui, simultaneamente, uma confirmação do modo como a cooperação policial e judiciária consegue, numa abordagem transfronteiriça da criminalidade, alcançar objectivos importantes.
Constituirá um passo importante no caminho em direcção à plena participação em Schengen. O Conselho vai continuar a monitorizar os novos progressos em todas as áreas, uma vez que o acompanhamento adequado é um exercício contínuo em todos os países Schengen. A este respeito, posso assegurar aos senhores deputados que a Bulgária e a Roménia continuarão a informar regularmente sobre as medidas tomadas para corrigirem as deficiências remanescentes.
Contamos com a experiência para ajudar todos os países que solicitem agora que os ajudemos a trilhar esse caminho para a democracia. É por isso que proponho que apoiemos a criação de um fundo para a democracia que nos permitirá, também, utilizar os nossos recursos para apoiar as oportunidades, em particular para os jovens, de participar na vida política, para apoiar o desenvolvimento de partidos políticos, para permitir às pessoas fazer o que os senhores deputados fazem em muitos países aqui representados - isto é, desenvolver o processo político criando esses partidos políticos, a sociedade civil, e raízes profundas susceptíveis de permitir o desenvolvimento e a consolidação da democracia.
Contamos que até ao fim de Junho fique concluído o processo de nomeação de um novo director-geral do Fundo Monetário Internacional (FMI), para suceder a Dominique Strauss-Kahn, acusado, como todos sabemos, de um crime muito grave que, infelizmente, deve ter afectado também a reputação do FMI.
Contempla os meios necessários para a competitividade das empresas, para a segurança alimentar, para garantir preços justos aos consumidores e para fornecer à sociedade bens públicos, protegidos por cada vez mais salvaguardas.
Continua a inscrever-se, assim, na mesma lógica ultra-liberal de integração europeia que temos vindo a condenar há vários anos, uma lógica que está centrada, acima de tudo, no mercado e nas suas necessidades.
Continua, de facto, a preferir avançar cada vez mais dinheiro e fazer empréstimo sobre empréstimo numa sucessão interminável a economias que estão em situação muito difícil e mesmo à beira do colapso, ou será que começa a despontar aqui algum senso e já se está a pôr seriamente a hipótese de reestruturação das dívidas públicas, que, para mim, é inevitável a longo prazo?
Continua-se a defender a sujeição da agricultura às regras da OMC e, desta forma, a promover modelos de produção intensiva, de cariz exportador, em detrimento da produção e do consumo locais, social e ambientalmente sustentáveis. A redistribuição das verbas da PAC defendida, tendo em conta a profunda injustiça hoje existente (entre países, produtores e produções), não pode ser dissociada da garantia de minimização das perdas por parte dos grandes beneficiários...
Continuais a repetir acusações injustificadas, embora já as tenhamos refutado e tenhamos provado a nossa posição repetidas vezes, mas dir-vos-ei mais uma vez: a nova constituição húngara não proíbe o aborto. A nova constituição húngara não lesa a liberdade de religião e a liberdade de consciência. A nova constituição húngara não limita os direitos dos casais homossexuais. A nova constituição húngara não tem competência para além do perímetro geográfico do país e fornece uma protecção jurídica forte e sem paralelo às nacionalidades contidas no seu território. A nova constituição húngara não enfraquece, mas sim reforça o princípio da divisão de poderes e o sistema de pesos e contrapesos. A nova constituição húngara é uma constituição europeia em espírito, nascida da vontade de garantir todos os direitos humanos fundamentais aos seus cidadãos e no espírito da cooperação e da unidade das nações. Na nossa constituição, existem 18 referências à Europa, e nela incluímos também o lema da União Europeia "Unida na diversidade".
Continuamos a atribuir grande importância ao objecto de restringir o aquecimento global a 2°C. Por essa razão, adoptámos metas a curto e médio prazos para 2020 e uma estratégia a longo prazo para 2050. É claro que temos de analisar também os estádios intermédios entre 2020 e 2050 e definir metas intercalares adicionais.
Continuamos empenhados numa política de "uma só China", embora ultimamente Pequim se tenha revelado mais repressiva e violenta tanto no Tibete como na região do Uigur.
Continuaram a alegar que apenas tinham emitido um parecer, embora soubessem perfeitamente que as suas classificações eram, efectivamente, utilizadas como um selo de aprovação. O meu relatório enumera muitas deficiências e apresenta propostas na esperança de que a Comissão possa porventura incluir algumas delas na sua proposta legislativa que apresentará no Outono.
Continuaremos a lutar por um melhor pacote económico.
Continuo a acreditar que a questão da rastreabilidade afecta a competitividade das PME e - assim como o meu empenho prioritário, desde o início da minha nomeação como Comissário Europeu, tem sido a política a favor das PME, prosseguindo dessa forma o trabalho do meu antecessor - tenciono continuar a proteger a saúde dos consumidores mediante produtos de qualidade que serão os únicos competitivos no mercado internacional, uma vez que a competitividade dos produtos da União Europeia se mede em termos de qualidade. É por isso que eu penso que é importante continuarmos a trabalhar nesse sentido.
Continuo a acreditar que um mandado de detenção europeu é uma ferramenta necessária para combater a criminalidade e o terrorismo em toda a União, particularmente em virtude da enorme quantidade de pessoas que actualmente circulam livremente entre os Estados-Membros, incluindo - infelizmente - os criminosos.
Continuo a esperar que possamos ter uma visão mais actualizada dos acordos de investimento do que foi o caso com muitos destes antigos acordos, em que fomos nós a investir noutros países.
Continuo, no entanto, a nutrir uma série de preocupações. Em primeiro lugar, o procedimento de recuperação dos fundos empregues indevidamente é muito moroso.
Continuo, porém, a pensar que os Estados-Membros acreditam muito menos nisso do que nós. Por isso, convém assinalar - como foi também reiterado pela Baronesa Ashton esta manhã e noutras ocasiões - que, se a Europa não deixar de ser parcialmente económica e não se tornar mais política, muito provavelmente também não poderemos desempenhar o nosso papel tão bem como poderíamos.
Conto com a inteligência e a eficiência dos meus colegas deputados.
Contrafacção, imitações, produtos de custo extremamente baixo, vindos do Extremo Oriente, e por aí adiante, deixaram de rastos o nosso sector têxtil e de produção e a Europa ignora cada um dos nossos pedidos. A ausência da marcação de origem é, infelizmente, apenas a última má ideia.
Contrariamente à convicção generalizada no nacionalismo, não necessitamos de menos Europa, mas de mais Europa.
Contribuem para a coesão social, para tornar as regiões mais atractivas e para a influência da União Europeia no mundo. É tempo de se criar um ímpeto, à escala da UE, capaz de desbloquear o seu potencial e estimular o seu desenvolvimento.
Contribuindo para uma tomada de decisões ponderada e plenamente informada, o que deverá conduzir a uma melhor qualidade da legislação, uma mais correcta transposição, aplicação e fiscalização, bem como a uma maior celeridade no processo legislativo.
Contribuir para mitigar as consequências das catástrofes deverá constituir um elemento importante da política externa da UE. Estas acções não devem estar associadas ao envio de forças militares. O envio de forças policiais deverá acontecer apenas em casos extremos, com base numa resolução da ONU, e com o objectivo de proteger os trabalhadores nos sectores da saúde, social e de serviços públicos, bem como para formar a polícia. A Política Externa e de Segurança Comum deve ser rigorosamente separada da NATO.
Contribuiria para a simplificação dos procedimentos a harmonização das regras de gestão, elegibilidade, auditoria e comunicação dos projectos financiados pelo Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento Regional, o Fundo Social Europeu, o Fundo de Coesão, o Fundo Europeu Agrícola para o Desenvolvimento Rural e o Fundo Europeu das Pescas.
Contribuiu com 2,6% do PIB da UE e foi responsável por 3,1% dos postos de trabalho na União Europeia, o que representava 5,8 milhões de pessoas.
Controlo não pode significar burocracia, pois esta é sempre um custo desnecessário. O princípio da confiança nas instituições deve prevalecer.
Contudo, a Comissão e os Estados-Membros têm de intensificar os seus esforços para transformar as indústrias culturais e criativas num sector nuclear da economia europeia.
Contudo, a União Europeia possui também uma dimensão constitucional, na medida em que não só a arquitectura das suas instituições está sujeita ao direito, como também estão consagradas no direito garantias para proteger a posição dos indivíduos face aos poderes públicos no espaço europeu, além de existir um princípio essencial, o da democracia, que exalta o pluralismo.
Contudo, a coesão também é sensata, de um ponto de vista económico, e necessária.
Contudo, a forma como o Mandado foi utilizado conduziu igualmente, como todos afirmaram, a abusos e a práticas abusivas: práticas abusivas quando é utilizado para delitos menores, e não me refiro aqui aos múltiplos casos ridículos de furtos de bicicletas, leitões e produtos afins, mas das práticas abusivas muito mais graves quando ocorrem detenções desproporcionadas, quando cidadãos inocentes são detidos e quando o direito ao recurso destas decisões é violado.
Contudo, a gestão uniforme da crise, à escala europeia, traduzida num regime linguístico comum, não se pautou pelo profissionalismo. A caça patológica para localizar o foco de contaminação levou a acusações de culpa prematuras a torto e a direito, e tais argumentos redundaram em cabeçalhos adversos durante dias a fio e na incerteza total por parte dos consumidores.
Contudo, a nossa aceitação da componente macroeconómica está dependente da manutenção de uma abordagem simétrica, e este é um argumento que quero defender perante o Conselho.
Contudo, a política de ajuda aos governos com a compra das suas dívidas pelo Banco Central Europeu não pode continuar por muito mais tempo, porquanto está a aproximar-se dos limites. O Banco Central Europeu já detém 360 mil milhões de euros em instrumentos financeiros que não são livremente negociados para além de outros 480 mil milhões de euros em títulos com garantias reduzidas. É, portanto, um pacemaker, para os titulares de maus activos financeiros.
Contudo, a posição seguida pela Comissão no caso presente, não deve ser considerada um precedente. A Comissão prosseguirá os seus esforços, com o objectivo de encontrar, em conjunto com o Parlamento Europeu e o Conselho, uma solução adequada para esta questão institucional horizontal".
Contudo, a posição seguida pela Comissão não deve, no caso presente, ser considerada como um precedente. A Comissão prosseguirá os seus esforços, com o objectivo de encontrar, em conjunto com o Parlamento Europeu e o Conselho, uma solução adequada para esta questão institucional horizontal.
Contudo, a rastreabilidade em relação à origem dos géneros alimentícios é fundamental quando se trata da segurança alimentar.
Contudo, a relação económica UE-Canadá não alcançou o seu potencial máximo e um acordo de comércio livre UE-Canadá muito pode contribuir para a desenvolver e concretizar, melhorando os fluxos comerciais e de investimento, eliminando os picos pautais, bem como entraves não pautais, e apoiando uma cooperação mais estreita, nomeadamente em matéria de cooperação regulamentar, de mobilidade laboral e de reconhecimento de qualificações. Acolho de bom grado um acordo com o Canadá que transcenda os compromissos assumidos no âmbito da OMC e seja complementar às regras multilaterais, conquanto as negociações conduzam a um acordo equilibrado, ambicioso, qualitativamente elevado e que vise mais do que meras reduções pautais, e desde que comecem a ser aplicados outros mecanismos.
Contudo, a solidariedade deve basear-se em valores partilhados, e todos os grupos deste Parlamento são responsáveis pela defesa desses valores.
Contudo, a solução está sobretudo nas mãos dos países, pois só eles podem reorganizar e reformar os sistemas de ensino nacionais e ajustá-los às novas realidades socioeconómicas. A missão da UE é criar um quadro para os processos e evitar que os Estados-Membros percam de vista o objectivo original, incentivando-os e motivando-os, ao mesmo tempo, a executar reformas que são difíceis a curto prazo mas certamente compensadoras a longo prazo.
Contudo, a sua universalidade suscita dúvidas quanto à sua capacidade para ter em conta um conjunto de indicadores fundamentais para a qualidade de vida num determinado país. Além disso, alguns parâmetros importantes são interpretados incorrectamente. A Comissão entende que é essencial desenvolver um indicador que retrate claramente a situação no país em causa e que reflicta a situação dos agregados familiares e dos indivíduos, bem como o nível de eficiência na exploração dos recursos do país e o estado do ambiente. A Comissão espera um maior envolvimento dos Estados-Membros na sistematização da investigação sobre a qualidade da vida pública, o que permitiria realizar comparações claras entre países.
Contudo, a tarefa desta comissão especial era determinar os montantes de que necessitamos para poder dar uma resposta adequada aos novos desafios políticos que enfrentamos.
Contudo, a verdade é que a jurisdição territorial e os direitos de propriedade são a única base segura para a conservação. Se analisarmos os países que seguiram políticas de conservação bem-sucedidas nas pescas - as Ilhas Falkland, a Islândia, a Noruega ou a Nova Zelândia -, todos eles o conseguiram proporcionando aos comandantes das embarcações um sentimento de pertença para que pudessem ter um incentivo para tratar as pescas como um recurso renovável. É a sabedoria essencial de Aristóteles segundo a qual aquilo que não pertence a ninguém não será cuidado por ninguém.
Contudo, a verdade é que, neste contexto, demos passo numa direcção que nos permitirá realizar progressos mais tarde.
Contudo, acredito que o acordo deve ser equilibrado, privilegiando trocas justas.
Contudo, antes de o aplicarmos, devemos investigar mais sobre as possibilidades de adaptar o novo método no dia-a-dia.
Contudo, ao mesmo tempo, é preciso dizer que todas as regiões devem ter acesso à política de coesão, tanto nos Estados-Membros da Europa Oriental como em economias nacionais fortes como a Alemanha. A Alemanha Oriental necessita de apoio.
Contudo, apenas será possível alcançar o êxito se as outras vozes se calarem ou, pelo menos, se falarem mais baixo. O que ouvimos, pelo contrário, foi um coro de indignação. Até agora, o que temos para oferecer ao mundo é uma cacofonia, em que muitas vezes temos dificuldade em ouvir a mensagem importante que a União Europeia deseja transmitir.
Contudo, aquilo com que estes vigaristas, sobretudo, contam é com o conhecimento insuficiente da lei por parte das instituições responsáveis e, lamentavelmente, com a sua falta de vontade e de coragem, em muitos casos, e até uma certa indolência. A sua interpretação formalista da lei permite-lhes evitar um maior envolvimento, evitar levar estes casos a tribunal e lavar as mãos desta situação. Paradoxalmente, desta forma são os interesses dos vigaristas que se protegem e não os das vítimas.
Contudo, as AI não se substituem, de forma alguma, ao discurso político e ao processo de decisão democrático da autoridade legislativa, servindo exclusivamente para a preparação de uma decisão política do ponto de vista técnico.
Contudo, as propostas de reforma do Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento estão incompletas: confundem estabilidade com ajuste, e confiam as políticas de crescimento ao mercado e à esfera nacional. Não é aceitável que se evite o empenho da Europa no investimento e no emprego.
Contudo, as soluções que o relatório apresenta vão no sentido de aprofundamento desses mesmos mecanismos de mercado responsáveis pela actual crise de volatilidade dos preços e desigualdade de distribuição dos rendimentos ao longo da cadeia de produção. Por este motivo, abstive-me.
Contudo, as tentativas de associar aqueles que, como nós, estão fora da área do euro a objectivos e processos destinados a harmonizar a política económica são inaceitáveis. Não pretendo ver a área do euro atravessar dificuldades prolongadas, mas o ECR não pode apoiar legislação da UE que retire mais poderes aos governos nacionais que estão actualmente fora dessa área do euro.
Contudo, as universidades devem manter a independência e o carácter público e os seus cursos devem conservar a sua orientação académica, assente na investigação. O ensino superior na União Europeia não deve limitar-se a reproduzir os modelos que criaram a crise e a perda de confiança. Pelo contrário, deve ter como objectivo criar novos padrões de coesão social e reforçar o carácter colectivo que os valores humanitários e um sistema europeu de classificação das universidades neles baseado possam desenvolver na direcção certa.
Contudo, atrevo-me a dizer que acabou por prevalecer o sentido pragmático de emergência que nos ajudou a cooperar com o objectivo de conter a crise da dívida soberana e proteger a recuperação económica.
Contudo, como deputado alemão deste Parlamento, não posso chegar aqui e afirmar que tudo está a correr bem.
Contudo, como procuramos evitar entrar num debate com o sector médico, a indústria farmacêutica e o sector da pecuária intensiva - há muito a abordar nestas frentes - também não estamos a ser tão coerentes como temos obrigação de ser na forma como lidamos com a questão da resistência aos antibióticos. A resistência ao EHEC e a resistência aos antibióticos são, ambos, problemas de monta.
Contudo, como se demonstrou uma vez mais, não dispomos de dados suficientes.
Contudo, como é óbvio, esse facto não deveria isentar a Comissão Europeia do seu dever de continuar a atormentar os Estados-Membros a este respeito e de pressionar os serviços de segurança nacionais para que investiguem realmente se as centrais também vão estar preparadas para esses riscos.
Contudo, considero que é insensato propor a introdução de um imposto sobre as transacções financeiras apenas na União Europeia.
Contudo, creio que há bons presságios de que o Japão deseja efectivamente lidar com o problema das barreiras não tarifárias. O Primeiro-Ministro japonês defendeu uma política de abertura do Japão, e isso será, em parte, porque reconhece que a indústria japonesa está a estiolar no seu actual ambiente. É também, obviamente, em parte devido ao impacto previsível do acordo de comércio livre UE-Coreia do Sul nas exportações japonesas, mas penso que, além disso, o apelo do primeiro-ministro reflecte o reconhecimento da reduzida experiência do Japão quando se trata da abertura ao exterior.
Contudo, dada a dependência do sector de combustíveis fósseis, e com vista à nova reforma, devem-se considerar em especial os esforços que se façam acompanhar de uma política inovadora, a par dos esforços já feitos até à data, de modo a dotar a frota pesqueira de maior eficácia em termos de energia. É por isso que o apoio à investigação nesta área constitui também um compromisso com a rendibilidade e uma oportunidade para os sectores ligados ao mercado de energia, como a construção naval, terem futuro e serem capazes de se reinventar.
Contudo, dado que este texto não tem consequências legislativas, pode ser aprovado apesar das suas sérias limitações.
Contudo, deve ser prestada especial atenção ao futuro da política de coesão, que considero um instrumento muito importante que presta apoio financeiro a investimentos que impulsionam o crescimento económico e, acima de tudo, a criação de novos postos de trabalho. A este respeito, gostaria de revisitar um ponto que me parece particularmente importante: a criação de uma nova categoria intermédia.
Contudo, devemos lutar por uma melhor coordenação e complementaridade dos fundos e por procedimentos simplificados.
Contudo, devemos todos estar cientes de que é agora necessário travar uma grande batalha em torno do orçamento, e é por esse motivo que lhe lançamos um apelo, Senhor Comissário, porque o senhor sabe-o melhor do que eu ou do que qualquer um de nós aqui presentes. Não podemos permitir que o orçamento da política agrícola comum seja reduzido, porque isso significaria que a agricultura vale menos na Europa.
Contudo, devo acrescentar que não quero ver o apoio à ecologização no âmbito do primeiro pilar impor mais encargos e custos aos nossos agricultores.
Contudo, do lado da UE, um acordo focalizado nos direitos aduaneiros não seria de modo algum suficiente. O problema com o Japão, na verdade, não são tanto os direitos aduaneiros mas antes o facto de os exportadores e os investidores da UE continuarem a deparar-se com todo o tipo de barreiras não tarifárias.
Contudo, ela informou o público em primeiro lugar e só muito mais tarde, horas ou meio-dia depois, é que informou a Comissão Europeia e as autoridades espanholas.
Contudo, embora reconheça a necessidade de fazer avançar este projecto, considerei necessário abster-me na votação final. O relatório do senhor deputado Remek afirma que a conclusão do sistema Galileu exigirá um financiamento adicional de até 1 900 milhões de euros no próximo quadro financeiro plurianual (QFP). No actual clima financeiro difícil, sou obrigada a opor-me a este aumento na despesa, especialmente tendo em conta que o programa já ultrapassou em 60 % o orçamento inicialmente previsto.
Contudo, entretanto, a Europa tem mostrado, essencialmente, que envidará quaisquer esforços para prejudicar, hoje e de futuro, os interesses dos seus cidadãos e das suas indústrias de qualidade.
Contudo, esta confiança pressupõe obrigações recíprocas.
Contudo, esta proposta deverá ser alterada durante a votação de amanhã a fim de assegurar que os dados recolhidos sejam fiáveis e conducentes ao debate, e também, acima de tudo, para assegurar o envolvimento de todos os Estados-Membros nesta abordagem.
Contudo, estamos profundamente preocupados com o facto de termos transferido para o Conselho a competência para definir prioridades.
Contudo, estará ciente que, no seu próprio Governo, uma das primeiras medidas da Ministra dos Assuntos Internos, Theresa May, foi aderir à Decisão Europeia de Investigação, o que significa que agora não poderemos optar por não participar e teremos de aceitar o resultado da máquina legislativa, uma vez que será objecto de votação por maioria qualificada e não poderemos determinar o resultado final? Estaremos perante outro exemplo de duplicidade de valores dos conservadores, em que criticam aqui as medidas da União Europeia e as defendem no seu próprio Parlamento nacional?
Contudo, estas agências apresentam alguns problemas, com particular destaque para a falta de concorrência, para as suas estruturas oligopolísticas e excesso de confiança atribuído e para a falta de transparência e de responsabilização. Tais questões assumem mais relevância nos tempos actuais, nomeadamente no que respeita aos Estados-Membros que, em virtude das suas dificuldades a nível económico e financeiro, vêem a notação de várias instituições nacionais variar de forma inconstante e com um fundamento de ordem cíclica.
Contudo, estas soluções de pouco valerão se, ao mesmo tempo, não apoiarmos os bancos europeus que ainda não se conseguem sustentar sozinhos.
Contudo, este facto implica igualmente que o Conselho (e não me refiro apenas à Hungria, mas aos Estados-Membros) nos auxilie na criação de garantias processuais, e na questão de períodos inaceitáveis de prisão preventiva para muitos cidadãos do meu próprio país.
Contudo, estes esforços foram rejeitados pela Hungria.
Contudo, estou profundamente preocupada com o facto de termos atribuído ao Conselho a competência para definir prioridades. O Parlamento Europeu deveria ter tido a coragem de definir prioridades.
Contudo, existe um mas: vivemos num período em que todos os Estados-Membros examinam três vezes cada euro antes de o gastar.
Contudo, gostaria de apresentar um bom exemplo de uma lacuna na Constituição que invalida a insistência do Tratado no Estado de direito.
Contudo, gostaria de sublinhar uma vez mais que a nossa preocupação sempre foi a elaboração de uma proposta para ajudar as áreas das regiões que, embora não se encontrando entre as muito pobres, estavam abaixo da média, e para providenciar apoio ao processo de recuperação. No entanto, compreendo as preocupações e as dúvidas que algumas pessoas manifestaram.
Contudo, há ainda alguns pontos que é preciso tomar em consideração e discutir. O acordo deve ter como objectivo, evidentemente, a concorrência leal, que só pode ser alcançada se forem removidas as barreiras tarifárias, não tarifárias e técnicas ao comércio. O princípio da reciprocidade tem de ser respeitado por ser essa a única forma de chegar a um resultado equilibrado nas negociações. O mesmo princípio aplica-se a aspectos específicos do país ou da cultura de cada um dos parceiros.
Contudo, importa recordar que temos de definir prioridades a todos os níveis, a nível europeu e também nos Estados-Membros.
Contudo, isto não significa que não tenhamos reparado nos pontos fracos do documento. É uma total perda de tempo desenvolver propostas para recursos próprios e impostos europeus.
Contudo, mantenho a opinião de que temos de assumir o desafio das categorias intermédias e da cláusula de salvaguarda para iniciar uma nova fase na política de coesão da Europa e também para concretizar, na política de coesão, o desenvolvimento mais equilibrado e sustentável que queremos proporcionar à Europa durante os próximos anos.
Contudo, na minha opinião, a Roménia e a Bulgária provaram agora que estão suficientemente preparadas para aplicar todas as disposições do acervo de Schengen de um modo satisfatório.
Contudo, nestas circunstâncias, não tenho objecção em dar seguimento ao pedido, neste caso específico, mas gostaria muito de pedir aos Senhores Deputados que não utilizassem em excesso esta possibilidade, porque, se o fizerem, então o Presidente deverá submeter à apreciação da Assembleia todos os casos e instalar-se-á um problema onde não deveria haver nenhum.
Contudo, no ano passado, a Polónia exigiu repentinamente a extradição deste empresário.
Contudo, nos termos do artigo 51.º, as disposições da Carta têm por destinatários as instituições, órgãos e organismos da União, na observância do princípio da subsidiariedade, bem como os Estados-Membros, apenas quando apliquem o direito da União.
Contudo, não devemos deixar-nos afundar ainda mais na guerra civil líbia, sob pena de nos tornarmos alvo do terrorismo e do extremismo.
Contudo, não deveríamos esforçar-nos por substituir a NATO por um novo exército da UE, devemos, sim, concentrar-nos na divisão adequada de tarefas quando ocorrem crises internacionais. O papel da UE poderia consistir na disponibilização de ajuda humanitária, cabendo à Aliança do Atlântico Norte seria a coordenação da ajuda militar.
Contudo, não está isento de falhas, como quando é emitido para crimes considerados pouco graves. Não espero que seja emitido um Mandado de Detenção Europeu quando alguém é apanhado a furtar dois pneus noutro país, como sucedeu no passado. O castigo não é proporcional ao crime e conduz a uma perda de confiança num instrumento importante e útil.
Contudo, não podemos esquecer a necessidade de que o trabalho doméstico - nem todo deve ser considerado precário, subvalorizado ou mal remunerado - represente de facto emprego digno.
Contudo, não podemos esquecer que a saída da crise também tem aspectos europeus: o plano de desenvolvimento económico; os regulamentos relativos ao mercado financeiro para evitar que esta crise se repita; as medidas actualmente em discussão sobre a governação económica da União Europeia; medidas da UE que apenas tornarão as medidas nacionais mais eficientes.
Contudo, não podemos inventar novos critérios de adesão ao espaço Schengen e não podemos pôr em causa a certeza de que um Estado pode fazer parte desse espaço logo que os critérios vigentes são preenchidos.
Contudo, não têm a liberdade de escolher, porque a sociedade atribui pouco ou nenhum valor ao trabalho das mulheres no lar e a cuidar dos filhos. O relatório apresentado não contém propostas para que os Estados atribuam um valor económico ao trabalho de criar e educar os filhos realizado pelas mães, pelo menos por comparação com os contributos dos Estados para o funcionamento dos jardins-de-infância.
Contudo, não é evidente, de todo, que, com recursos próprios que reduzam a dependência do rendimento nacional bruto, possamos esperar uma revolução nas capacidades da UE para financiar o crescimento e uma mudança estrutural.
Contudo, o PIB é uma medida da produção e não reflecte a sustentabilidade ambiental, a eficiência dos recursos, a inclusão social ou o progresso social em geral.
Contudo, o alargamento alterou o equilíbrio e a coordenação entre Estados-Membros. A mensagem da Europa mudou: tornou-se mais rica e mais complexa.
Contudo, o debate demonstrou igualmente que muitas das políticas laborais e sociais em questão se aplicam aos trabalhadores domésticos, apesar de serem considerados um grupo independente.
Contudo, o meu grupo sempre salientou igualmente que o sistema do Mandado de Detenção Europeu estaria incompleto sem uma evolução dos direitos processuais de defesa na Europa.
Contudo, o não encerramento de Guantánamo Bay é desapontante e temos de olhar também para nós próprios, na Europa. Não estamos dispostos a retirar os presos que restam e temos de esclarecer a participação em entregas e actos extrajudiciais, incluindo tortura, em solo Europeu.
Contudo, o que nós, na Comissão do Desenvolvimento Regional, requeremos é que este quadro único e a sua coordenação não fiquem confinados à fase de planeamento da política mas que se estendam de modo a cobrir todas as fases de definição das políticas: planeamento, execução e pagamentos, auditoria e avaliação.
Contudo, o reembolso virá do contribuinte comum: por outras palavras, a Irlanda, Portugal e a Grécia estão a arcar com os custos do apoio a todo o sistema bancário europeu.
Contudo, o relatório não descreve as políticas necessárias para aliviar o sofrimento deste país. Há muito tempo que demasiados países ignoram esta situação. Neste momento são necessárias políticas adequadas, através de um esforço concertado da comunidade internacional, destinadas a trazer paz e justiça a todos os cidadãos tão terrivelmente afectados por este conflito.
Contudo, o resultado é mitigado, uma vez que o objectivo da Comissão e do direito europeu é sobretudo o de facilitar o comércio transfronteiriço, e não o de harmonizar por cima a protecção dos consumidores. É, portanto, um pequeno passo para o consumidor francês, mas um grande passo para o consumidor europeu.
Contudo, os Estados-Membros ainda têm um longo caminho a percorrer para afectar 0,7% do seu rendimento nacional bruto à cooperação para o desenvolvimento.
Contudo, os cuidados especiais destinados às crianças dos grupos de maior risco devem ser prestados com muita sensibilidade, a fim de evitar estigmatizar estas crianças ou estas famílias, o que poderá aumentar o risco de exclusão social.
Contudo, os estudos sobre esta fase da aprendizagem, assim como o relevo que lhe é dado no contexto geral do ensino, são residuais, com reflexos nefastos, por exemplo, para quem cresça em famílias mais desfavorecidas, onde, amiúde, o desenvolvimento cognitivo das crianças é menos estimulado.
Contudo, os germes resistentes em animais podem ser transmitidos aos seres humanos e representam um grande risco para a saúde - o resultado pode mesmo ser o desenvolvimento de resistência aos antibióticos nos seres humanos. Não podíamos, portanto, deixar de votar favoravelmente o relatório em apreço para permitir finalmente a promoção da produção pecuária que dispensa a utilização de substâncias antimicrobianas.
Contudo, os produtores agrícolas também têm de estar protegidos contra riscos financeiros incalculáveis. A política de promoção das zonas agrícolas e rurais deve visar, em moldes coerentes, uma clara descentralização das estruturas de produção e comercialização de géneros alimentícios.
Contudo, os progressos variam consideravelmente entre países e entre temas, com taxas de selecção agregadas a cerca de 40% no caso de nove Estados-Membros e inferiores a 20% em quatro Estados-Membros. É óbvio que ainda existem disparidades económicas, sociais e ambientais flagrantes entre as regiões europeias.
Contudo, os senhores exigem um aumento mínimo de 5% no orçamento da União. Que ridículo! Que negação da soberania nacional e que desprezo pelos cidadãos e pelos governos dos nossos países.
Contudo, para atingir maiores e melhores resultados no futuro, é necessário simplificar o processo administrativo, aumentar a participação das pequenas e médias empresas, apoiar a inovação e adoptar mecanismos de financiamento de partilha de riscos. O relatório aborda igualmente a aprovação entre a União e os Estados-Membros de um plano europeu de investigação ambicioso em matéria de tecnologia e defesa a fim de consolidar a política europeia de defesa.
Contudo, para estarmos seguros, deveriam aplicar-se critérios idênticos a instalações existentes ou projectadas na vizinhança da UE (Rússia, Bielorrússia, Turquia, Arménia, Suíça e Ucrânia). Temos de falar a uma só voz enquanto lutamos sistematicamente nesse sentido.
Contudo, para o fazermos, também temos de ser capazes de alterar a nossa visão do orçamento da UE.
Contudo, para que os benefícios reais dos programas sejam alcançados, é necessário estabelecer uma estratégia, a médio e longo prazo, no que diz respeito ao financiamento e à governação, integrando as principais acções a realizar. Só assim será possível criar a confiança necessária nos mercados e, consequentemente, cativar os investimentos e a compra das aplicações e serviços.
Contudo, para sermos, ao mesmo tempo, credíveis quando pedimos mais recursos, devemos também ter a coragem de analisar as estruturas e os custos existentes. A nossa credibilidade aumentará significativamente se conseguirmos demonstrar que também somos capazes de redistribuir, reorientar e economizar fundos antes de pedirmos mais.
Contudo, partilho a opinião expressa no relatório de que temos de ser práticos e realistas.
Contudo, penso, na verdade, que é necessário efectuar uma avaliação fundamental evolução da política de coesão porque, uma vez que cada vez mais regiões ultrapassam o limiar dos 75%, a política torna-se redundante ou tem de ser reformada, e é isso que esperamos que aconteça.
Contudo, pergunto a esta Assemblei se a causa da liberdade individual no mundo, no respeito pela lei, não seria mais bem servida se o Parlamento se interessasse mais pelas operações do Mandado de Detenção Europeu, o qual, pela sua natureza, contorna e evita as protecções jurídicas contra a detenção arbitrária, e existem 500 milhões de pessoas na Europa que dele são alvo, ao passo que agora há apenas 171 detidos em Guantánamo.
Contudo, permanecem em aberto duas questões importantes, que são indissociáveis dos debates políticos. A primeira é a suspensão das transferências ao abrigo do Regulamento de Dublin e a segunda é o acesso das autoridades responsáveis pela aplicação da lei ao abrigo do Regulamento Eurodac.
Contudo, pessoalmente, estou extremamente preocupada com o que não fizemos, ou seja, definir prioridades.
Contudo, procedimentos administrativos tão complicados já não são proporcionais, especialmente porque outro regulamento da UE impõe uma obrigação de indicação do país de origem de um produto nos documentos aduaneiros antes da introdução em prática livre no mercado da UE, e a protecção do consumidor também está a ser reforçada actualmente na UE aumentando a quantidade de informações fornecidas aos consumidores.
Contudo, quando se trate de pedir dados-chave aos Estados-Membros, a UE não deve fugir às questões sensíveis.
Contudo, quero sublinhar que o sucesso da política económica europeia deve também passar por medidas complementares a estas, que apoiem o investimento e o crescimento dos EstadosMembros. A Europa deve apostar numa estratégia comum, no entanto, não deve esquecer os particularismos nacionais.
Contudo, relativamente a esta questão, temos sempre de ter em conta o nível de desempenho que queremos ver no futuro, por um lado, para a rede de primeira geração e, por outro lado, para os operadores de cabo e todas as outras entidades com interesses no espectro, nomeadamente as organizações de socorro e emergência.
Contudo, sabendo quão pouco rigorosos os Estados-Membros são no cumprimento da proibição de exportação, existem bons motivos para que a Comissão também controle de perto as acções dos Estados-Membros no que respeita ao REEE e outra legislação que estipula como devem eliminar este tipo de produto.
Contudo, se a União Europeia fracassar enquanto projecto transnacional de garantia da paz e da prosperidade, será mais do que uma união política a despedaçar-se. Os demónios do século XX que mergulharam este continente na desgraça voltarão rapidamente. A defesa da Europa é mais do que uma cimeira europeia - é a defesa de uma grande ideia.
Contudo, se os Estados coordenassem as suas políticas e o seu financiamento nos domínios prioritários, conseguiriam melhores resultados e economizariam mais fundos do que aqueles que queremos acrescentar ao orçamento comum da UE. Não existe, portanto, melhor alternativa do que a que estamos a discutir hoje.
Contudo, sinto-me na obrigação de fazer uma advertência.
Contudo, somos acusados de sermos maus gestores: penso que temos de intensificar os nossos esforços de comunicação. Peço, portanto, que parem de tratar o orçamento europeu como um ónus para as finanças nacionais.
Contudo, são muitos os domínios que podem contribuir para criar sinergias ou economias de escala: o Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa, a ajuda humanitária e a protecção civil, o agrupamento dos recursos nos domínios da defesa, da investigação e da inovação, os grandes projectos de infra-estruturas (em particular nos domínios da energia e do transporte).
Contudo, tal como referido pela Baronesa Ashton no mês passado após o julgamento Khodorkovsky/Lebedev, e como concluído pelo Tribunal Europeu dos Direitos do Homem em várias ocasiões, os verdadeiros progressos exigem respeito pela democracia e pelos direitos humanos e um quadro jurídico estável e justo para a actividade empresarial, os quais, na maioria das vezes, não existem na Rússia. A existência de um diálogo estruturado da sociedade civil e de medidas comuns para combater as alterações climáticas iriam contribuir para o aumento da confiança. O urso russo ainda padece, contudo, de algumas dores de cabeça, pelo que recomendo à Comissão que leve para Nizhny Novgorod não só um frasco de mel como também uma grande rede.
Contudo, talvez devêssemos acordar que, futuramente, por motivos pedagógicos, nas declarações finais o Senhor Comissário apenas responderá aos oradores que de facto se encontram presentes nesta Câmara.
Contudo, também em termos legais, a proposta da Comissão está em conflito com os artigos 78.º e 80.º da Convenção. No caso de um Estado-Membro estar a sofrer uma pressão intensa por parte da imigração, a Convenção declara expressamente que a Europa deverá providenciar apoio e solidariedade. O restabelecimento dos controlos das fronteiras internas não é solidariedade, é uma punição. Não distribui de forma equitativa o encargo da pressão nas fronteiras externas, através do reforço da Frontex; põe um encargo ainda maior sobre o Estado-Membro.
Contudo, tem de ser definido quem deve emitir um alerta e quando, quem deve subsequentemente assumir a responsabilidade pelos alertas, e quando deve a Comissão Europeia intervir no processo.
Contudo, tenho algumas dúvidas quanto à avaliação qualitativa do trabalho desenvolvido até agora. A título de exemplo, gostaria de referir o Anexo da análise redigido pela Comissão Europeia. O Anexo apresenta exemplos de algumas boas práticas, entre elas, na parte relativa ao mercado único, refere o facto de 22 Estados-Membros terem criado balcões únicos.
Contudo, todas as opções devem ser mantidas em aberto e estudadas.
Contudo, todos partilhamos os valores da liberdade, da equidade e da igualdade de todas as pessoas e todos os Estados-Membros. O que não devemos tolerar é a própria intolerância.
Contudo, trata-se de um mero indicador de riqueza, cujas potencialidades para aferir o desenvolvimento social são mais reduzidas. O sucesso do PIB advém, em grande medida, da sua simplicidade, em prejuízo, pois, da completude dos resultados alcançados.
Contudo, um orçamento virado para o futuro implica também uma mudança de prioridades e ainda mais fundos europeus. A terceira prioridade diz respeito aos recursos próprios da UE. Quando tornarmos o sistema mais justo e mais transparente, poderemos falar sobre recursos próprios.
Contudo, uma solução europeia implica financiamento europeu. O meu grupo procura adaptar este financiamento às novas realidades da Europa, quer nos seus objectivos quer nas suas modalidades. A minha pergunta ao Conselho é a seguinte: será a Europa da década de 2020 idêntica à Europa da década de 1960? É possível comparar o estado das finanças públicas dos nossos Estados-Membros, as nossas perspectivas de crescimento e a posição da Europa no mundo? Penso que não. É evidente que a Europa de hoje já não é, de modo algum, comparável à Europa dos pais fundadores. A Europa mudou, e seria irresponsável não reflectir essas alterações nas formas como a Europa é financiada, por outras palavras, no modo como a Europa é concebida.
Contudo, uma tal abordagem terá de respeitar o princípio de que o apoio financeiro não poderá, seja sob que circunstâncias for, aumentar o esforço de pesca.
Contudo, uma vez que há alguns pontos no relatório que são típicos da política de Bolonha em matéria de educação, à qual me oponho, nomeadamente quando se refere a necessidade de formular programas coerentes com as "necessidades do mercado” - o que pode, na minha opinião, pôr em causa a natureza do programa - abstive-me da votação.
Contudo, à parte a vertente sanitária da crise, cumpre chamar a atenção para as suas repercussões económicas. O sector hortofrutícola espanhol quantifica em 200 milhões de euros semanais os prejuízos económicos causados pelos erros de comunicação fatais de que hoje temos conhecimento.
Contudo, é bom que os representantes de grupos de interesses possuam agora um maior incentivo para aderir ao registo, pois, de outra forma, não entrarão no Parlamento Europeu. Há também melhor acesso à informação relativa aos representantes de grupos de interesses, incluindo os seus nomes, e devo aplaudir também o facto de os representantes de grupos de interesses que não cumpram as regras ficarem sujeitos a diversas penalidades, por exemplo, podem ser excluídos do registo, ou seja, ficar na lista negra. A questão que se coloca é a de saber se estas medidas são suficientes.
Contudo, é extremamente importante que a força de trabalho que as pequenas e médias empresas empregam seja mais qualificada do que é actualmente. É especialmente importante que elas possam participar na execução do programa de Economia Verde e adquirir competências na área digital. A coisa mais importante para nós é que os jovens empreendedores com pequenas e médias empresas não encarem diferentes formas de empresas como perdedoras mas sim como vencedoras.
Contudo, é igualmente importante tomar medidas preventivas e, por conseguinte, nós, no Parlamento Europeu, somos favoráveis à introdução de um mecanismo automático também no ramo preventivo do Pacto.
Contudo, é igualmente urgente - a aqui reside a nossa tarefa enquanto co-legisladores - que a Europa demonstre um grande poder de decisão para conseguir um pacto de estabilidade e uma governação económica ambiciosos.
Contudo, é muito importante que os Estados-Membros da região do Mediterrâneo continuem a cooperar e a coordenar esforços entre si e com países terceiros. É necessário fazer mais.
Contudo, é necessário um financiamento adequado para que as prioridades da União sejam credíveis. O desenvolvimento de infra-estruturas de transportes e de energia, o investimento em investigação e desenvolvimento, a aprendizagem e as políticas relativas aos jovens têm de encontrar um impulso nos futuros orçamentos da União, enquanto os pilares fundamentais da política de coesão e da política agrícola devem continuar a receber o actual nível de financiamento.
Convenção da OIT complementada por uma recomendação sobre os trabalhadores domésticos (debate) 
Convidamos os nossos colegas romenos do Parlamento Europeu e a Comissão, na qualidade de guardiã dos Tratados, a intervir como mediadores para resolver esta questão.
Convido, portanto, o Conselho a tomar uma decisão rápida sobre esta iniciativa.
Convirá observar que este relatório está redigido com base na experiência anterior da UE sobre o funcionamento da União Económica e Monetária, que identifica a necessidade de um quadro de governação económica reforçada, tal como é proposto no presente relatório.
Convém chamar a atenção para o facto de que esta legislação terá um impacto negativo nas receitas dos transportadores rodoviários europeus e dilatará os prazos de entrega.
Convém conceder um elevado grau de prioridade ao desenvolvimento do conceito de documentos de estratégia europeus, e o Parlamento Europeu deve participar activamente nesse processo. O Parlamento deve ter a possibilidade de defender a especificidade da política de desenvolvimento da UE no instrumento de cooperação para o desenvolvimento no período pós-2013, examinando as decisões estratégicas de programação em pé de igualdade com o Conselho.
Convém confrontar com a realidade as bonitas palavras que aqui ouvimos sobre a importância da cultura e da educação. E a realidade iniludível é a de um acentuado desinvestimento nestas áreas, um recuo do Estado que põe em causa a sua função social e tem como resultado o acentuar das desigualdades no acesso à educação, ao conhecimento e à cultura e, consequentemente, a reprodução e aprofundamento das desigualdades sociais.
Convém lembrar que, para atingir o nosso objectivo de um nível de emprego de 75%, como consagrado na estratégia "Europa 2020", é imperioso apoiar as PME.
Convém referir que a causa da catástrofe foi a avaria no sistema de refrigeração devido a uma falha de energia, e as interrupções no fornecimento de energia são um acontecimento frequente nos Estados-Membros. Não pode haver dúvida de que devíamos retirar conclusões desta história, mas não devemos cair em histeria como resposta à catástrofe no Japão. Este acidente levantou sérias dúvidas em relação à segurança da energia nuclear em todo o mundo.
Convém tomar em consideração as prescrições técnicas adoptadas pela Comissão Económica para a Europa das ONU (CEE/NU), nos seus regulamentos anexados ao Acordo da Comissão Económica para a Europa da ONU, respeitante à adopção de disposições técnicas uniformes aplicáveis aos veículos de rodas, aos equipamentos e às peças susceptíveis de serem montados ou utilizados num veículo de rodas e às condições uniformes de reconhecimento recíproco das homologações emitidas em conformidade com essas disposições.
Cooperar com o objectivo de melhorar o ensino e a formação profissionais significa reduzir a taxa de desemprego dos jovens, dotar os trabalhadores de ferramentas cognitivas e criar oportunidades de financiamento mais amplas e simplificadas. A actual conjuntura socioeconómica exige a capacidade de trabalhar em enquadramentos internacionais; devemos, pois, aumentar as oportunidades de aprendizagem, sem esquecer o papel das empresas, que necessitam cada vez mais de pessoal qualificado e com experiência de formação prática, preparado para assumir de imediato e exercer com eficiência as suas funções.
Coordenar e aproveitar sinergias neste sector em crescimento pode ser crucial para o desenvolvimento económico da UE. A indústria cultural e criativa tem um potencial muito grande para se constituir como um dos motores de crescimento da UE.
Correndo o risco de repetir o que alguns oradores já referiram, recordo que a nossa proposta incluirá um capítulo específico sobre a governação a vários níveis, que incluirá a nossa posição e um apelo a todas as partes interessadas para cooperar na elaboração dos programas operacionais nas regiões. Convido, também, aqueles que detêm posições de responsabilidade nas regiões a assegurar a participação das administrações locais. E digo-o porque ouvi, à semelhança de muitos dos senhores deputados, queixas por parte das regiões no sentido de que as autoridades nacionais não incluem o nível regional, quando as administrações locais lamentam o facto de o nível local não ser considerado pelas regiões.
Cortes ainda mais profundos nos serviços de saúde constituem um sério atentado à vida e integridade humanas. A chamada reforma proposta pelo Governo de Emil Boc constitui um ataque directo aos direitos proporcionados pela Carta dos Direitos Fundamentais da UE. Em nome dos cidadãos da Roménia, convido a Comissão Europeia a adoptar uma posição e a bloquear estas medidas desumanas que estão a pôr em perigo vidas e direitos fundamentais.
Costumamos dizer que todos os nossos acordos de comércio livre devem ser ambiciosos, mas este é de facto um acordo ambicioso.
Creio pois que, até certo ponto, eu seria criticado se aceitasse a aplicação de medidas de protecção da indústria farmacêutica na Índia que não fossem aplicadas à nossa própria indústria. É disso que se trata, nada mais.
Creio que União Europeia, tirando proveito da sua experiência interna em matéria de cooperação entre as nações e as instituições, detém uma responsabilidade mundial particular que deve continuar a assumir.
Creio que a ABE está a fazer um bom trabalho sob a liderança de Andrea Enria; o mesmo se aplica às outras autoridades, o Comité do Risco Sistémico e, Senhor Deputado Giegold, a Autoridade Europeia dos Seguros e Pensões Complementares de Reforma (EIOPA). Há pouco, V. Exa. mencionou os testes no sector dos seguros; A EIOPA está neste momento a preparar uma série de testes nesse sector, tal como a ABE fez para as instituições bancárias.
Creio que a União Europeia, cujo território é afectado por aproximadamente metade da precipitação radioactiva da catástrofe - uso a forma do presente "é" deliberadamente -, deve considerar os seus próprios interesses neste caso.
Creio que a União deve desempenhar um papel activo e de liderança na reforma da governança global de modo a tornar as instituições e organizações internacionais e organizações mais legítimas, eficazes e propícias à responsabilidade compartilhada.
Creio que a convergência regulamentar suscitada por certos acordos aéreos internacionais se vai concretizar na criação de condições de concorrência equitativas, o que não só é benéfico para a indústria dos países envolvidos, mas constitui também uma oportunidade para uniformizar e reforçar as normas sociais e ambientais.
Creio que a paz no Oriente Médio é um tema suficientemente sensível, e o trabalho da UNRWA suficientemente importante, para não estar sujeito, ano após ano, ao jogo da Comissão de propor valores mais baixos que depois subirão na negociação sobre o processo orçamental.
Creio que alguns Estados-Membros sabotaram deliberadamente as negociações. Decidiram proteger a indústria agrícola e defender os seus interesses.
Creio que apenas um instrumento opcional, a adoptar por meio de um regulamento, pode adequadamente satisfazer os objectivos da totalidade da reforma do direito europeu dos contratos.
Creio que concordamos nos princípios fundamentais e nos valores básicos, acerca dos quais muito se falou hoje, tendo sido debatidas até mesmo as filosofias de integração, e devo dizer que grande parte das intervenções dos senhores deputados reflectiu o acordo que existe entre nós. Também estamos de acordo quanto à extrema dificuldade dos problemas que o Conselho Europeu tem actualmente pela frente.
Creio que devemos pedir à Comissão dos Assuntos Externos que discuta a situação no Egipto, incluindo tudo o que tem acontecido entre as minorias, que elabore um relatório de iniciativa e que, depois, realize um debate com a Baronesa Ashton um mês mais tarde.
Creio que esta abordagem merecerá uma forte oposição por parte dos Estados-Membros porque aumenta consideravelmente o nível de incerteza jurídica para os investidores que beneficiam destes acordos.
Creio que esta parceria não seria só uma oportunidade, mas também uma necessidade, pois se o que dissemos é verdade, a saber, que a abordagem integrada da Europa constitui o seu principal potencial, a consecução dessa abordagem integrada exigirá o apoio de um organismo dotado claramente de poderes legislativos e orçamentais.
Creio que este Paquistão, na qualidade de nosso aliado, também ajudaria a resolver a situação de impasse que se vive no Afeganistão.
Creio que existe falta de honestidade em relação a esta ajuda para o desenvolvimento pseudo-humanitária.
Creio que importa também atender ao trabalho que efectivamente temos desenvolvido no âmbito da PCSD; não nos confundamos com descrições que não são verdadeiras. Só na Líbia, conseguimos viabilizar, através da nossa ajuda, o regresso a casa de 55 000 pessoas. Não me opus a uma zona de exclusão aérea no Conselho Europeu e o Primeiro-Ministro Cameron poderá confirmar; não foram de modo algum as minhas palavras. O que eu disse foi que para haver eficácia e celeridade, era importante que aqueles que podiam actuar rapidamente o fizessem.
Creio que isto é sobretudo devido aos efeitos negativos das barreiras não tarifárias.
Creio que não temos de tomar em consideração outros critérios que não sejam os estritamente técnicos e jurídicos.
Creio que o Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento deve ser actualizado e a coordenação da política fiscal deve ser melhorada por forma a reforçar a supervisão dos orçamentos nacionais e assegurar que os Estados-Membros tomam decisões "prudentes" nas épocas "boas", de modo a constituirem o necessário amortecimento para as épocas "más". Esta é a única forma de garantir que a evolução da dívida e do défice será acompanhada de perto.
Creio que o exemplo da indústria aeroespacial na Irlanda do Norte é significativo - empresas maiores a orientar e ajudar empresas mais pequenas a terem acesso ao programa - e gostaria de aproveitar esta oportunidade para solicitar à senhora Comissária que nos indique maneiras novas e radicais de as pequenas e médias empresas beneficiarem deste importantíssimo programa.
Creio que o que está em causa neste Conselho Europeu, independentemente das soluções técnicas, independentemente das desavenças políticas, é saber se nós queremos, ou não, que o projecto europeu continue um projecto válido para a estratégia de paz na Europa.
Creio que para nós é essencial fazê-lo. Além disso, este pacote pode ser a prova de como as instituições europeias podem cooperar de uma forma responsável, eficiente e construtiva num tão importante domínio. Várias vezes durante os trílogos escutei sérias críticas por parte dos deputados ao Parlamento Europeu sobre os procedimentos intergovernamentais. A adopção rápida e atempada do pacote seria a prova de que o método comunitário é a abordagem acertada para avançar.
Creio que será também uma boa oportunidade para, com base em algumas ideias novas introduzidas nessa revisão da Política Europeia de Vizinhança, conversar sobre o reforço da cooperação para resolver os conflitos que se vêm eternizando na nossa vizinhança.
Creio que todos chegámos à conclusão de que se trata de uma pessoa muito competente.
Creio que todos os presentes conhecem os esforços que desenvolvemos. A Comissão apoia a votação invertida por maioria qualificada. O mesmo acontece com o Banco Central Europeu e com um conjunto de EstadosMembros, mas não em todos os países nem em todas as regiões. O Conselho já aceitou a votação invertida por maioria qualificada em cinco das seis decisões em que ela era juridicamente possível.
Creio que é importante transmitir todas estas preocupações e exortar a Comissão a manter-se firme nos princípios e políticas europeus.
Creio que é satisfatório o equilíbrio conseguido pela Comissão e pelo Conselho neste relatório, razão pela qual lhe dei o meu apoio, tal como dou à totalidade do pacote relativo à governação económica.
Creio que é uma atitude desequilibrada. É, efectivamente, ridículo, e não ajuda a pressionar o regime de Assad a mudar de direcção. Não é suficiente afirmar que 13 pessoas e um irmão de Assad figuram aí, e que uma das sobrinhas ou sobrinhos está na lista. Não, há centenas de pessoas que é preciso que figurem na lista imediatamente, o mais rapidamente possível, para exercer uma verdadeira pressão.
Creio que, aos olhos dos eleitores e aos meus, os dois assuntos estão interligados. Não votarei seguramente a favor de qualquer acordo, a não ser que esta disputa esteja resolvida antes de se chegar à fase final desta negociação.
Creio que, regra geral, todos partilhamos a opinião de que umas finanças públicas equilibradas e sólidas são condição necessária para um crescimento sustentável e para o reforço da criação de emprego, ambos eles objectivos consignados no actual pacote legislativo.
Creio ser essencial a aprovação do projecto de acordo sobre a criação de um registo da transparência. O registo comum constituirá um passo em frente para maior transparência nas instituições europeias, esperando-se que venha a contribuir para conferir uma maior legitimidade ao projecto europeu aos olhos dos cidadãos.
Creio ser essencial, por conseguinte, que a União Europeia faça tudo quanto estiver ao seu alcance para ajudar os Sudaneses a ultrapassar este período crítico e a evitar uma catástrofe humanitária, porque este país só pode principiar a trabalhar sistematicamente para alcançar os seus objectivos em matéria de desenvolvimento, se prevalecer a confiança num futuro pacífico.
Creio ser necessária coerência entre as políticas viradas para o crescimento e o emprego sustentável, com especial incidência no desenvolvimento e reforço do mercado único, no fomento do comércio internacional e da competitividade e um quadro eficaz de prevenção e de correcção de situações orçamentais excessivas. É, além disso, de enorme importância que tenha lugar esta consolidação da governação económica, potenciando ao mesmo tempo as suas credenciais democráticas.
Creio ser necessária uma maior discussão sobre o quadro estratégico da política externa da União e um maior conhecimento do âmbito da PESC e dos mecanismos para a sua condução, à disposição dos diversos actores políticos. O elevado número de alterações apresentadas denota o crescente interesse dos deputados por estas questões.
Creio ser necessário, como salientou a senhora deputada Ţicău, reservar fundos adicionais para o programa Galileo e, possivelmente, criar no orçamento da UE um fundo de reserva para o Galileo que cubra eventuais despesas adicionais, sem prejudicar, no entanto, os outros programas.
Creio também que a adesão da Rússia à OMC irá incentivar os investimentos e melhorar as relações comerciais com a UE. Apoiar a Rússia nos seus esforços por se tornar membro da OMC redunda em nosso benefício.
Creio também que não devemos esquecer as obrigações de transparência, que, em última análise se devem aplicar também ao Conselho.
Creio tratar-se de um ponto fundamental, que será recordado ao longo dos tempos; por outras palavras, graças a este programa, podemos desenvolver o imenso potencial da exploração económica deste domínio pelo sector das telecomunicações, pelo sector audiovisual e por novos serviços, e, simultaneamente, lançar o desenvolvimento económico e outros sectores ligados às telecomunicações. Podemos também desenvolver o potencial cultural e social que este duplo objectivo permite e exige.
Creio, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, que ao incluir a Roménia a Bulgária no espaço Schengen, que conta com mais de quatrocentos milhões de seres humanos, nós estamos a adicionar, não a subtrair; estamos a construir uma Europa mais forte.
Creio, de facto, que as limitadas medidas de política comercial aplicadas pela União Europeia ao sector dos têxteis são plenamente geríveis sem impor o excessivo encargo de apresentar provas de origem para todas as importações. Além disso, as autorizações de importação, os sistemas de vigilância estatística ex post e as exigências de documentos administrativos únicos já garantem um controlo eficaz das importações na União. Para completar o quadro, porém, aguardo com expectativa a plena entrada em vigor do relatório Muscardini, que irá permitir aos consumidores europeus estarem mais bem informados sobre a origem dos produtos, incluindo os têxteis provenientes de países terceiros.
Creio, por conseguinte, Senhor Deputado Reul, que, uma vez que não temos suficiente experiência com os efeitos das radiações a longo prazo, são necessários estudos de investigação. Queria encorajar a Comissão a pôr em marcha esses estudos.
Creio, por conseguinte, que é muito importante que a resolução final inclua um apelo claro a uma investigação completa e eficaz sobre a cumplicidade dos Estados-Membros da União Europeia e respectivos programas de entregas e detenções secretas.
Creio, portanto, que a criação de um registo comum ao Parlamento e à Comissão, que permita reunir todas as informações relativas às organizações e indivíduos que mantêm contacto com as Instituições não só simplifica os procedimentos burocráticos, prevendo um único registo, como constituirá igualmente uma clara melhoria no sentido de um diálogo cada vez mais aberto e transparente com os representantes de interesses.
Cremos que a indissociação do planeamento dos Fundos Estruturais e do Fundo de Coesão e uma melhor reintegração destes com o Fundo de Desenvolvimento Rural e o Fundo Europeu das Pescas são formas de estimular o potencial das regiões mais atrasadas.
Cria também excelentes oportunidades para os imigrantes ilegais, que sabem que, independentemente do local por onde entrarem na Europa, poderão fixar-se onde quiserem: a França é particularmente atingida.
Criar alternativas eficazes é a melhor maneira de combater a pirataria. É também imprescindível que a Comissão apresente uma proposta ambiciosa sobre direitos de autor - algo que aguardamos com grande expectativa.
Criar precisamente agora - à laia de notícia, digamos assim - o problema de adicionar mais alguns cêntimos - quatro cêntimos não serão nada para a senhora deputada Durant -, quando acabámos de passar, ou estamos ainda em plena crise do pepino, devido precisamente a acusações irresponsáveis e falsas, sem provas, que deram um duro golpe em milhares de famílias espanholas, não apenas agricultores, mas também transportadores, não é o mais indicado! Porque precisamente esses poucos cêntimos, em milhares de quilómetros e em produtos como o pepino espanhol, geram um problema grave em termos de transporte para o mercado central, justamente donde provêm essas acusações.
Criar-lhes condições para seguir o caminho educativo mais adequado, aprender mais facilmente línguas estrangeiras, abordar o mundo do trabalho dotados das competências certas ou porventura entrar num novo ambiente profissional significa construir um futuro para todos os países da União Europeia através das energias dos estudantes universitários e dos jovens trabalhadores, que se juntam na mesma mescla económica e cultural.
Criou-se uma situação muito difícil no Conselho, porque alguns Estados-Membros não produzem qualquer balanço ambiental.
Crise no sector das pescas europeu devido ao aumento do preço do petróleo (votação) 
Critérios como o emprego serão, por isso, tidos em consideração quando definirmos os limites máximos para a ajuda ao rendimento agrícola.
Criámos agora uma camada adicional, mas poderá, Senhor Comissário, dizer-nos se vamos ter um regulador independente adicional, cuja avaliação seja complementada por uma segunda opinião científica?
Criámos um sistema que fará com que seja possível assegurar que qualquer pedido esteja de acordo com os desejos do consumidor (principais características do produto ou serviço, custo total, duração do contrato) antes da sua validação definitiva.
Cumpre encorajar a investigação no domínio das alterações climáticas, sobretudo como parte de projectos multinacionais.
Cumpre que agora a UE adopte as medidas correctas ao responder às catástrofes de Chernobyl e de Fukushima. O receio de que os testes de resistência prometidos para todas as centrais nucleares proporcionassem simplesmente uma desculpa para o funcionamento continuado dos reactores demonstrou, infelizmente, ser bem fundamentados, à luz dos critérios de resistência anunciados.
Cumpre-me reiterar que as barreiras não tarifárias e os contratos públicos são domínios cruciais para as empresas europeias em que o Japão deverá fazer concessões significativas.
Cumpre-nos envidar todos os esforços para impedir que isto aconteça. A Comissão fez muitos discursos inflamados apelando a um verdadeiro apoio às pequenas e médias empresas e à redução da burocracia.
Cumpre-nos exercer mais pressão sobre as autoridades egípcias para defender os cristãos coptas. É essencial reforçar a secção para a prevenção da intolerância religiosa da Subcomissão "Assuntos Políticos" do Serviço Europeu de Acção Externa, dando especial atenção aos cristãos perseguidos.
Cumpre-nos garantir que o andamento das negociações não abrande. O contrário é que representa para mim a maior ameaça, por outras palavras, deixar que os conflitos relativos a várias questões colaterais passem a ser a questão dominante e nos façam perder de vista o principal. O que interessa mesmo é alargar o comércio livre.
Cumpre-nos melhorá-los mediante o reforço dos nossos programas de mobilidade porque, através da mobilidade, as crianças, os estudantes, os trabalhadores e os voluntários adquirem as competências transversais que não podem ser adquiridas por meio da educação formal.
Cumpre-nos, neste Parlamento, fazer tudo quanto estiver ao nosso alcance para que o Ano Internacional da Química seja um êxito, porque, como disse Marie Curie, "Agora é tempo de compreendermos mais, para temermos menos". A celebração deste ano é uma boa ocasião para termos isso em consideração.
Cumprindo a prática instituída, a Comissão dos Assuntos Externos elaborou uma proposta de recomendação do Parlamento ao Conselho referente à sessão da Assembleia Geral das Nações Unidas.
Cumprirá submeter as centrais nucleares a testes de esforço, sendo, a este respeito, lamentável que não tenha sido aprovada a alteração que exige o encerramento imediato dos reactores do tipo de Chernobyl que continuam em funcionamento.
Da forma como vejo esta questão, o que é importante é saber o que é que os eurodeputados podem fazer. Só lhes é permitido trabalhar profissionalmente aqui no Parlamento, ou também lhes é permitido desenvolverem outras actividades para além do trabalho no Parlamento? Pessoalmente, creio que essas outras actividades deveriam ser definidas muito claramente e deveriam ser limitadas ao trabalho científico e às publicações. Quaisquer outras actividades noutras áreas levantarão sempre questões e dúvidas.
Da fronteira lituana vai ser possível avistar as chaminés de uma destas centrais nucleares com a mesma nitidez como podemos ver a torre da Catedral de Estrasburgo a partir do Parlamento.
Da mesma forma lhe peço encarecidamente que pare de usar ou aproveitar cada crise como uma oportunidade para perseguir os intuitos supranacionalistas que têm por objectivo uma união orçamental ou uma união fiscal, porque não nos levará a lado nenhum.
Da mesma forma que a Comissão impôs alterações às leis sobre os meios de comunicação na Hungria porque alguns pontos eram inaceitáveis, a Comissão ou o Tribunal de Justiça da União Europeia tomarão medidas se em aplicação da Constituição forem aprovadas leis que violem o direito comunitário. É inclusivamente possível recorrer ao Tribunal de Justiça da União Europeia.
Da mesma forma que a política energética e de geração de energia é uma matéria para os Estados-Membros na Europa, temos de concordar que devem ser os canadianos e a democracia canadiana a decidirem a forma como a energia é produzida no país e que impacto ambiental deve, afinal, ser tomado em consideração. Temos de nos esforçar por garantir a criação de um programa de investigação neste domínio para ajudar à utilização desses recursos de uma forma tão amiga do ambiente e sustentável quanto possível.
Da mesma forma, as entidades macro-regionais não são a resposta adequada para aumentar a eficácia das despesas a nível regional. A sua validade é altamente questionável e mina o papel dos Estados-Membros, que, a meu ver, devem continuar a ser o principal veículo para gerir as despesas da política de coesão. Elas não nos vão ajudar a cumprir a nossa visão de uma política de coesão mais limitada e melhor direccionada, que ajude realmente as regiões mais desfavorecidas da Europa.
Da mesma forma, consideramos que devem ser reunidos dados que promovam uma melhor compreensão do problema.
Da mesma forma, insisto que o meu país, a República Checa, também tem o direito de determinar por si só a forma como pretende produzir electricidade.
Da mesma maneira, considero que as tentativas de introduzir um imposto sobre o carbono como uma alternativa ao imposto sobre as transacções financeiras são excepcionalmente gravosas.
Da recente crise podemos tirar duas importantes ilações: a necessidade de finanças públicas sustentáveis e a urgência de trabalhar no sentido de uma maior coordenação de políticas económicas entre os Estados-Membros, com um acento tónico na prevenção. E é exactamente sobre estes dois pontos que este relatório versa.
Dada a amplitude das ameaças e a área total de florestas da UE, o financiamento deve aumentar, a elegibilidade deve ser alargada a agentes públicos e grupos de produtores, passando para uma remuneração de base territorial e incluindo medidas de conservação.
Dada a conjuntura de austeridade orçamental que atravessamos - e que é consequência directa da crise global que afectou gravemente o mercado de trabalho europeu -, temos de ponderar as nossas estratégias de crescimento e emprego, em particular as dirigidas aos jovens, sem perder de vista as especificidades e necessidades de cada país.
Dada a crise económica que se mantém e o aumento dos encargos financeiros para os operadores de transporte, também defendo sem sombra de dúvida que os Estados-Membros devem gozar da opção de fasear a introdução das taxas aplicáveis aos custos externos ao longo do tempo e de acordo com tipos específicos. O novo sistema também deverá possibilitar a substituição de frotas obsoletas através da utilização de taxas reduzidas para os custos externos no caso de investimento em veículos amigos do ambiente.
Dada a importância das indústrias baseadas no conhecimento e do bom desenvolvimento do nosso sector de I&D, não podemos dar-nos ao luxo de esperar até PQ8 para agirmos. A "Estratégia de Lisboa”, que estabeleceu para a UE o objectivo de se tornar, em 2010, a economia do conhecimento mais competitiva e mais dinâmica do mundo pode ter fracassado, mas isso não quer dizer que devemos abandoná-la por completo.
Dada a multiplicidade de erros cometidos pela UE, é duvidoso que as tecnologias de informação e comunicação sejam suficientes para criar uma identidade europeia.
Dadas as consequências que as notações de risco da dívida soberana podem ter no mercado, nos balanços orçamentais e no bem-estar da população em geral, é imperativo que estas se baseiem em factos e dados fidedignos.
Dadas as posições dos protagonistas deste processo, todos nós teremos de dar mostras de algum nível de flexibilidade. A Comissão está pronta para desempenhar o seu papel, para ser flexível e para facilitar um acordo entre o Parlamento e o Conselho, mas não a qualquer preço. Estaremos vigilantes em relação aos princípios básicos da nossa proposta. A existência dos acordos bilaterais de investimento necessita de ser salvaguardada mas não poderemos ao mesmo tempo dar incondicionalmente a nossa bênção a acordos que dêem origem a problemas significativos.
Dado o contexto ainda economicamente frágil decorrente da crise financeira que assolou a Europa, na sua revisão intercalar, o relator refere aspectos importantes que devem ser melhorados a fim de utilizar da forma mais eficaz possível os fundos públicos disponíveis.
Dado o progresso das negociações, é, pois, oportuno obter da Comissão Europeia informação pública sobre um conjunto dos pontos mais relevantes dessa negociação.
Dado que a Internet é um local de encontro a nível global, a UE deve desenvolver políticas específicas de promoção da cultura europeia. O sítio Web "Europeana” é um passo nesse sentido; infelizmente, porém, continua subaproveitado. A contribuição da cultura para as economias dos países europeus também não deve ser ignorada.
Dado que a clonagem é uma matéria demasiado complexa para ser relegada para uns poucos parágrafos numa outra proposta, exorto a Comissão, mais uma vez, a preparar um relatório e a apresentar uma proposta legislativa separada que regule todos os aspectos da clonagem, com base na segurança alimentar e em todos os dados científicos disponíveis.
Dado que a directiva actual relativa às práticas enganosas se revelou insuficiente, votei a favor da presente resolução que exorta a Comissão Europeia a acelerar a revisão da presente directiva para acabar o mais depressa possível com as referidas práticas enganosas.
Dado que ainda está por resolver a questão mais importante - a integração do que é designado como a nova categoria intermédia das regiões -, gostaria, a este respeito, de solicitar ao Senhor Comissário e à Comissão Europeia, no seu conjunto, que nos facultassem, o mais brevemente possível, todos os aspectos que ainda estão por esclarecer relativamente à criação desta categoria de regiões, em especial os aspectos financeiros e as suas consequências, uma vez que esta questão diz respeito ao desenvolvimento futuro das regiões de toda a União Europeia.
Dado que as mulheres representam apenas 30% dos investigadores europeus e 13% dos directores de instituições europeias de investigação, gostaria de sublinhar a necessidade de a Iniciativa "União da Inovação" contemplar orientações futuras em matéria de uma representação mais equilibrada de mulheres e homens em disciplinas científicas.
Dado que estas medidas constituem um passo em frente, votei a favor do relatório.
Dado que no mercado há ainda uma grande quantidade de créditos de compensação, com 25% a nível doméstico, apontamos igualmente para um objectivo global de 30%. Isso limita também um tanto ou quanto o papel do mecanismo de compensação, que foi igualmente objecto de debate; isso consta também do relatório.
Dado que o Parlamento está agora em pé de igualdade com o Conselho no que respeita à reformulação deste regulamento, existe uma oportunidade real e única para reforçar a responsabilidade dos Estados-Membros, e não devemos perdê-la.
Dado que o Parlamento é a única Instituição europeia democraticamente eleita e que representa directamente os cidadãos e os contribuintes europeus, acredito que temos o direito de saber exactamente de que forma são geridas todas as dotações. Não é possível que o Conselho mantenha a sua linha de actuação, rejeitando a necessária e devida confrontação interinstitucional.
Dado que o Tratado de Lisboa carece de disposições clarificadoras do estatuto dos acordos bilaterais, necessitamos de garantir segurança jurídica aos investidores que beneficiam destes acordos autorizando a sua existência continuada.
Dado que o comportamento irresponsável das agências de notação de crédito tem sido frequentemente o detonador da especulação que lesa essencialmente os contribuintes europeus, é extremamente importante, no âmbito do processo de reforma que será concluído no Outono, rever o papel daquelas agências na avaliação da dívida soberana.
Dado que o sector agrícola tem uma importância fundamental, exortamos a Comissão a negociar um acordo que seja benéfico tanto para produtores como para consumidores e que garanta uma concorrência justa entre os produtores agrícolas da União Europeia e do Canadá. Por fim, consideramos que o Conselho deve obter a aprovação do Parlamento no tocante a todo e qualquer acordo internacional de comércio e que o Parlamento tem de ser imediata e plenamente informado, em todas as fases do processo, a fim de acautelar um maior controlo democrático. Só assim poderemos conseguir um grau de crescimento mais elevado em matéria de comércio e investimento entre a União Europeia e o Canadá.
Dado que os contratos públicos representam 17% do PIB da União Europeia, pensamos que as PME precisam de aumentar a sua participação no mercado dos contratos públicos. É por isso que solicitamos à Comissão e aos Estados-Membros que tomem as medidas necessárias até 2015 para garantir que pelo menos 50% das transacções de contratos públicos se realizem por via electrónica, em consonância com o compromisso assumido pelos governos dos Estados-Membros em Manchester, em 2005.
Dado que os grupos de pressão, independentemente de representarem interesses privados ou públicos, desempenham um papel inegável nas questões europeias, deverá existir maior transparência relativamente às relações que mantêm com a nossa Instituição. Na minha opinião, deveria ser obrigatório que fossem inscritos no Registo de Transparência.
Dado que pode revelar-se demasiado difícil, do ponto de vista político, aplicar um método comunitário tanto para as avaliações como para a suspensão, por mais recomendável que fosse, não seria preferível atribuir prioridade à substância europeia, desencadeando, sempre que necessário, um processo de infracção contra os Estados-Membros que violem as regras de Schengen?
Dado que, até hoje, nem a União Europeia nem a União Africana conseguiram alcançar um compromisso com o Governo malgaxe, foram adoptadas algumas medidas, incluindo a suspensão da ajuda do Fundo Monetário Internacional e do Banco Mundial, bem como o não reconhecimento, pela nossa parte, do governo de transição. Condenamos o golpe de Estado e sublinhamos a necessidade premente de eleições livres e transparentes, acompanhadas pela comunidade internacional.
Dado que, no Reino Unido em geral, os empregos no sector público estão a tornar-se mais incertos e, segundo espero, a maioria dos meus eleitores vais criar ou trabalhar em pequenas empresas, estou absolutamente de acordo e subscrevo as ambiciosas metas para reduzir os encargos administrativos das PME e objectivos como o "teste PME" para toda a legislação. Aliadas à política de regulação de "one in, one out" que o meu próprio governo está a aplicar, estas medidas ajudam a alcançar o nosso objectivo.
Dados fornecidos pelo Eurobarómetro e recolhidos pela Coldiretti, em Itália, mostram que 43% dos italianos, por exemplo, evitam os alimentos de que ouvem falar durante um certo período de tempo, enquanto 13% os excluem definitivamente da sua alimentação. Devemos, pois, procurar reflectir sobre o que afirmamos e sobre a forma como influenciamos os hábitos alimentares das pessoas.
Dados os benefícios dos acordos mencionados, creio ser conveniente estabelecer princípios gerais sobre o modo como os acordos sobre transportes aéreos devem ser avaliados.
Damos o nosso apoio ao reforço do cumprimento, pelos Estados-Membros, das vertentes do Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento, bem como ao incentivo de haver uma maior coordenação das suas políticas fiscais. O regulamento hoje adoptado foi alterado por forma a assegurar que os Estados-Membros seguem políticas fiscais prudentes nas épocas "boas", de modo a constituírem o amortecimento protector das épocas mais difíceis. O quadro da UE para a supervisão orçamental, bem como para a coordenação das políticas económicas, deverá ser alargado de modo a incluir a dimensão do emprego e a dimensão social.
Daqui deve resultar uma lista de recomendações ou normas para um envolvimento local mais formalizado na futura concepção e implementação de políticas.
Dar-lhe-emos uma resposta por escrito sobre esta questão. Considero que quando é construída uma infra-estrutura de transportes, deveremos incluir não apenas a área de terreno por baixo do cabo, por outras palavras, não apenas a rota seguida pelo teleférico, a qual tem um metro de largura e vários milhares de metros de comprimento.
Darei também o meu voto favorável à alteração 5, que visa a adopção de critérios claros e rigorosos, que consideramos de suma importância para evitar dificuldades na aplicação do novo quadro.
Dará também início a um processo de inspecções e investigações conjuntas e troca de dados de segurança. A aceitação mútua das conclusões de certificação vai permitir que se consigam realizar poupanças significativas no funcionamento das companhias de aviação europeias e canadianas. O Acordo, por um lado, vai aumentar a competitividade dos mercados de aviação e, por outro lado - ao aproximar entidades reguladoras - vai também melhorar a segurança dos mesmos.
Daí a importância de, nas negociações sobre o acordo de comércio livre, a Comissão Europeia pugnar pela introdução de cláusulas juridicamente vinculativas nestes domínios. A Índia pode ser um exemplo para os restantes países em desenvolvimento, e isto não apenas do ponto de vista económico mas também no plano da democracia.
Daí a importância desta resolução que insiste na necessidade de a União Europeia adoptar outros indicadores complementares do PIB, a fim de ter melhor em conta, entre outros aspectos, as alterações climáticas, a biodiversidade ou mesmo a integração social, sendo estes grandes desafios políticos que me são caros.
Daí a minha pergunta ao Senhor Comissário: quais são as principais mudanças que têm de ser feitas para assegurar que este ano não se repita o falhanço do teste de esforço do ano passado?
Daí a necessidade de a UE cooperar com as grandes potências regionais a fim de participar activamente na instauração e na melhoria de um ambiente internacional que permita à UE promover os seus valores e interesses. O momento é particularmente apropriado, dado o aumento acentuado de crises políticas e humanitárias no mundo que requerem que a União Europeia aproveite a oportunidade e faça melhor uso dos seus instrumentos de política externa, a fim de assegurar uma melhor utilização da sua alavancagem em organizações multilaterais e assumir a liderança na abordagem mais eficaz às crises internacionais actuais e futuras.
Daí a necessidade de avaliações de impacto a longo prazo em relação aos capítulos e aspectos mais relevantes de qualquer cooperação em matéria de política económica e comercial futuramente acordada entre os 27 Estados-Membros da UE e o Japão. Por esta razão, tanto o Parlamento Europeu, como autoridade co-decisora, como o público em geral devem também ser consultados.
Daí a necessidade de rever a legislação em vigor de modo a facilitar o acesso ao financiamento, diminuir os custos administrativos e toda a burocracia, incentivar a poupança energética (actualmente, apenas 24 % das empresas valorizam esta questão), melhorar a tecnologia empresarial através da eco-inovação, fomentar a melhoria do nível de qualificações, educação e formação profissional, e promover a internacionalização e a boa governação. Congratulo-me, pois, com a aprovação desta resolução. Espero que todas as PME beneficiem destas medidas e se tornem prósperas, pois todos os cidadãos europeus serão beneficiados.
Daí achar que isso constituirá um erro enorme.
Daí eu estar a trabalhar em estreita cooperação com o meu colega, Senhor Comissário Cioloş, na tentativa de dar resposta às dificuldades com que se depara este grupo de cidadãos, igualmente atingido pelo surto.
Daí o conjunto de propostas que apresentámos, com destaque para a defesa clara e inequívoca do sistema de quotas de produção, ajustadas a cada Estado-Membro em função das suas necessidades alimentares, assegurando a protecção de agricultores de países como Portugal.
Daí o papel fundamental da formação contínua na readaptação sistemática das qualificações profissionais às exigências da economia.
Daí que a participação da Croácia nos trabalhos do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência seja bem-vinda. É, no entanto, necessário que a Croácia intensifique o combate ao tráfico de droga no seu país, pois este continua a ser uma das principais rotas de tráfico da Europa.
Daí que a união da inovação seja uma das bandeiras da estratégia Europa 2020. É um caminho que manifestamente se deve seguir para a afirmação da Europa no contexto internacional e para satisfazer as necessidades dos seus cidadãos. São estes os motivos que estão na base do meu voto favorável.
Daí que garantir a independência dos estudos de impacto seja importante, mas, na prática, algo francamente difícil, dada a multiplicidade de variáveis e de interesses envolvidos. A transparência, a abertura, a consulta, a participação e o escrutínio públicos dos estudos e dos seus resultados revestem-se de uma importância decisiva para assegurar, tanto quanto possível, essa independência e a qualidade do estudo.
Daí que saudemos os esforços que estão a ser realizados por ambas as Instituições - a nossa, bem representada pelo seu Secretário-Geral Klaus Welle - para que possamos dotar-nos de um procedimento próprio do século XXI, de Instituições que devem ser transparentes e responder às expectativas dos cidadãos europeus.
Daí que um quadro estratégico único para os vários Fundos, com uma abordagem integrada e centrada nos resultados, seja o ponto de partida para mais e melhores sinergias entre os vários instrumentos e para o reforço da sua eficácia. É também essencial para uma melhor coordenação entre as várias políticas sectoriais e para uma melhor eficiência na aplicação dos recursos.
Daí ser tão importante que haja um acordo entre a Comissão e cada Estado-Membro no que se refere ao âmbito das previsões e aos métodos de previsão. Uma cooperação desta natureza permitiria evitar cenários macro-orçamentais contraditórios e aumentar a credibilidade da utilização de previsões para efeitos de programação.
Daí ser urgente que a Comissão Europeia dê passos em frente e, como propõe o meu grupo político, eleve o tecto das ajudas de minimis, de 30 000 euros para 60 000 euros por empresa, por um período de três anos. É uma proposta sensata que, na actual situação, garantiria ajuda a um sector a debater-se com dificuldades financeiras, ao mesmo tempo que asseguraria desenvolvimento social e económico.
De 2008 a 2009, foram feitas correcções da ordem dos GBP 12 milhões nos programas do País de Gales e, no mesmo período, a Comissão recuperou em multas um total de 35% dos fundos.
De acordo com a Comissão, a candidatura cumpre os requisitos de elegibilidade para beneficiar do Fundo e aquela instituição recomenda que a autoridade orçamental aprove a sua mobilização. Cumprirá apurar cabal e rapidamente a sua mobilização de modo a não fazer esperar os trabalhadores que devem efectivamente beneficiar do fundo.
De acordo com a OCDE, é essencial que haja coordenação intergovernamental na UE com as suas 27 políticas nacionais de inovação e uma pletora de programas da UE (por exemplo, o Plano de Relançamento da Economia Europeia, o plano SET, o NER 300, a Europe INNOVA, o Fundo de Coesão).
De acordo com a organização não-governamental indiana "Save the Children", calcula-se em 60 milhões o número de crianças que ainda hoje trabalham nos campos, em restaurantes e em fábricas na Índia.
De acordo com as directrizes da UE sobre a pena de morte, estamos a exercer uma forte pressão sobre os Estados Unidos para abolirem a pena de morte, a nível nacional e a nível dos Estados federais, e estamos a pedir um perdão para casos individuais.
De acordo com as estatísticas oficiais do Governo lituano, cerca de 18% dos habitantes das áreas urbanas da Lituânia estão em risco de pobreza. A Lituânia tem uma das taxas de suicídio urbano mais altas do mundo.
De acordo com as estimativas sobre a empregabilidade e os diplomas exigidos, existem, na UE, 15,6 milhões de novos empregos para licenciados e 3,7 milhões para os que possuem o ensino secundário (fonte: Cedefop). Em contrapartida, serão suprimidos 12 milhões de empregos de trabalhadores com níveis de qualificação inferiores!
De acordo com as previsões, os problemas económicos não impedirão que os níveis de qualificação dos empregos continuem a subir na UE, e não devem levar a que os principais programas europeus no domínio do ensino e da formação profissionais, nomeadamente o Programa de Aprendizagem ao Longo da Vida, vejam reduzido o seu financiamento.
De acordo com as últimas investigações, os residentes de pelo menos dois distritos da Ucrânia ainda estão a comer alimentos contaminados.
De acordo com dados estatísticos da União Europeia publicados no mês passado, a Lituânia continua a tentar recuperar o atraso: 51,5% dos pagamentos da PAC vão para o desenvolvimento rural, enquanto na UE27 o valor correspondente é de 23,3%. Temos de continuar a apoiar os esforços feitos pelos nossos agricultores na modernização das suas explorações agrícolas.
De acordo com números recentes, 14,4% dos jovens europeus com idade entre os 18 e os 24 anos abandonaram o ensino antes de concluírem o nível secundário, e menos de um terço da população da União Europeia tem um diploma do ensino superior, em comparação com os 40% dos Estados Unidos e os 50% do Japão. É essencial que os jovens possam desenvolver competências e aptidões que lhes permitam entrar no mercado de trabalho e dar um contributo activo para o crescimento da União.
De acordo com o Acto de Adesão, a verificação, com base nos procedimentos de avaliação, do cumprimento das condições necessárias à aplicação de todas as partes do acervo em causa (protecção de dados, Sistema de Informação Schengen, fronteiras aéreas, fronteiras terrestres, fronteiras marítimas, cooperação policial e vistos) pelos novos Estados-Membros constitui uma condição prévia da adopção de decisões do Conselho relativas à abolição dos controlos nas fronteiras internas com esses Estados-Membros. Não apoiei este documento porque, tendo em conta os resultados das avaliações e das necessárias visitas de acompanhamento efectuadas pelas equipas de peritos, a comissão responsável concluiu ainda existem algumas questões pendentes que exigem relatórios regulares e um acompanhamento no futuro.
De acordo com o Cedefop, prevê-se a eliminação de 12 milhões de postos de trabalho ocupados por mão-de-obra pouco qualificada ou não qualificada, o que prenuncia um risco crescente de pobreza para os mais vulneráveis. São muitos os que, mesmo tendo completado o ensino, não conseguem entrar no mercado de trabalho e se prestam, por isso, a aceitar empregos ocasionais ou trabalhos clandestinos.
De acordo com o Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência (OEDT), não foi realizado na Croácia nenhum inquérito à população sobre o uso de drogas ilícitas.
De acordo com o princípio da partilha de competências ou da gestão partilhada, é aos Estados-Membros e/ou às regiões que compete a aplicação dos programas no terreno.
De acordo com o relatado, a avaliação do cumprimento das condições necessárias à aplicação do acervo em causa (protecção de dados, SIS, fronteiras aéreas, fronteiras terrestres, fronteiras marítimas, cooperação policial e vistos) foi efectuada no terreno, tendo sido constatado in situ os progressos na implementação das medidas que visam a abolição dos controlos nas fronteiras internas com esses Estados-Membros.
De acordo com o relator e os relatores-sombra que acompanharam este processo, as questões ainda pendentes, que exigirão relatórios regulares e um acompanhamento no futuro, não constituem um entrave à plena adesão destes dois Estados-Membros ao espaço Schengen.
De acordo com o relator, senhor deputado Coelho, todas as limitações identificadas no passado foram rectificadas com sucesso pelas autoridades romenas. A Roménia é capaz de proporcionar melhor protecção nas suas fronteiras aéreas, marítimas ou terrestres. É por isso que considero lamentável que ainda existam dúvidas sobre a nossa preparação para aplicar o acervo e que alguns Estados-Membros continuem a proteger a sua chamada "segurança nacional” colocando obstáculos injustificados no caminho de um Estado-Membro que adquiriu o direito a ser tratado de uma forma justa e não discriminatória. O Parlamento Europeu falou hoje a uma só voz sobre a equidade.
De acordo com o relatório, tudo deve permanecer como está: foram pedidos mais recursos para o Fundo Europeu Agrícola de Desenvolvimento Rural, não foram propostas reformas dos fundos estruturais, não existem propostas concretas para aumentar a eficiência.
De acordo com um princípio de transparência acrescida, a divulgação dos resultados, em Junho, será melhorada e acompanhada de uma publicação separada, mais pormenorizada, dos balanços bancários.
De assinalar que a Índia possui um quadro legislativo claro, nomeadamente no que respeita ao procedimento para o registo de indicações geográficas e para a coexistência destas com marcas comerciais.
De cada vez que eu predisse que um país necessitaria de uma operação de resgate, o senhor veio a terreiro ripostar, afirmando que não, não necessitava nada, estava tudo bem. E agora eis-nos perante o quarto resgate - a segunda operação a favor da Grécia - a menos, claro, que o senhor nos vá dizer hoje que também não é necessário.
De cada vez que se alarga o espaço Schengen estamos a expandir o espaço de liberdade, segurança e justiça e estou confiante de que, tal como no passado, o tempo nos trará oportunidades de desenvolvimento económico e outras. É inaceitável que, actualmente, alguns Estados-Membros da União Europeia apelem ao restabelecimento de fronteiras internas. A mobilidade dos cidadãos europeus dentro da União, a liberdade de circulação, é um dos principais fundamentos da Europa, e qualquer restrição iria enfraquecer um dos benefícios mais tangíveis que os nossos cidadãos ganharam com a recente integração Europeia.
De entre as várias hipóteses, o Parlamento Europeu manifesta-se favorável à criação de um instrumento facultativo, sob a forma de regulamento, que regule, em primeiro lugar, as transacções transfronteiriças e que, eventualmente, também esteja apto para a regulação, embora facultativamente, dos contratos internos.
De entre esses, os acordos aéreos internacionais revestem-se de particular importância, considerando as múltiplas necessidades de segurança e de coordenação que envolvem. A avaliação da sua bondade requer critérios rigorosos de escrutínio e um acompanhamento dos termos da negociação. Espero que a Comissão e o Parlamento cooperem activamente de modo a melhorar continuamente a qualidade e rigor deste tipo de acordos.
De especial importância para os consumidores é também o estabelecimento do direito de resolução de um contrato no prazo de 14 dias sem fornecer uma razão e o direito relacionado de obter o reembolso de todos os pagamentos efectuados.
De facto, a Croácia, à semelhança de alguns outros países europeus, é uma rota de trânsito de drogas ilícitas, que são contrabandeadas no caminho dos países de produção para os países consumidores.
De facto, a existência de fardos administrativos desnecessários, como era o caso das provas de origem de certos produtos têxteis, nos casos em que não existem restrições quantitativas à importação desses produtos para o espaço europeu ou nos casos em que existe a necessidade de apresentação de uma autorização de importação, apenas adiciona areia à engrenagem da fluidez pretendida para o comércio internacional.
De facto, a existência de um comércio aberto e justo constitui um poderoso instrumento para gerar mais crescimento e bem-estar social, tirando partido das vantagens comparativas de cada economia e das sinergias potenciais de uma maior integração económica e de novos contributos para uma economia do conhecimento.
De facto, a falta de financiamento europeu para as pequenas e médias empresas participarem neste projecto de investigação, ao abrigo dos Sétimo e Oitavo Programas-Quadro, torná-lo-ia menos atraente para os operadores comerciais.
De facto, a globalização serve apenas para colocar os trabalhadores dos diferentes países uns contra os outros, em concorrência desleal, seja através das deslocalizações, da imigração de candidatos a emprego ou do abominável modo 4 do Acordo Geral sobre o Comércio de Serviços. O problema é que a União Europeia diz muitas palavras bonitas sobre o assunto, mas nunca as põe em prática.
De facto, acredito que o primeiro passo a dar na prevenção de futuras crises económicas é analisar com rigor os factores de risco que podem conduzir a desequilíbrios orçamentais, e o relatório aborda devidamente esta questão. Além do mais, estes critérios são comuns e quantificáveis, pelo que podem ser avaliados e comparados uniformemente em toda a Europa.
De facto, ao ler esta resolução, penso nos meus eleitores que há seis anos, em Londres, foram assassinados impiedosamente por explosões causadas por terroristas inspirados na Al-Qaeda. O combate ao terrorismo islâmico global é uma guerra assimétrica, com resultados imprevistos e consequências sem precedentes e, portanto, agora é necessária uma nova jurisdição internacional para resolver esta questão.
De facto, as pequenas e médias empresas representam 99% de todas as empresas europeias, geram a maior parte do valor acrescentado e criam dois terços dos empregos no sector privado. A UE baseia-se em PME e está a criar condições para que estas possam desenvolver-se e crescer, para criarem empregos em mercados competitivos.
De facto, como aliás refere o relator, a União Europeia tem ainda um peso insuficiente nos órgãos das Nações Unidas, tendo em conta os importantes contributos da própria UE e dos seus Estados-Membros. É necessário que o Conselho faça ouvir com maior vigor a sua posição no seio deste órgão, garantindo uma maior coordenação na consecução dos objectivos da União no âmbito das Nações Unidas e favorecendo uma maior coesão entre as posições dos Estados-Membros.
De facto, compreendo a importância, que foi muito bem sublinhada pela relatora, de uma maior cooperação entre os intervenientes na cena política, com o objectivo de desenvolver e levar a cabo projectos mais ambiciosos e úteis para todos os cidadãos. É bem sabido que as populações das regiões fronteiriças têm mais probabilidades de sofrer de falta de infra-estruturas; por conseguinte, a participação de todas as partes envolvidas poderá levar à satisfação das necessidades de todas essas populações, mesmo no caso das populações que estão mais distantes do centro da Europa.
De facto, enquanto aguarda que uma verdadeira diplomacia comum e uma verdadeira política europeia de defesa se tornem realidade, o "poder suave” e a diplomacia cultural são dos poucos meios de influência que a Europa tem à sua disposição.
De facto, esta questão devia constar da primeira parte do nosso debate, mas posso responder ao Excelentíssimo Senhor Deputado dizendo que, ao longo dos anos, a posição da Comissão tem sido muito aberta e mesmo receptiva à ideia das euro-obrigações. Um dos meus antecessores foi até o primeiro a avançar com essa ideia.
De facto, estamos a pedir ao Banco Europeu de Investimento e à Comissão Europeia que se proceda a uma investigação sobre as actividades do Banco Europeu de Investimento lá para finais de Setembro do corrente ano, para que possamos iniciar o próximo procedimento de quitação com documentação adequada.
De facto, estes dois países adoptaram o acervo de Schengen quando aderiram à União Europeia, em 2007.
De facto, foram criadas disposições especiais de salvaguarda para as importações de têxteis e de vestuário originárias da República Popular da China e foram eliminadas restrições quantitativas às importações com origem em países membros da Organização Mundial do Comércio.
De facto, no relatório adoptado sem qualquer dificuldade na Comissão da Cultura e da Educação e, durante a sessão plenária do Parlamento Europeu, salientámos a importância de os Estados-Membros estarem envolvidos no processo de execução e serem acompanhados pela Comissão Europeia.
De facto, nota-se uma clara aceleração dos pedidos de mobilização deste instrumento, que aproxima a União das classes trabalhadoras. A sua indispensável sustentabilidade não é, assim, posta em causa.
De facto, não nos podemos esquecer que a União Europeia ainda é a única zona do mundo que adoptou objectivos de redução das emissões juridicamente vinculativos. A consequência imediata é que a indústria europeia está exposta a uma forte concorrência dos concorrentes mundiais que não estão submetidos às mesmas restrições. Portanto, na minha opinião, a prioridade da União Europeia deveria ser, num primeiro momento, alcançar os objectivos 20-20-20 estabelecidos no Pacote Clima-Energia, que são já bastante ambiciosos.
De facto, não vejo como poderemos ter uma agricultura competitiva a médio e a longo prazo sem uma gestão cuidadosa dos recursos naturais.
De facto, o direito dos contratos determina e organiza as transacções no interior do mercado interno, sendo por conseguinte óbvio o seu potencial tanto no sentido de prejudicar como de facilitar essas transacções.
De facto, o relatório, tal como outros relatórios análogos incluídos no pacote de governação económica, propõe essencialmente a intensificação da supervisão e do controlo centrais das economias dos Estados-Membros individuais, o que poderia enfraquecer, de forma gradual e substancial, o papel e a liberdade das próprias economias nacionais.
De facto, o valor do mercado global estimado era de 124 mil milhões de euros em 2008, projectando-se que atinja os 230 até 2025.
De facto, os Eurobonds já existem. O Banco Europeu de Investimento (BEI) concede empréstimos com a garantia dos 27 Estados-Membros.
De facto, para manter o controlo das importações de produtos têxteis ainda sujeitos às restrições quantitativas e que têm a sua origem na Bielorrússia e na Coreia do Norte, que ainda não são membros da Organização Mundial do Comércio, a UE recorre às autorizações de importação. Isso ajuda a evitar o problema das distorções do mercado que seriam provocadas por um aumento das importações de determinados produtos têxteis para o mercado da UE, caso as quotas autorizadas não fossem respeitadas.
De facto, são cada vez mais precisas novas formas sustentáveis para uma utilização mais inteligente e eficaz dos recursos e matérias-primas. É por isso necessário criar espaço para novas ideias e, mais importante que tudo, criar os mecanismos necessários para pôr essas ideias em prática.
De facto, temos a obrigação de proporcionar aos trabalhadores na Europa uma oportunidade de se adaptarem às exigências da economia.
De facto, uma das grandes inovações do Tratado de Lisboa foi dar ao Parlamento Europeu, não somente o direito de dar o seu assentimento final aos acordos internacionais de comércio e outros depois de negociados, mas também o direito de ser informado sobre todos os passos das negociações desde o seu início.
De facto, verifica-se que 11 das 22 comissões parlamentares permanentes apresentaram pareceres sobre este relatório.
De facto, é inaceitável que a União Europeia, a região do mundo mais aberta ao investimento estrangeiro, não possa operar nos mercados dos seus parceiros industrializados em condições equitativas.
De forma análoga, apoiamos a constituição de serviços orçamentais independentes, de normas financeiras nacionais e de um quadro orçamental plurianual obrigatório que proporcione maior estabilidade económica e monetária.
De futuro, a cooperação entre as forças policiais e as autoridades judiciais em matéria de reconhecimento mútuo não deveria constituir a nossa única preocupação; temos de considerar igualmente a criação de normas processuais. Não obstante, o Mandado de Detenção Europeu deve ser alterado hoje, e a sua execução é claramente incompatível com as normas que solicitámos, sobretudo ao nível da verificação da proporcionalidade em casos individuais.
De igual modo, a deficiência também não deve ser um obstáculo, e é por isso que devem ser reservados fundos adicionais para os jovens com deficiências.
De igual modo, este desafio também está relacionado com os Estados-Membros que já pertencem ao espaço Schengen.
De igual modo, novas áreas de competência como as relacionadas com o espaço de liberdade, segurança e justiça reclamam o fortalecimento dos seus meios e da sua capacidade de acção. O modo como os conflitos no Mediterrâneo se irão desenvolver pode justificar meios acrescidos para fazer face às suas consequências.
De igual modo, não podemos envolver-nos em movimentações de bastidores, numa tentativa hipócrita de cultivar os chamados "valores europeus" em solo inóspito.
De igual modo, os projectos financiados no âmbito do programa temático para a migração e o asilo contam geralmente como APD.
De igual modo, parece pertinente salientar no contexto dos compromissos da União Europeia no que se refere aos contratos públicos a nível internacional, a importância do reforço de mecanismos anticorrupção no domínio dos contratos públicos e chama a atenção para a necessidade de concentrar esforços que garantam a transparência e a equidade na utilização de fundos públicos; solicita que o Parlamento Europeu seja devidamente informado e que lhe sejam fornecidas todas as informações disponíveis em todos os estádios e no final do processo.
De modo a apoiar a continuação do desenvolvimento do sistema EGNOS e a assegurar que o sistema não fique privado do financiamento europeu, votei a favor da presente proposta.
De modo geral, concordo com a concretização dos objectivos 20-20-20 que já foram estabelecidos, porém, a escala e os custos dos compromissos relacionados com a possível adopção de uma redução de 30% dos gases com efeito de estufa seriam enormes.
De modo semelhante, o respeito pelos princípios "Think Small First" (pensar primeiro em pequena escala) e "só uma vez" e a limitação das transposições demasiado rígidas dos requisitos das directivas da UE para os regulamentos nacionais, por parte, naturalmente, dos organismos dos Estados-Membros, iriam originar uma assinalável redução dos encargos administrativos que pesam sobre o sector das PME.
De momento, a opção privilegiada é uma "caixa de ferramentas", porque daria resposta a necessidades actuais, enquanto disposições específicas para os tipos mais frequentes de contratos seriam uma ajuda genuína para os consumidores.
De onde vem este poder do senhor Presidente Barroso? Não é verdade que a ajuda financeira à Grécia é expressamente proibida pelo Tratado de Lisboa? Não é verdade que essa ajuda terá de ser aprovada por todos os parlamentos nacionais? Não é verdade que estes poderão dizer "não”?
De preferência, precisamos de uma abordagem global.
De qualquer forma, não é permitido nos termos do Regimento.
De qualquer modo, neste momento, a Bulgária e a Roménia não podem ser os bodes expiatórios de problemas não resolvidos relacionados com a segurança na Europa: a vaga de refugiados provenientes de África, as eleições próximas em alguns Estados-Membros, a retórica populista e a decepção causada pela crise financeira e económica.
De que forma pretende o Comissário reproduzir à escala comunitária as práticas de excelência existentes na Alemanha, nos Países Baixos e na Áustria?
De que necessitamos então, de facto? Em primeiro lugar, todos os membros deste Parlamento que trouxeram a Grécia à área do euro devem admitir a sua culpa, designadamente o Ministro das Finanças belga, Didier Reynders. É evidente que este facto nunca deveria ter acontecido.
De que serve a autodeterminação quando assenta em acções ditatoriais ou onde serve para justificar o que é indizível? A autodeterminação, e mesmo uma maioria absoluta, não dão a nenhum governo o direito de negar os valores universais.
De que servem reactores produtivos que não resistem ao avanço de uma massa de água ou a um terramoto? De que serve a central nuclear mais produtiva, se basta uma pequena falha para tornar inabitável, durante décadas, não só o espaço adjacente mas vastas regiões? É importante que nos concentremos mais na segurança nuclear e no desenvolvimento de alternativas.
De salientar a proposta de reserva das receitas de custos externos e infra-estruturas para serem usadas, em particular, nos transportes sustentáveis e nas redes transeuropeias.
De um modo geral, a Bielorrússia não está preparada para desenvolver energia nuclear, e o Governo russo não só não responde às perguntas feitas pelos países vizinhos, como também ignora os pedidos de consultas da sua própria população. Recusa-se, pela segunda vez, graças ao recurso à burocracia, a autorizar o registo de uma iniciativa relativa a um referendo público sobre a questão da construção de uma central nuclear.
De um modo geral, a gestão dos fluxos migratórios na UE e em cada Estado-Membro exige uma gestão eficaz das fronteiras.
De um modo geral, considero que o pacote legislativo agora apresentado, desenvolvido a partir da legislação pertinente e em consonância com a estratégia Europa-2020 e outros documentos estratégicos da UE, constitui uma resposta adequada à crise global e à actual situação económica na UE e, como tal, recomendo a sua aprovação, na versão alterada.
De um modo mais geral, partilhamos convosco a preocupação de assegurar a correcta execução do orçamento da UE. Examinámos minuciosamente as contas anuais da Comissão, bem como as observações formuladas pelo Tribunal de Contas Europeu no seu relatório anual.
De um ponto de vista sistémico, o próprio Comité do Risco Sistémico considera que isto é importante, e eu creio que se a qualidade do trabalho realizado pela ABE, com o apoio de V. Exa. e sob a supervisão do Comité do Risco Sistémico, significar que podemos muito bem arquivar essas cláusulas absolutamente ridículas que os Estados-Membros procuraram incluir no pacote de supervisão, então teremos dado um passo em frente.
De uma maneira geral, o programa de ajustamento está a avançar. O último relatório de execução, elaborado conjuntamente pela Comissão, o FMI e o BCE em Março, concluiu que o programa continua a apresentar progressos para a realização dos seus objectivos.
De uma penada, fica clara a marca ideológica do relatório: o problema do emprego como um problema individual e não eminentemente social, tendo o indivíduo (e não a sociedade) que o resolver, seja aumentando a sua empregabilidade, seja tornando-se empreendedor; um sistema fiscal amigo dos lucros e, por conseguinte, que carregue prioritariamente sobre o trabalho e o consumo; a educação e a formação totalmente ao serviço dos interesses do capital.
Debate sobre casos de violação dos direitos humanos, da democracia e do Estado de direito(debate) 
Debatemos todos os aspectos de todas as propostas a vários níveis.
Debruçando-me agora sobre o conteúdo do relatório, a Comissão pode apoiar - por vezes com pequenas alterações - quase toda a abordagem do Parlamento. A Comissão congratula-se em particular, e concorda, com a posição tomada no relatório sobre um par de questões. Em primeiro lugar, a importância do espectro para que a Agenda Digital forneça a todos os cidadãos um acesso de banda larga de alta velocidade. Não há dúvida sobre isso, estamos completamente ao vosso lado.
Decidi abster-me de votar este relatório sobre a proposta de regulamento do Conselho que altera o Regulamento (CE) n.º 1467/97 do Conselho relativo à aceleração e clarificação da aplicação do procedimento relativo aos défices excessivos.
Decidi abster-me na votação final porque perdemos a alteração 1 sobre a referência à NATO, a alteração 3 contra a dimensão nuclear na política comum de segurança e defesa, a alteração 4 contra a utilização flexível dos grupos tácticos (Battlegroups), a alteração 5 contra a utilização dos grupos tácticos (Battlegroups) para funções mistas civis/militares, a alteração 6 que suprimia uma disposição relativa à investigação no sector da defesa, a alteração 7 que suprimia uma disposição relativa à investigação no sector da defesa, a alteração 8 que suprimia a referência ao Department of Homeland Security (Departamento de Segurança Nacional) dos EUA, a alteração 9 que suprimia a referência à cooperação da PCSD com a Frontex no Mediterrâneo, e apesar do facto de termos ganho a alteração 2 sobre as estruturas de trabalho permanentes do Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa/Comissão e a alteração 1 que dizia não ao desenvolvimento de capacidades civis pela NATO.
Decidi votar contra a proposta porque o seu impacto seria muito negativo, sobretudo para as pequenas empresas de transporte rodoviário. É certamente correcto lutar contra a poluição e procurar descongestionar o tráfego, mas introduzir mais uma taxa não é, quanto a mim, a melhor solução. Com a aplicação da Eurovinheta, é muito provável que só consigam sobreviver as maiores empresas de transportes - ou seja, aquelas que dispõem de mais recursos.
Decidi votar contra quatro das seis propostas incluídas no pacote relativo à governação económica por considerar que apenas contêm medidas de austeridade que tornariam a economia europeia ainda mais frágil.
Decidimo-nos por apresentar agora uma proposta relativa a um imposto sobre as transacções financeiras precisamente porque, entre outras razões, não há um equivalente do IVA para essas operações. Apresentaremos, pois, essa proposta até Outubro.
Decidir sobre o cultivo de culturas geneticamente modificadas deve caber a cada um dos EstadosMembros. A proposta de que os agricultores que cultivam estas culturas não possam receber o pagamento único é totalmente desprovida de sentido. Há escassez de alimentos no mundo.
Declaração do Presidente da Delegação do Parlamento Europeu ao Comité de Conciliação - Novos alimentos (continuação do debate) 
Declarações escritas (Artigo 149.º do Regimento)
Declarações escritas inscritas no registo (artigo 123.º do Regimento): Ver Acta
Declaro que votei favoravelmente esta resolução, pois entendo que vai de encontro ao princípio de Legislar Melhor e dá prioridade à modernização das regras sobre os contratos públicos e concessões, o que constitui uma melhoria significativa do direito da UE.
Declaro reaberta a sessão do Parlamento Europeu, que tinha sido interrompida na quinta-feira, 9 de Junho de 2011.
Decorre claramente, não apenas destas convenções, mas também do relatório da Comissão Mundial sobre a Dimensão Social da Globalização, a necessidade de mudar o estreito enfoque nos mercados para o interesse mais geral nas pessoas, ou seja, para um enfoque na protecção dos direitos dos trabalhadores e no primado do direito do trabalho.
Decorreram dois anos desde que adoptámos uma directiva sobre a segurança nuclear e, desde então, tem sido atribuída uma atenção crescente à segurança na exploração das centrais nucleares.
Decorrido um ano, além da Grécia, mais dois países da zona euro, a Irlanda e Portugal, tiveram de recorrer ao mecanismo de apoio, por serem incapazes de assegurar o necessário financiamento nos mercados.
Dedicarei especial atenção a este problema no relatório em que estou actualmente a trabalhar. O esforço empreendido pela senhora deputada Honeyball e, em particular, a adopção de uma abordagem centrada nas crianças, constituirão uma excelente base de referência no futuro. O projecto de relatório "chama a atenção para a importância geral dos estudos antes da entrada na escola, sobretudo a aprendizagem de línguas, bem como o multilinguismo e a diversidade linguística”, que apoio com todo o gosto e entusiasmo.
Dediquei toda a minha atenção às propostas relativas às medidas de mercado. O reforço da capacidade de gestão e do poder de negociação dos produtores e das suas organizações, a transparência dos preços e outras medidas de gestão dos riscos são matérias que irei analisar em pormenor no âmbito da avaliação de impacto.
Defende uma estratégia agressiva no que respeita às matérias-primas e considera que se faz, passo a citar, "uma distinção demasiado rígida entre operações de gestão de crises militares e civis". Isto é uma maneira disfarçada de defender uma maior militarização da política externa. O relatório saúda ainda o acordo comercial com a Colômbia, apesar de nos últimos anos terem sido ali assassinados centenas de sindicalistas cuja única culpa era o facto de serem sindicalistas.
Defende-se o reforço da Agenda Urbana Europeia, o desenvolvimento de infra-estruturas físicas de base e o seu contributo para o tecido económico, a sustentabilidade energética e ambiental, através de investimentos baseados no progresso tecnológico, mas as pessoas são deixadas para um segundo plano.
Defendemos a produção de alimentos da mais elevada qualidade pelos nossos agricultores.
Defendemos o princípio, consagrado na Convenção das Nações Unidas sobre o Direito do Mar, de que o acesso concedido à UE deve dizer respeito às quantidades que a frota da Mauritânia não seja capaz de capturar.
Defendemos, além disso, que todos os partidos se devem empenhar num diálogo contínuo e construtivo para abordar as questões pós-referendo, incluindo fronteiras comuns, regime de cidadania para os cidadãos do Norte e do Sul do Suão, e a partilha de rendimentos do petróleo.
Defendendo ser importante ter em consideração a experiência adquirida durante os anos da existência do anterior PEC e, por outro lado, ter igualmente em consideração o aumento da democraticidade da governação económica através do reforço do papel do Parlamento Europeu em todo o processo de supervisão, votei favoravelmente o presente relatório.
Defendo que a PAC continue com 2 pilares em que a estrutura e os objectivos de cada um deles sejam bem definidos e concebidos de forma a que se complementem mutuamente.
Defendo todos os seres humanos que vivem neste planeta, para que eles possam viver em liberdade e igualdade - todos eles!
Defesa da imunidade parlamentar de Bruno Gollnisch (
Dei o meu apoio à proposta de resolução em apreço, pois considero inteiramente legítima a pretensão da União Europeia de reforçar a sua presença no seio das organizações internacionais.
Deixar por aproveitar ou esbanjar desnecessariamente os recursos disponíveis seria algo de terrivelmente lamentável, pelo que está correcto adoptar urgentemente uma abordagem orientada para os resultados, através do estabelecimento de metas claras e mensuráveis e de indicadores de resultado. O primeiro passo, que deveria aplicar-se a todos os recursos comunitários, consiste em simplificar procedimentos e tornar a atribuição de fundos mais flexível, reduzindo barreiras burocráticas, custos administrativos excessivos e outros obstáculos que entravam objectivos em matéria de emprego e de luta contra a pobreza. Não esqueçamos que a política de coesão é um mecanismo a longo prazo; logo, começar a trabalhar sobre bases sólidas e estabelecer objectivos precisos e atribuindo competências claras a cada nível de governação são factores de progresso que irão produzir resultados visíveis apenas na segunda parte do período de programação.
Deixará mais claro aos cidadãos de onde devem proceder os fundos.
Deixei espaço suficiente para poder apaziguar todos os envolvidos e alcançámos um bom resultado. O meu relatório tinha, portanto, uma grande margem.
Deixem que lhes explique, porque não me parece que tenham de facto percebido. É porque os políticos gastam sempre mais dinheiro do que aquele que arrecadam por via dos impostos - mais dinheiro do que é razoavelmente possível arrecadar através da tributação -, a maior parte do qual eles de facto desperdiçam. O motivo pelo qual estamos a falar de países que estão falidos - e eles estão mesmo falidos - é porque os seus políticos ridículos, ineficazes e ignorantes teimam em gastar mais dinheiro do que aquele que conseguem arrecadar.
Deixem-me dar-lhes um exemplo do que poderia acontecer: na Bélgica, melhoraram os motores das frotas depois da última crise e agora as frotas belgas gastam menos 20% de combustível.
Deixem-me recordar que o Tribunal de Contas Europeu, num recente relatório especial sobre avaliações de impacto nas instituições da UE, confirmou que o sistema de avaliação de impacto da Comissão "tem sido eficaz no apoio à tomada de decisão no seio das instituições da UE" e no melhoramento da qualidade das nossas propostas. O Tribunal constatou ainda que a Comissão dispõe das estruturas necessárias para a regulamentação inteligente e que o Comité para as Avaliações de Impacto ajuda claramente a elevar a qualidade das nossas avaliações de impacto.
Deixemos de lado as dúvidas morais de que a indústria nuclear europeia se aproveitará desta oportunidade para se livrar de resíduos indesejáveis à custa de outros países.
Deixemos de lamentar os 2,5% de despesa pública com que devemos manter todo o sistema necessário para aplicar a Estratégia UE 2020 e cumprir todas as responsabilidades que nos foram atribuídas no âmbito do tratado de Lisboa. Não gizámos a estratégia e as competências: foram os Estados-Membros a fazê-lo. Tendo em conta estas realidades, o relatório do senhor deputado Garriga Polledo é modesto.
Deixo também uma palavra muito especial aos vários relatores-sombra que nos ajudaram nas nossas tarefas e, por fim, saúdo o extraordinário trabalho que o Conselho fez em relação a esta matéria, referindo, em especial, o Andràs Kármán, que muito nos acompanhou, e o seu Comissário Olli Rehn, que também teve uma participação preciosa em todo este processo.
Deixámos margem de manobra, por exemplo, no que respeita ao tipo de participação pública, à educação e formação dos empregados e gestores, aos pormenores dos modelos financeiros - não à qualidade do financiamento -, e estamos a deixar em aberto, deliberadamente, a regulação das instalações de armazenagem definitiva construídas e/ou exploradas conjuntamente por vários EstadosMembros.
Demos também resposta a preocupações dos cidadãos relativamente à segurança do combustível nuclear eliminado, e apoiámos o princípio da reversibilidade.
Denominações das fibras têxteis e correspondente etiquetagem de produtos têxteis (debate) 
Dentro de dois anos - até 2013, o mais tardar - a Comissão deverá apresentar um relatório e, se possível, propor também uma revisão desta directiva.
Dentro de um mês terá nascido um novo Estado. Não obstante, subsistem algumas preocupações, especialmente após os recentes episódios de violência na disputada região de Abyei.
Dentro deste espírito, a nomeação das individualidades que o compõem tem de se reger por critérios de competência e independência. O Senhor H. G. Wessberg (SV) apresentou o seu Curriculum Vitae, respondeu a um questionário escrito e foi ouvido na Comissão do Controlo Orçamental, tendo apresentado argumentos suficientes para justificar a nomeação para o Tribunal de Contas para aí desempenhar as suas funções de forma competente e independente.
Dentro do pacote legislativo destinado a reforçar a governação económica na UE e na zona do euro, foi igualmente votado o presente projecto de parecer que diz respeito à proposta da Comissão que altera o regulamento relativo à aceleração e clarificação da aplicação do procedimento relativo aos défices excessivos.
Dentro dos limites extremamente exíguos do orçamento comunitário, que os senhores desta União Europeia não parecem dispostos a alterar, impedindo qualquer perspectiva de convergência e coesão efectivas, há opções fundamentais a fazer.
Dentro em breve iremos submeter a votação o pacote sobre governação económica, que define medidas responsáveis, a fim de aderir ao Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento, de sanear as finanças públicas e de permitir a retoma do crescimento. A política de coesão é o segundo pilar sobre o qual se deve basear este crescimento, um crescimento sustentável, inteligente e inclusivo.
Deparámo-nos com casos de, por exemplo, trabalhadoras que entraram no país com diplomatas e a quem foram retirados os passaportes; pessoas que nessa situação praticamente não têm liberdade, não têm acesso a apoio e não conhecem os seus direitos.
Dependendo embora dos recursos financeiros, civis e militares existentes, a Europa pode tomar medidas ainda mais decisivas em caso de catástrofes naturais e de origem humana e participar de forma ainda mais activa no que respeita a evitar e gerir crises e conflitos, e estabelecer uma paz duradoura em países terceiros.
Depois da Bulgária e da Roménia terem feito grandes esforços e enfrentado, com êxito e de forma admirável, os critérios técnicos de Schengen, atrasar a adesão de ambos os países seria ir contra as regras estabelecidas na União Europeia.
Depois de as grandes potências imperialistas terem retalhado o continente africano no seu interesse, tudo leva a crer que está reaberto no Sudão do Sul um processo que conduzirá a mais guerras e sofrimento para as já muito massacradas populações africanas.
Depois de consultar organizações de defesa dos direitos dos consumidores e representantes do mundo empresarial, entendo que devemos insistir numa harmonização ainda maior dos direitos dos consumidores em toda a União Europeia.
Depois de muitos debates, conseguimos manter uma abordagem racional da nossa gestão dos resíduos radioactivos.
Depois de os Estados-Membros terem aceitado compromissos políticos estratégicos a longo prazo e de carácter totalmente europeu, não é possível negar-lhes o financiamento.
Depois de recebermos a petição, a Comissão perguntou ao Governo austríaco de que modo se tinha assegurado de que a directiva fora devidamente aplicada neste projecto. A Áustria respondeu que não tinha tido de efectuar uma AIA porque não se tinha atingido o limiar de 20 hectares.
Depois de tudo isto, chegou o momento de a esquerda cancelar a sua campanha política provocadora contra o Governo húngaro baseada em deturpações. A nova Constituição húngara é um instrumento importante para afastar as ruínas deixadas por oito anos de governação socialista corrupta e incompetente. O Fidesz recebeu mandato por maioria de dois terços para realizar este trabalho. A esquerda tem de aceitar que esta decisão não pode ser alterada em Bruxelas, nem em Estrasburgo.
Depois do fracasso da chamada "Estratégia de Lisboa”, que tinha por objectivo que a UE se tornasse, em 2010, a economia do conhecimento mais competitiva e mais dinâmica do mundo, decidimos apreciar se a avaliação do PQ7 constituiria uma oportunidade para consolidar o triângulo de ouro formado pelo conhecimento, a formação e a investigação. Consideramos que o PQ7 constitui uma boa ocasião para a UE elevar a sua política de investigação à altura das suas ambições económicas e sociais, nomeadamente consolidando o Espaço Europeu de Investigação. Além disso, as políticas de investigação e desenvolvimento devem ser territorializadas e a União deve aprovar um plano europeu de investigação ambicioso em matéria de tecnologia de defesa, na perspectiva de um reforço da base industrial e tecnológica do sector da defesa, melhorando simultaneamente a eficácia da despesa pública a nível militar. A concluir, concordamos com a Comissão dos Orçamentos quanto ao facto de que a concepção e a execução de todos os programas-quadro devem assentar nos princípios da simplicidade, estabilidade, segurança jurídica, coerência, excelência e confiança, reforçando, por outro lado, as ligações entre as instituições de investigação e a indústria.
Depois do que sucedeu recentemente no Japão, é crucial que sejam realizados testes de stress nas centrais nucleares europeias para avaliar níveis de risco e impacto na saúde, evitar potenciais desastres e aliviar a preocupação do público. O facto de não ter sido realizado um teste de stress em Sellafield, que está localizada a poucas centenas de quilómetros da costa da Irlanda, representa uma enorme preocupação para o povo da Irlanda. A Irlanda está numa situação de risco em virtude dessas centrais nucleares situadas na costa britânica.
Depois dos Estados Unidos, a UE é o maior parceiro comercial do Canadá, e este é o 11.º parceiro comercial mais importante da UE. As negociações em curso para um acordo económico e comercial global (CETA) aspiram a um acordo muito amplo, cujo grau de ambição exceda todo e qualquer acordo comercial e económico negociado pela UE ou pelo Canadá até à data.
Depois dos resultados negativos já conhecidos na Grécia, na Irlanda, em Portugal, das lutas dos seus trabalhadores, era tempo de arrepiar caminho e de não continuar a insistir em beneficiar apenas grupos económicos e financeiros sobretudo das potências europeias. O que agora propõem estes diplomas legislativos visa perpetuar estas medidas de ingerência, de submissão dos povos e dos países, transformando em autênticos protectorados ou colónias, aprofundando um caminho que só pode conduzir ao desastre económico e social e à própria implosão da União Europeia.
Depois pedem emprestado vezes sem conta e - pior ainda - imprimem dinheiro, porque os políticos e os seus bancos centrais têm uma máquina que imprime dinheiro.
Depois, disse também que a Comissão deve começar a analisar a possibilidade de emissão de obrigações europeias - finalmente, é caso para dizer.
Depois, há a questão de garantir uma política agrícola comum mais direccionada O senhor deputado Ashworth mencionou este ponto, mas vejo que já não se encontra aqui. A Comissão está a propor pagamentos directos mais direccionados.
Depois, há o evidente baixo custo de tratamento nos países terceiros, que é o principal factor económico que encoraja ou favorece estas transferências ilegais. Há ainda a situação muito grave dos países que acolhem, por assim dizer, estes resíduos, estas transferências ilícitas que estão na origem de uma poluição significativa do ar, da água, do solo e das habitações, e que ameaçam - como V. Exa. disse há pouco, Senhora Deputada Wils, e como a senhora deputada Bearder e a senhora deputada Rosbach disseram com a mesma emoção antes de si - a saúde das pessoas, e especialmente a das crianças, que é o mais escandaloso, assim como a saúde dos trabalhadores e de uma parte da população. A natureza, já em si tóxica, das substâncias perigosas contidas nos resíduos representa frequentemente um risco acrescido quando são utilizadas técnicas de gestão de resíduos inadequadas, como muitas vezes acontece nesses países de destino.
Depois, há um impacto a longo prazo sobre a saúde. A TV mostrou-nos que 25 anos após a catástrofe as mulheres ainda têm abortos.
Deposito grandes esperanças neste acordo, uma vez que é tão ambicioso.
Deposito uma grande esperança no trabalho levado a cabo pelo Senhor Comissário Barnier no domínio dos concursos públicos, que visa uma simplificação através de uma harmonização dos procedimentos, da redução da margem de erro, contribuindo assim significativamente para a simplificação. Devemos colaborar através da apresentação de propostas relativas aos montantes forfetários, etc.
Desafios semelhantes advêm das alterações climáticas, de inesperadas carências de matérias-primas e de ameaças biológicas, como o recente surto de bactérias E. coli em legumes. O caminho para encontrar soluções para situações tão invulgares é o investimento na ciência e no desenvolvimento tecnológico.
Desaponta-nos o facto de, na verdade, não haver nesta resolução uma proposta concreta para o cancelamento da dívida e para uma análise das dívidas externas.
Desde 1963 que a Síria se encontra sob legislação de emergência, o que permitiu a execução de pessoas sem julgamento, mas poucas delegações europeias - uma delas foi a delegação da UE - levantaram a questão. O comércio e as finanças tiveram prioridade sobre os direitos humanos.
Desde 1994 que não se registou qualquer alteração nas nossas relações com Moscovo, muito embora tenhamos, sem dúvida, necessidade de actualizar o nosso Acordo de Parceria e Cooperação, coisa que devia fazer-se acompanhar de verdadeiro progresso no domínio da democracia e do Estado de direito.
Desde 2000, data da disponibilização do serviço GPS, que este sector tem apresentado um crescimento exponencial (124 mil milhões de euros, em 2008) prevendo-se que, em 2025, tenha um valor global de mercado na casa dos 230 mil milhões de euros. A UE, em 2008, decidiu criar um sistema próprio de navegação por satélite (Regulamento (CE) n.º 683/2008), o Galileu e o EGNOS (Serviço Europeu Complementar de Navegação Geoestacionário), com o objectivo de assegurar a independência e a autonomia da Europa, de aumentar a sua quota de mercado e de fornecer à indústria condições de competitividade num mercado estratégico e em franco crescimento.
Desde 2001, os números das viagens desceram 10% na Suíça, enquanto a quantidade de mercadorias transportadas aumentou 60% e se provou ser possível reduzir as emissões, cenário em que todos saem a ganhar. A aplicação das receitas visa promover a aceitação pela opinião pública e reduzir os custos externos do transporte rodoviário.
Desde 2006, estava em vigor um protocolo que terminou no dia 17 de Janeiro de 2011. A Comissão Europeia, consciente da importância da renovação desta parceria e na sequência do mandato conferido pelo Conselho, negociou, com o Governo das Seicheles, um novo quadro de parceria assente no desenvolvimento de uma política das pescas sustentável.
Desde 2009, data do primeiro relatório intitulado A dimensão urbana da política de coesão no novo período de programação, que se verificaram novos contributos e uma evolução desta questão. O presente relatório pretende dar continuidade ao anterior salientando vários aspectos da dimensão urbana da política de coesão que a Comissão do Desenvolvimento Regional identifica como cruciais ou problemáticos para a futura política de coesão, a qual se deverá tornar uma política inteiramente válida e eficaz para as cidades da UE. Votei favoravelmente dada a importância crucial deste tema para a valorização das cidades de pequena e média dimensão. Concordo com o alerta do relator para o facto de a abordagem projectos para fundos deve ser substituída pela abordagem fundos para projectos.
Desde Maastricht, existem critérios concebidos para evitar situações perigosas, e nós vimos como eles falharam estrondosamente.
Desde a compreensão de que os recursos do Fundo de Estabilidade tinham de ser aumentados até ao reconhecimento do facto de as taxas de juro punitivas não proporcionarem sustentabilidade e a possibilidade de regressar aos mercados, esta Assembleia não teve receio de assumir a liderança, e o Conselho seguiu-nos.
Desde a década de 1980, os EUA desenvolveram enormes esforços no domínio da investigação, há a obrigação de notificação e existe uma autoridade de controlo de doenças centralizada, em Atlanta, dotada de amplos poderes para uma intervenção directa caso ocorra uma epidemia desta natureza.
Desde a década de 1990, a União Europeia foi palco de um crescimento exponencial das indústrias culturais e criativas (ICC), em termos de criação de emprego e de contribuição para o produto interno bruto. A natureza destas indústrias é dual: numa perspectiva económica, contribuem para criar empregos e crescimento e, numa perspectiva cultural, facilitam a integração social dos cidadãos. O Livro Verde da Comissão reconhece oficialmente a importância económica e social deste sector da economia.
Desde a entrada em vigor do Tratado de Lisboa, o Parlamento Europeu passou a dispor de mais competências para intervir na celebração de acordos internacionais entre a União Europeia e países terceiros. O relatório do senhor deputado Brian Simpson, hoje aprovado, permitirá assim definir melhor o papel do Parlamento nas negociações internacionais em matéria de aviação.
Desde a primeira hora, a Comissão Europeia levou a cabo uma monitorização constante do INDECT.
Desde a sua criação, já foram acrescentadas várias correcções e compensações, tornando o mecanismo de receitas da UE totalmente iníquo e tudo menos transparente.
Desde então, o Governo do Sri Lanka tem tentado exonerar-se e impedir o acesso à justiça aos cidadãos que, no mínimo, deveriam ser considerados vítimas de crimes de guerra.
Desde então, registaram-se poucos progressos neste domínio. A União Europeia carece ainda de uma estratégia eficaz para a sua segurança externa e continua a seguir os Estados Unidos na maioria das questões relevantes.
Desde já congratulo-me com os esforços demonstrados pela União Europeia no sentido de erradicar a pobreza nos países em desenvolvimento. A cooperação internacional direccionada para promover a auto-suficiência e independência destes países é o caminho certo para atingir a paz social e política a nível mundial, que terá não só efeitos essenciais na vida das populações ajudadas, como também levará à resolução de problemas como a imigração a nível europeu.
Desde logo, nas nossas áreas urbanas, nas nossas cidades, que têm, por um lado, muito boa conectividade e, por outro lado, personalidade cultural forte e muito diferenciada, muita diversidade.
Desde o exercício dos testes de stress bancários do ano passado, sabemos que os bancos gregos detêm títulos do Tesouro no valor de 48 mil milhões de euros, obrigações de dívida pública grega. O que aconteceria? Uma restruturação dos títulos soberanos minaria gravemente a sua base de capital.
Desde o fiasco do pacote de resgate do euro, os contribuintes líquidos acabam por pagar não apenas o orçamento da UE através do enorme mecanismo de redistribuição, mas também, na verdade, por pagar duas e três vezes mais.
Desde o início da crise económica e financeira que não se fala de outra coisa senão das agências de notação de crédito.
Desde o início, o senhor deputado Garriga Polledo e eu quisemos apresentar um relatório que pudesse ser apoiado por três quartos do Parlamento.
Desde o seu início até aos dias de hoje, a PAC passou por uma série de reformas que provam que o seu apoio à agricultura está em constante evolução, para melhor responder ao grande número de desafios que temos tido de enfrentar.
Desde que assumiu a Presidência da UE, a Polónia já encontrou caminhos para um diálogo mais frutífero com a Rússia, pelo que nos próximos seis meses podemos esperar medidas concretas no âmbito das relações UE-Rússia.
Desde que cheguei ao Parlamento Europeu, defendi em muitas ocasiões a segurança nuclear na UE. Uma tecnologia tão arriscada de produção energética, com todos os seus subprodutos perigosos e com consequências fatais para os seres humanos e a natureza em caso de colapso do reactor, não deve ser camuflada com o pretexto da protecção climática.
Desde que os nossos deputados foram acusados de terem aceitado dinheiro de "falsos" membros de grupos de interesse em troca de entrega de alterações, a instituição tem tentado esclarecer e reformar as regras que regem a actividade dos membros de grupos de interesse no Parlamento.
Desejamos negociações rápidas com o Conselho, de modo a que esta questão não fique em banho-maria e se encontre rapidamente uma solução.
Desejamos resolver as questões em aberto e conduzir a uma integração. Se permitirmos o enfraquecimento da nossa posição devido à fraqueza do Conselho, não teremos retirado quaisquer ensinamentos desta crise.
Desejo agradecer a todos este debate tão empenhado e o enorme apoio do Parlamento às nossas políticas.
Desejo aqui destacar a atitude responsável demonstrada por este sector e a sua total cooperação com as autoridades do meu país.
Desejo desde já felicitar o Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência pelo relevante trabalho que tem vindo a desenvolver no sentido de reduzir a quantidade de drogas e dos fenómenos a estas associados no espaço europeu.
Desejo que o trílogo para o orçamento de 2012 decorra num clima construtivo e que não deixe de ter presente as principais carências e preocupações dos europeus e, também, que concorra para dotar a União dos meios adequados a cumprir adequadamente as suas atribuições e as competências que delas decorrem.
Desejo relatar os problemas por que passou um outro cidadão grego que se me queixou de uma desventura semelhante em consequência da publicidade fraudulenta e me deu todos os documentos relevantes.
Desejo saudar a aprovação deste relatório e sublinhar a importância do Objectivo 3, que diz respeito à cooperação territorial, na política de coesão da União Europeia. O nosso Parlamento apela a um aumento na percentagem dos Fundos Estruturais destinados a este objectivo - dos actuais 2,5% para 7% - e apoio energicamente esta posição. O Objectivo 3 deve ser mantido e, ainda mais importante, desenvolvido, para podermos levar a cabo a integração do território da Comunidade através das fronteiras nacionais.
Desejo sublinhar o facto de que práticas deste tipo já estão interditas nos diversos Estados-Membros nos termos da Directiva 2006/114/CE relativa à publicidade enganosa e comparativa, e da legislação anti-fraude.
Desejo, aliás, pedir ao Senhor Comissário Andris Piebalgs que, na sua resposta, explique o que tem a UE vindo a fazer para combater as contínuas e crescentes violações dos direitos humanos, em particular no que diz respeito a defensores dos direitos humanos, como Hawa Abdullah, da missão conjunta de paz UA-ONU, que foi arbitrariamente detido e alvo de violência física.
Desenganem-se, pois, aqueles que pensam que o problema é dos gregos, dos irlandeses e dos portugueses - não é. Se não houver uma resposta firme da União Europeia, que acalme os mercados, a pressão vai estender-se a outros Estados-Membros.
Desenvolvemos um bom painel de avaliação, embora tenham sido necessárias longas discussões. Gostaria de agradecer sinceramente à relatora, senhora deputada Ferreira, pela sua cooperação positiva neste contexto.
Desenvolvemos um trabalho árduo nos últimos meses e, por conseguinte, gostaria de agradecer pessoalmente à senhora deputada Paulsen, aos relatores-sombra e a todos os grupos parlamentares pelos seus contributos valiosos para a criação de um texto comum neste domínio. A competitividade futura da criação animal europeia pode depender de como gerimos este problema, e a sua natureza transversal exige empenho e responsabilidade, através de uma abordagem coordenada e de uma vontade política comum.
Desenvolvimento rural, medidas ambientais e medidas orientadas para as regiões desfavorecidas - deve colocar-se uma tónica clara nestas matérias.
Designadamente, para estabelecer uma verdadeira democracia é necessário, em primeiro lugar, promover a sociedade civil, em segundo lugar acabar com o controlo do Estado, em especial sobre as ONG, em terceiro lugar ter um sistema judicial verdadeiramente independente e, por último, ter uma oposição livre e forte.
Desinvestimento que se tende a acentuar na sequência de processos de liberalização e de privatização. O relatório em causa, abordando algumas destas questões, mais não faz do que procurar impor uma nova tributação sobre os veículos pesados de mercadorias (a somar às actualmente existentes - algumas recentemente aumentadas em Portugal), de eficácia duvidosa quanto à efectiva prossecução dos objectivos enunciados, e representando um encargo adicional, cujos efeitos, em face da actual crise económica e social, poderão gerar situações liquidatárias para muitas empresas.
Desperdiçou-se dinheiro dos contribuintes, e nós não devemos repetir este erro. O Tribunal de Contas Europeu denuncia uma percentagem significativa de irregularidades que afectam diferentes domínios políticos, que representam 2,8% do orçamento ano após ano, e nós continuamos a enviar fundos para estas regiões. Alguns projectos têm custos até três vezes superiores às suas estimativas iniciais; outros sofrem atrasos e são ultrapassados por tecnologias superiores. É o caso do Galileo, que passou de um orçamento de 7,7 mil milhões de euros para um orçamento de 22,6 mil milhões de euros.
Dessa forma, a iniciativa Juventude em Movimento é emblemática da Estratégia Europa 2020, e visa reforçar a atractividade do sistema de ensino superior na Europa, a qualidade global de todos os níveis de ensino e formação e a mobilidade dos estudantes e dos trabalhadores através de um melhor aproveitamento dos programas europeus existentes. É assim essencial o apoio a esta iniciativa, para que no futuro tenhamos jovens cada vez mais qualificados e preparados para a concretização dos objectivos da estratégia Europa 2020.
Desse modo, a maioria, se não mesmo todas, as práticas comerciais desleais entre empresas no sector retalhista seriam cobertas e regidas pelo mesmo conjunto de regras que as práticas comerciais desleais na relação das empresas face aos consumidores, com as quais há geralmente sobreposições.
Desse modo, estaremos não só a promover a segurança alimentar, mas também uma agricultura mais sustentável e amiga do ambiente, e que assegure uma melhor gestão dos recursos e contribua para o combate às alterações climáticas.
Desta forma, a União pode conferir realmente valor acrescentado às suas políticas.
Desta forma, apoio a proposta apresentada por este Parlamento no sentido de pedir à Comissão que conduza uma avaliação de impacto e um estudo sobre os custos, benefícios e estrutura de governação de uma Fundação de Notação de Crédito Europeia competente nos vários sectores de rating: o sector público, as empresas e os instrumentos de financiamento.
Desta forma, apoio o relatório apresentado sobre a União da Inovação, realçando a sua importância na conjuntura actual e no sucesso europeu nos tempos que se seguem.
Desta forma, concordo com a referida proposta de directiva relativa ao espaço de manobra, às facilidades de acesso ao lugar de condução, assim como às portas e janelas dos tractores agrícolas e florestais de rodas.
Desta forma, concordo com a referida proposta de directiva relativa aos dispositivos de protecção referentes aos tractores agrícolas ou florestais com rodas de via estreita.
Desta forma, concordo com a referida proposta de directiva relativa à travagem dos tractores agrícolas ou florestais de rodas.
Desta forma, concordo com a referida proposta de regulamento relativo aos valores faciais e às especificações técnicas das moedas em euros destinadas a circulação. Considero ser mais eficiente o sistema proposto de codificação, elaborado através de um sistema de processamento de dados.
Desta forma, e tendo em consideração a importância do comércio dos géneros alimentícios, concordo com a referida proposta de directiva, relativa às menções ou marcas que permitem identificar o lote ao qual pertence um género alimentício.
Desta forma, estamos a repetir a nível europeu os erros que vários países cometeram nos últimos anos.
Desta forma, mantemos sérias dúvidas sobre o limite das potenciais utilizações destes programas, num quadro de competição, quer entre funcionalidades e eficiências destes sistemas, quer entre a UE e os EUA.
Desta forma, podemos assegurar que estes países beneficiem de tantas oportunidades como outros locais. São necessários recursos, porque conhecemos os problemas e os perigos que existem na região.
Desta forma, podemos proporcionar condições equitativas para todos os Estados-Membros no que respeita à avaliação com base na excelência.
Desta forma, podemos tornar a nossa sociedade mais habitável, aumentar a eficiência do sector e ainda contribuir para condições mais equitativas entre os diferentes modos de transporte, para que, assim, também possamos proporcionar maiores oportunidades aos caminhos-de-ferro e às vias navegáveis interiores.
Desta forma, poderíamos dar um contributo considerável para a melhoria da situação do mercado de trabalho.
Desta vez, a Polónia recorreu ao Mandado de Detenção Europeu. Há dez dias, o senhor Disselkoen foi enviado para a Polónia. O seu advogado afirma que o seu cliente foi detido numa prisão tão insalubre e sobrelotada como as instalações em que esteve detido em 1997.
Destaca igualmente que o reforço das sinergias entre os Fundos Estruturais é essencial não só para a consecução dos objectivos da Europa 2020, mas também e principalmente para a consecução dos objectivos da política de coesão. O relatório do senhor deputado Stavrakakis solicita que as medidas de desenvolvimento rural tomadas ao abrigo do FEADER e as medidas de desenvolvimento sustentável no domínio das pescas que contam com o apoio do FEP sejam integradas num único enquadramento com os restantes fundos estruturais, solicitando ainda uma melhor coordenação entre os instrumentos da política de coesão como tal e as acções levadas a cabo ao abrigo do Sétimo Programa-Quadro e do Programa-Quadro de Competitividade e Inovação.
Destaco a conclusão tardia das negociações sobre o Quadro Financeiro Plurianual e do pacote legislativo desta política, que originam a realização tardia das estratégias e programas operacionais nacionais e a escassez de recursos públicos disponíveis para co-financiamento em Estados-Membros. É imperioso enfrentar estas questões para que os objectivos do processo sejam plenamente alcançados.
Destaco a necessidade de futuramente serem promovidas as seguintes grandes linhas: um financiamento adequado dentro dos recursos disponíveis; a incidência na erradicação da pobreza e nos critérios de APD; programas geográficos e temáticos, processos de programação da ajuda da UE, melhor coordenação e repartição das tarefas e colmatar o défice democrático, chamando o Parlamento Europeu a tomar parte no processo decisório.
Destaco das medidas propostas a criação de critérios objectivos de admissibilidade que permitam avaliar a idoneidade dos candidatos para funções de controlo, tendo em conta a natureza, complexidade e dimensão da instituição financeira.
Destaco do âmbito destas negociações a ênfase atribuída à protecção do sector das PME na Índia, sugerindo-se que todos os programas de cooperação para o desenvolvimento entre a UE e a Índia tenham como objectivo fortalecer as PME com medidas de ajuda ao financiamento de projectos locais orientados para o mercado.
Destaco os seguintes pontos de interesse do mandato conferido para o trílogo: 1) as dotações a prever no orçamento de 2012 da União para financiar a Estratégia UE 2020, 2) a proposta de revisão do actual Quadro Financeiro Plurianual (2007-13) para ter em conta as necessidades financeiras adicionais do projecto ITER, e 3) a sustentabilidade financeira e a boa gestão da categoria 4 em 2012, em particular tendo em conta a próxima carta rectificativa com vista a fazer face à transição democrática no Sul do Mediterrâneo.
Deste modo não levamos alimentos da Europa, pondo fim aos meios de subsistência dos agricultores locais e em seguida damos-lhe apoio ao desenvolvimento e levamos ainda mais alimentos porque não fomos sensatos na nossa abordagem à ajuda alimentar.
Deste modo, a política agrícola comum poderá incorporar vários aspectos - aspectos económicos, aspectos ambientais, aspectos associados às alterações climáticas e aspectos associados à harmonização territorial nas zonas rurais - nos objectivos propostos nesta reforma.
Deste modo, conseguimos ser bem-sucedidos no sentido de impedir o Parlamento Europeu de adoptar uma posição demasiado centrada em regulamentos vinculativos em matéria de governo das sociedades. É de enorme importância que o nosso grupo promova uma abordagem equilibrada no sentido da resolução da crise financeira à escala global. É por este motivo que temos de evitar a introdução de barreiras nas instituições financeiras. O relatório final atribui maior importância e dá mais poder ao papel desempenhado pelas Autoridades de Supervisão Europeias. O compromisso mais importante envolve colocar em pé de igualdade o princípio "cumprir ou explicar" e os regulamentos vinculativos.
Deste modo, e uma vez que a política urbana está integrada nos objectivos da política de coesão, esta deve servir de elo de ligação com as áreas rurais para potenciar um desenvolvimento inclusivo.
Deste modo, estaremos a contribuir - pelo menos - para a ampliação do programa "Trabalho Digno". Estaremos a apoiar o mundo e muitos cidadãos, mas estaremos sobretudo a contribuir para a nossa própria dignidade e respeito pelos outros, enquanto instituição e enquanto europeus, bem como para que o nosso continente mantenha o seu modelo social, que não subsistirá se formos uma ilha de protecção e de direitos num mundo de miséria e de falta de protecção.
Deste modo, felicito as conclusões e observações elencadas no Livro Verde e a oportunidade de melhorar o governo das instituições financeiras através da União, e acompanho o relator na sua solicitação de uma avaliação do impacto das propostas da Comissão, em termos de custos/benefícios, centrada na necessidade de preservar a competitividade e de contribuir para o crescimento económico.
Deste modo, o relator propõe a definição de alguns princípios gerais para facilitar e melhorar tais avaliações. Embora reconheça, em princípio, os benefícios de tais acordos, o relator não renuncia a uma abordagem diferenciada e, em diversas ocasiões, apela a um diálogo construtivo entre a Comissão e o Parlamento.
Deste modo, para introduzir um sistema desse tipo, é necessário avaliar adequadamente o impacto da sua aplicação, definir os seus objectivos de forma mais específica e indicar perspectivas claras para o ulterior desenvolvimento das contas económicas do ambiente.
Deste modo, pedimos, e voltamos agora a pedir, à Comissão, que equacione uma maior flexibilidade no financiamento e, mais especificamente, uma maior integração entre o Fundo Europeu Agrícola de Desenvolvimento Rural e o Fundo de Coesão.
Deste modo, tenho a convicção de que devia tirar pleno partido do potencial de que já dispõe, em virtude do seu cargo, para resolver esta questão espinhosa, que envolve directamente a UE.
Deste ponto de vista, é muito difícil abordar o segundo grande tema da reunião do Conselho, ou seja, a migração. Existe, no entanto, uma nítida ligação entre as duas questões, porque, relativamente à questão da migração, em particular Schengen, vemos o mesmo princípio a funcionar, ou seja, vemos um dos maiores êxitos da Europa ser posto agora em causa por motivos que se prendem com o egoísmo nacional.
Deste valor, 20 % provêm de Sistemas de Transporte Inteligentes e 5 % de aplicações de segurança, incluindo aplicações de segurança dos transportes.
Deve basear-se num modelo de fundação e o capital inicial deve ser fornecido pelo sector financeiro em forma de empréstimos geradores de juros.
Deve destacar a incapacidade dos Estados-Membros para implementarem as regras da UE em matéria de imigração. Por último, a Comissão tem de investigar as alegações de que 61 imigrantes terão sido abandonados à sua morte, apesar de terem estabelecido contacto com a guarda costeira italiana, um navio de guerra da NATO e um helicóptero militar.
Deve existir também um maior controlo por parte das autoridades educativas competentes nos países em causa, verificando se é necessário eliminar obstáculos adicionais levantados a nível da administração ou a nível das associações comerciais.
Deve fazer-se mais ao nível da UE e ao nível mundial para garantir que a segurança financeira da UE não seja ameaçada por práticas negligentes.
Deve haver dupla contagem de presentes, viagens e almoços para os funcionários e políticos; noutras palavras, tanto o doador como o receptor devem declarar os presentes.
Deve incentivar-se a mobilidade dos criadores. A União Europeia deve trabalhar a fim de elaborar um estatuto jurídico europeu para que os criadores possam usufruir de condições de trabalho justas, bem como de protecção social.
Deve introduzir o imposto financeiro e as euro-obrigações. Votei, portanto, contra os relatórios Feio e Wortmann-Kool, mas abstive-me em relação aos relatórios Ferreira, Ford e Haglund e votei a favor do relatório Goulard (relativo às euro-obrigações). Um conjunto de decisões de voto que pretende ser a tradução dos meus sentimentos contraditórios relativamente a este pacote, que oferece, certamente, alguns avanços, mas que continua a ser demasiado desequilibrado: a Europa não poderá desenvolver-se sem as pessoas, devemos debater publicamente as soluções para o futuro.
Deve monitorizar e verificar se esta abordagem é traduzida nos países vizinhos, sobretudo aqueles que pretendem construir centrais nucleares próximas das fronteiras externas da UE, e se as disposições das convenções internacionais estão a ser devidamente implementadas, ou não passam de pouco mais do que um pedaço de papel.
Deve prestar-se atenção ao facto de um novo regulamento resultar em grande confusão e falta de clareza neste domínio.
Deve ser atribuída particular importância ao princípio da reversibilidade e aos requisitos em matéria de exportação.
Deve ser atribuída uma maior importância aos indicadores que medem estes factores. O desenvolvimento de métodos de medição qualitativos e quantitativos deve ter como base os indicadores do Inquérito Europeu sobre a Qualidade de Vida (IEQV), que contemplam os principais domínios da qualidade de vida.
Deve ser creditado à Comissária Reding o facto de ter tido a candura de afirmar que sim, que este mandado tem problemas e levanta dúvidas e que há testes de proporcionalidade que devem ser passados quando são emitidos os mandatos, os quais não devem ser aplicados automaticamente sem que sobre eles seja deitado um olhar mais demorado e discriminado de um juiz.
Deve ser dada uma maior atenção à aplicação, nas instituições financeiras, de medidas que permitam aumentar a percepção dos riscos, pois uma maior sensibilização para os riscos existentes a todos os níveis da instituição - inclusive entre os trabalhadores - é determinante para uma melhor gestão dos riscos.
Deve ser dado um forte apoio a uma combinação de políticas educativas com um novo sistema de assistência social baseado em incentivos para as empresas que criem emprego a tempo inteiro para os jovens e as mulheres. É essencial assegurar que as competências adquiridas sejam conformes às competências - nomeadamente em matéria de cidadania - necessárias para cumprir os novos objectivos de um crescimento sustentável e inteligente, sendo igualmente fundamentais políticas para a transição do ensino para o local de trabalho e a aceleração do reconhecimento das qualificações profissionais, dos títulos e dos créditos académicos.
Deve ser encontrado um equilíbrio entre o reforço dos direitos dos consumidores e a redução das formalidades administrativas.
Deve ser feita uma especial menção às microempresas de zonas regionais e rurais, que lutam pela sobrevivência devido à falta de financiamento, de modo a encontrarmos maneiras de fomentar o uso de soluções inovadoras, melhorando desse modo a sua viabilidade.
Deve ser sublinhado que não podemos impor mais requisitos à Roménia e à Bulgária do que aqueles que foram impostos a anteriores pedidos de adesão ao espaço Schengen.
Deve ser tido em consideração que a zona constituída pela Bulgária, pela Turquia e pela Grécia é uma das regiões mais delicadas das fronteiras externas da UE em termos de imigração ilegal. É essencial, portanto, que a Bulgária adopte medidas adicionais, incluindo um plano especial que inclua medidas a aplicar no momento da entrada no espaço Schengen e uma abordagem comum (entre a Grécia, a Turquia e a Bulgária) para poder dar resposta ao possível aumento dos fluxos migratórios.
Deve ser visto, antes, como o resultado de uma redução da produção industrial e de um movimento de deslocação dessa mesma produção para o exterior, por via da qual o desemprego está a crescer na Europa.
Deve ser, pelo contrário, o reforço desse tratado. Há precedentes que indicam claramente que, face a pressões migratórias bruscas e imprevistas, como as que se registaram no arquipélago espanhol das Canárias entre 2004 e 2006, a resposta não pode ser apenas mais e melhor Europa - tem de incluir também uma contribuição solidária para a satisfação da exigência de melhor democracia nos países vizinhos.
Deve ser-lhes proporcionada a oportunidade de se desenvolverem, e importa ajudá-los para que possam adquirir novas competências numa economia que se torna cada vez mais internacional. A Juventude em Movimento não é apenas uma oportunidade para os jovens se tornarem activos e começarem a trabalhar, antes é, acima de tudo, uma forma de eles ultrapassarem as suas limitações e fragilidades e uma hipótese de se desenvolverem.
Deve também pôr-se termo aos conflitos de interesses inerentes às agências de notação de crédito, que actualmente podem publicar notações actuando ao mesmo tempo como consultoras.
Deve, pelo contrário, dar-se-lhes a oportunidade de reorganizarem os recursos pesqueiros e de reenquadrarem os seus factores de produção, encontrando ferramentas para poupança de energia.
Deve-se, neste aspecto, tentar focar as prioridades e visar reafectações dos recursos. Há ainda outras áreas que devem ter um equivalente a nível orçamental, como a da Justiça, Liberdade e Segurança, e é igualmente necessário reagir aos acontecimentos na região do Mediterrâneo.
Devem abranger todas as categorias de propostas legislativas e seguir uma metodologia clara. O Parlamento insta igualmente à criação de uma estrutura autónoma de avaliação de impacto no Parlamento, com vista a melhorar a qualidade da legislação e a criar sinergias.
Devem assegurar transparência no que respeita aos seus bens, aos seus interesses no erário público e ao reembolso de despesas de campanha, ou, por outras palavras, no que respeita aos dinheiros que receberam efectivamente de entidades públicas nos seus próprios países durante as suas campanhas eleitorais.
Devem mesmo existir peritos culturais associados ao Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa, para que a cultura possa ser integrada na política externa da UE de uma forma mais coerente e mais sistemática.
Devem ser criadas possibilidades de financiamento mais alargadas, simplificadas e facilmente acessíveis utilizando as verbas disponíveis do Fundo Social Europeu e do Programa de Aprendizagem ao Longo da Vida.
Devem ser postos em prática mecanismos adicionais para assegurar que usufruam das mesmas oportunidades que todas as outras pessoas.
Devem ser saudados, portanto, controlos mais rigorosos, e eu espero que a nova autoridade europeia consiga funcionar na sua capacidade máxima, com poderes reais para intervir e mesmo para impor sanções sempre que necessário.
Devem ser tomadas medidas concretas no sentido de repatriar os refugiados ilegais e os refugiados políticos cujos requerimentos tenham sido rejeitados.
Devemos abordar este debate sem enaltecer virtudes - a senhora baronesa Ashton salientou, correctamente, alguns elementos positivos; eu gostaria de destacar a boa, ou antes, a melhor troca de informação entre o Parlamento Europeu e o Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa (SEAE) - mas sem ocultar defeitos, e houve uma voz bastante sensata, a de Giorgio Napolitano, antigo colega nosso e Presidente da República Italiana, que nos recordou isso recentemente.
Devemos abster-nos de usar o apoio orçamental em países onde a transparência nas despesas públicas não possa ser garantida. O apoio orçamental deve ser sempre acompanhado de acções tendentes a desenvolver o controlo parlamentar e as capacidades de auditoria do país beneficiário e a aumentar a transparência e o acesso do público à informação, e a sociedade civil deve ser envolvida no controlo desse apoio orçamental.
Devemos agora garantir que a tragédia não foi tempo perdido tirando dela as devidas ilações: temos de decidir quais as melhores formas de criar um sistema de rastreabilidade transfronteiriço vigoroso e de estabelecer uma célula de comunicação europeia, assim como uma célula de gestão de crises.
Devemos agora procurar reforçar a uniformidade das regras de importação através do alinhamento das regras relativas à importação de têxteis com as de outros bens industriais, o que também deve melhorar a coerência global do enquadramento legal neste domínio.
Devemos ajudar igualmente os nossos fabricantes no que se refere aos medicamentos, mas penso que todos concordaremos que isso não deverá ser feito em detrimento daqueles que dependem do acesso a medicamentos baratos.
Devemos ajudá-los, para podermos ser fiéis a nós próprios e aos nossos princípios comuns.
Devemos apoiar a RSE, e não regulamentá-la. Neste caso, o papel da Europa deve ser o de moderador, e não o de regulador.
Devemos apoiar fortemente e desenvolver este domínio tão descurado da educação e da formação, tanto ao nível da UE como nos Estados-Membros.
Devemos apoiar os jovens que enveredam por uma carreira na agricultura, não só para fomentar o desenvolvimento rural, mas também para assegurar a renovação geracional do sector, que é de importância vital para o futuro a médio e a longo prazo da agricultura europeia.
Devemos centrar os nossos esforços em reforçar a protecção contra a radiação e no armazenamento final. É uma questão de vida ou de morte alterarmos as nossas prioridades, ou seja, travar a expansão da energia nuclear e trabalhar nos aspectos relacionados com a segurança. O presente programa de investigação, naturalmente, não o prevê. Tomei isso em consideração ao votar.
Devemos centrar-nos em medidas políticas que não impliquem mais encargos administrativos para os nossos agricultores, a fim de não dificultarmos ainda mais a sua vida.
Devemos concentrar-nos em reduzir os obstáculos burocráticos que todas as pequenas empresas enfrentam e em procurar que o mercado único seja um verdadeiro valor acrescentado através da cooperação em matéria de direitos de propriedade intelectual, de uma patente europeia e da realização de todo o potencial da Agenda Digital, bem como, naturalmente, da eliminação das incoerências na legislação da UE em vigor, nomeadamente no que se refere ao IVA.
Devemos condenar todos aqueles que pretendem utilizar as crenças religiosas como um meio de opressão, e apoiar aqueles que advogam a tolerância, na Síria, no Paquistão, no Egipto ou onde quer que seja.
Devemos criar emulação entre as ICC, mas sem perder de vista as especificidades de cada uma dessas indústrias e o facto de exigirem modalidades de apoio diferenciadas. A União Europeia deve adoptar medidas de apoio ao sector criativo.
Devemos dar continuidade a esses contactos, de modo a evitar a duplicação daquilo que fazemos - simplesmente para poupar dinheiro.
Devemos dar mais ênfase às propostas de colaboração em matéria de investigação entre os sectores público e industrial, facilitar a cooperação entre redes de PME, universidades e institutos públicos de investigação, e os principais critérios de selecção dos projectos no âmbito do PQ7 devem agora incluir uma avaliação do impacto potencial no mercado, transferência de tecnologia e utilização comercial dos resultados da investigação. Votei a favor da avaliação do PQ7 pelos motivos que expus e para que a UE possa ser mais competitiva no domínio da investigação sem ter de esperar pelo Oitavo Programa-Quadro.
Devemos dar prioridade precisamente a esses investimentos no crescimento, por razões que incluem o princípio da concentração.
Devemos desenvolver novos modelos sociais para encontrarmos um equilíbrio justo entre um acesso facilitado para os utilizadores e uma remuneração adequada dos criadores de novos conteúdos.
Devemos dispensar mais atenção à qualidade do trabalho desenvolvido com as regiões, em particular quando constatamos que alguns países estão confrontados com verdadeiros problemas estruturais.
Devemos encontrar soluções que tornem a criação artística atractiva na União Europeia e, por outro lado, garantir uma presença competitiva a nível internacional.
Devemos esforçar-nos por alcançar a igualdade de oportunidades, para que todas as crianças, independentemente de serem provenientes de zonas urbanas ou rurais, ou de famílias ricas ou pobres, tenham acesso à aprendizagem na primeira infância.
Devemos estar conscientes de que, se admitimos que a política de coesão é uma política dirigida apenas aos mais pobres, terá, nesse caso, de ir lentamente acabando, ou seja, deve desaparecer lentamente até ser suprimida da lista das políticas europeias.
Devemos estimular a educação multidisciplinar e permitir maiores intercâmbios entre instituições de ensino superior deste sector. A Comissão tem de garantir a segurança jurídica das tecnologias da informação e da comunicação de modo a proteger os consumidores e os criadores de inovação. Deve igualmente apoiar as autoridades locais e regionais no desenvolvimento de redes de cooperação no domínio do turismo cultural. A Irlanda, sobretudo o sul da ilha, possui uma história cultural e criativa rica.
Devemos exigir aos países que não pretendem aderir à UE que respeitem o direito de associação e que tomem medidas para evitar a discriminação em razão do género ou da idade. A abolição do trabalho infantil e o direito dos cidadãos à melhoria das suas qualificações profissionais são questões muito importantes.
Devemos fazer todos os esforços para os apoiar, assim como aos cidadãos do Sri Lanka, em vez de os atacar.
Devemos ignorar o facto de o mercado das obrigações espanholas nos estar a dizer que os espanhóis vão ser os próximos.
Devemos igualmente baixar a taxa de juro e flexibilizar o acesso aos fundos da UE. Por seu lado, a Grécia deve estar preparada para tomar o seu destino nas próprias mãos. Não nos esqueçamos de que, embora necessárias, as reformas e as medidas de austeridades não são, a longo prazo, suficientes para a recuperação. Temos de regressar às questões essenciais, promover o investimento e fomentar o crescimento.
Devemos igualmente recordar o papel da formação contínua, porque é ela que promove a aprendizagem ao longo da vida e prepara as pessoas para as alterações no mercado de trabalho.
Devemos igualmente ter a coragem de fazer avançar estas decisões, de garantir o seu cumprimento, mesmo que tenhamos de nadar contra a maré. Compreendemos as pessoas que protestam nas ruas e, sobretudo, as nossas medidas destinam-se a dar uma resposta estrutural precisa às preocupações desses cidadãos: bons empregos, um crescimento sustentável e espaço no futuro para uma política social adequada.
Devemos incentivar os governos a, além de aumentarem os recursos orçamentais atribuídos todos os anos à investigação, definirem uma percentagem do seu orçamento como um limiar mínimo que tem de ser utilizado em projectos relacionados com investigação e desenvolvimento.
Devemos instar os Chefes de Estado ou de Governo a garantirem que esta questão se torne uma questão europeia comum no Conselho. Não pode suceder no Conselho, como tem sucedido no passado, que o grupo de trabalho nuclear se oponha a tudo o que venha da Europa.
Devemos opor-nos a todas as tentativas de restringir os contactos entre os cidadãos, e devemos opor-nos a todas as tentativas de restringir a liberdade de viajar e de trabalhar na União Europeia. O debate que tenho estado a ouvir mostra até que ponto a União Europeia está hoje dividida.
Devemos opor-nos veementemente a qualquer tentativa de repetição deste tipo de acto na Europa e devemos demarcar-nos claramente das forças políticas na Europa que estão por trás destes actos.
Devemos ouvir o que as comunidades querem, iniciar uma construção com base na sua lista de prioridades e acreditar que os autarcas são quem melhor sabe o que devem ser as prioridades para as suas cidades. É precisamente por isso que acredito firmemente, tal como o relator, que a oferta de financiamento da UE deve ir ao encontro da procura local e dos princípios de planeamento estratégico a nível da UE. Por conseguinte, a Agenda Urbana Europeia deve contribuir para reduzir disparidades nas áreas estratégicas de que qualquer cidade europeia moderna precisa, nomeadamente infra-estruturas, investigação e inovação, transportes, ambiente, educação, saúde e cultura.
Devemos ouvir o que os europeus, que são os primeiros a sofrer os efeitos económicos e sociais da crise, dizem de nós: só austeridade é intolerável. O pacote "governação" deve ser compensado por um plano de investimento europeu que garanta um desenvolvimento económica e socialmente sustentável.
Devemos perguntar se é razoável reciclar todas as actuais ajudas regionais através de Bruxelas, ou se a execução dos recursos poderia ser mais eficaz se os recursos fossem afectados directamente às regiões dos Estados-Membros. A política regional da UE é prejudicada pela burocracia e por abusos. Há muita burocracia tanto na UE como nos Estados-Membros, o que originou uma situação em que muitas empresas inovadoras, novas e antigas, não se candidatam a fundos ou apoios porque seria necessário empregar uma ou duas pessoas para se ocuparem da candidatura, e isso ocuparia muito tempo.
Devemos permitir aos operadores do mercado, em particular os investidores institucionais, que possuem pessoal especializado, voltar a assumirem eles próprios a responsabilidade e a não delegar a responsabilidade no caso das decisões de investimento. É preciso deixar claro que os investidores só devem investir se compreenderem o que o produto financeiro envolve e que não possam alegar que podem, de certa forma, converter automaticamente um produto classificado com "triplo A" no objectivo da sua estratégia de investimento.
Devemos preparar-nos para este tipo de situação no futuro e resolver também os problemas da crise que existem fora da Europa, e não unicamente os que existem em território europeu.
Devemos promover a utilização do EGNOS e do Galileo na aviação civil e contribuir, assim, para a criação do programa de Investigação sobre a Gestão do Tráfego Aéreo no Céu Único Europeu e facilitar a sua implementação. É fundamental que os programas europeus de radionavegação por satélite sejam adaptados a serviços multimodais e aplicados em toda a Europa e não apenas em alguns países, pois a implementação eficaz dos programas referidos iria aumentar a eficácia do transporte de mercadorias e ajudar a resolver muitas das questões existentes a nível de segurança nos transportes e ambientais.
Devemos proteger os sectores mais sensíveis das duas partes e excluí-los do âmbito dos acordos de investimento. A Comissão deve permanecer firme na posição da UE relativamente à proibição de produtos derivados da foca e, neste contexto, o Canadá deve retirar o pedido formulado à OMC com vista à criação de um painel oficial de resolução de litígios.
Devemos recordar o papel importante que as florestas desempenham na prestação de serviços socioeconómicos, assim como o seu contributo fundamental para o combate às alterações climáticas.
Devemos reflectir profundamente sobre as qualificações, que devem poder ser transferidas e reconhecidas em toda a UE. Temos igualmente de estudar o acesso, para que todos os que necessitarem dos serviços de educação na primeira infância possam dispor deles.
Devemos saudar este relatório, que destaca a importância dos objectivos da Estratégia "Europa 2020”: combater o desemprego dos jovens através de medidas eficazes e eficientes como, por exemplo, a redução da taxa de abandono escolar para menos de 10% e o aumento da proporção dos jovens que completam o ensino superior para pelo menos 40%. O que não é uma linha de chegada mas sim um ponto de partida: o estabelecimento de ligações entre as universidades e as empresas e o regresso aos estágios/aprendizagens obrigatórios financiados por organismos públicos ou privados devem ser as prioridades seguintes. Não temos muito tempo para ponderações - devemos agir já. Caso contrário, a herança que deixamos às gerações futuras será muito pesada.
Devemos ser capazes de os ouvir e de lhes dar credibilidade e confiança. Só assim conseguiremos criar uma Europa que as novas gerações irão encarar como uma oportunidade e não como um peso.
Devemos ser muito realistas e reconhecer que, na presente conjuntura, a divisão pacífica do Sudão está em perigo. A ocupação da região disputada de Abyei pelas forças governamentais sudaneses em 21 de Maio e a violência que prosseguia ontem, tal como em Kadugli, mostram-nos que a guerra civil entre o Norte e o Sul pode recomeçar em qualquer altura.
Devemos também certificar-nos de que os procedimentos da condicionalidade não geram encargos adicionais, mas que, pelo contrário, procuram reduzir os encargos, e que não provocam atrasos na implementação das políticas, dos programas ou dos projectos.
Devemos também ponderar a possibilidade de colocar em reserva parte da despesa com pessoal, para o caso de o programa TFTP (Programa de Detecção do Financiamento do Terrorismo) da UE - que só foi discutido na Comissão e não, até agora, na Comissão das Liberdades Cívicas - não se vir a realizar.
Devemos também procurar assegurar uma melhor informação dos cidadãos sobre os seus direitos enquanto consumidores.
Devemos ter consciência deste triste facto e tentar proporcionar o que nos for possível no mundo real em que vivemos. Não obstante, acredito muito no poder da cultura para possibilitar o entendimento mútuo e para promover a inovação e o crescimento económico.
Devemos ter em mente que a Bulgária e a Roménia adoptaram o acervo de Schengen (protecção de dados, Sistema de Informação Schengen, fronteiras aéreas, fronteiras terrestres, fronteiras marítimas, cooperação policial e vistos) quando aderiram à União Europeia, em 2007.
Devemos ter presente o valor de 12 000 - impressiona-me muito que tenhamos, no meu círculo eleitoral de Londres, detido os bombistas de Julho de 2005.
Devemos ter presente que, se perdermos os antibióticos como armas, regressaremos ao tempo dos nossos antepassados, em que as doenças infecciosas que hoje consideramos triviais, como uma otite numa criança, se poderão tornar novamente doenças fatais. Não se trata de uma situação de fácil resolução e temos de a levar a sério.
Devemos velar por que os cidadãos das zonas rurais tenham acesso a serviços públicos como os serviços de educação, de saúde, de transporte, de desporto e de cultura.
Devemos zelar pelas futuras gerações e pela qualidade da sua educação.
Devemos, com carácter imediato, oferecer-nos para estabelecer parcerias e ajudar a lidar com esta catástrofe - sobretudo tendo em atenção o debate que acabámos de realizar sobre o Paquistão. Da cimeira terão de sair decisões concretas, nomeadamente no que se refere à cooperação na limpeza das zonas contaminadas e à investigação e desenvolvimento conjuntos no domínio das fontes de energia renováveis.
Devemos, das duas uma, ou suprimir o n.º 29 ou alterar a respectiva formulação e dizer que nos preocupa o facto de existirem possivelmente bens fabricados com recurso a trabalho infantil. A meu ver, existe na actual versão um laivo de superioridade, com a Europa a dizer: "Nós acabámos com o trabalho infantil mas vocês, na Índia, continuam a utilizá-lo". Não é esta a relação que devemos ter com um parceiro comercial muito importante.
Devemos, desde já, procurar melhorar os níveis de educação, fomentar a inclusão social, nomeadamente através da redução da pobreza, e fomentar o desenvolvimento de uma sociedade do conhecimento baseada na capacidade científica e tecnológica global da UE. Assim, é necessário apoiar a investigação, o desenvolvimento, a inovação e as PME. O montante do projecto de orçamento da UE para 2012, tal como proposto pela Comissão, é de 147 435 milhões de euros em dotações para autorizações e de 132 738 milhões de euros em dotações para pagamentos.
Devemos, naturalmente, centrar os nossos esforços no apoio às regiões que registam um maior atraso para que se aproximem das restantes, através do Objectivo 1.
Devemos, pois, dar tempo à Grécia para privatizar aquilo que for sensato privatizar numa altura em que o possa fazer por um preço adequado.
Devemos, por isso, evitar a fuga de cérebros da Europa para outras regiões - quanto mais não seja, a Europa deve ser um pólo de atracção para investigadores de outras partes do mundo.
Devemos, sem dúvida, investir muito mais na criação de um espaço público comum europeu. O ensino, como já foi realçado neste debate, pode dar um contributo muito importante, se não mesmo crucial, para esse fim.
Devemos, sobretudo, desenvolver os aspectos em que seja possível avançar. Um exemplo é o avanço registado relativamente aos acordos sobre a flexibilização planeada e eventual eliminação definitiva do regime mútuo de vistos com a Rússia.
Dever-se-ia prever o alargamento do âmbito de aplicação da Directiva relativa às Práticas Comerciais Desleais de modo a abarcar todas as práticas comerciais numa relação das empresas face aos consumidores, visando a protecção quer dos consumidores, quer dos concorrentes.
Deveremos continuar a trabalhar para melhorar o ambiente e reduzir os níveis de dióxido de carbono na Europa, pelo que é de importância crucial que asseguremos que as taxas ambientais sejam efectivamente utilizadas para reduzir e eliminar os problemas ambientais que possam surgir.
Deveremos igualmente ter em conta os nossos interesses comerciais e acautelá-los a longo prazo, estabelecendo um período de validade ideal, bem como as condições que devem ser cumpridas pelo Paquistão. As inundações que assolaram o Paquistão de forma catastrófica no Verão de 2010 tiveram um efeito desastroso para a economia do país. A UE pretende ajudar o Paquistão, contribuindo para a reconstrução económica do país. Tendo em conta que o Paquistão é de extraordinária importância para a segurança da UE devido à sua posição geoestratégica, tudo devemos fazer para estabilizar a situação no país. Desta forma, evitaremos a radicalização da opinião pública no Paquistão. Uma economia mais estável traz sempre consigo uma sociedade mais democrática e um a afastamento face aos moimentos sociais anti-democráticos e radicais.
Deveremos, pelo contrário, optar pelo caminho da poupança energética e das fontes de energia renováveis. A este respeito, apoio o Senhor Comissário Günther Oettinger no que se refere à nova proposta sobre eficiência energética, que trará certamente poupança, quer aos cidadãos, quer às empresas, apoiando-os na gestão dos seus próprios consumos.
Deveria estar discriminada na Constituição, como é norma nos países europeus, como tem sido norma nas democracias mais avançadas e mais progressistas.
Deveria ser dado um ênfase particular à formulação de regulamentos que garantam uma maior eficiência do espectro, um melhor planeamento em matéria de frequências e melhores salvaguardas contra comportamentos anti-competitivos e a adopção de medidas anti-sociais relativamente à utilização do espectro.
Deveria ser formulada numa linguagem simples, para que pudesse ser entendida por todos, mais concretamente, não só pelos agricultores mas também pelos consumidores e contribuintes. O relatório representa um passo na direcção certa na medida em que desenvolve todos os esforços para tornar a agricultura mais dinâmica e competitiva, para que esta esteja preparada para responder aos objectivos estabelecidos pela Estratégia Europa 2020.
Deveria ser sempre fácil controlar a forma como as decisões foram elaboradas, quais os factores que as influenciaram e, acima de tudo, o modo como foram utilizados os recursos, o que significa, o dinheiro dos contribuintes. O Parlamento foi a primeira instituição europeia a criar um registo para os representantes de interesses, em 1996.
Deveria significar romper com centenas de regras.
Deveriam concentrar-se em convencer os tribunais a invocar o artigo 21.º da Lei de Extradição de 2003.
Deverá existir um só sítio, numa ou duas línguas, com critérios comuns, no qual todos estes beneficiários possam ser identificados e comparados.
Deverá recorrer-se a um processo transparente para informar as populações. O reforço da transparência implica que se definam claramente as responsabilidades das autoridades, bem como um sistema sólido e coordenado de informação às populações, a fim de ganhar e manter a sua confiança na gestão dos resíduos radioactivos resultantes do processo de produção de energia nuclear e de medicina nuclear.
Deverá ser criado um governo de transição, encarregado de preparar eleições. Por conseguinte, estão criadas as condições para a ONU reconhecer o Estado Palestiniano com as fronteiras de 1967, tendo como capital Jerusalém Oriental, a partir de Setembro.
Deverá ser dada especial atenção a medidas para eliminar, até 2020, as diferenças remuneratórias entre homens e mulheres, pois estas, actualmente, situam-se em cerca de 18%. Estou convencido de que as duas mais importantes iniciativas para o mercado de trabalho supranacional são o Quadro Europeu de Qualificações, redigido no contexto do processo de Copenhaga, e o Sistema Europeu de Transferência de Créditos para o Ensino e Formação Profissionais.
Deverá ser fácil controlar a forma como as decisões são elaboradas, quais as suas influências subjacentes e como são finalmente afectados os recursos, i.e., o dinheiro dos contribuintes.
Deverá ser tido em conta o facto de a Croácia se estar a preparar para aderir à União Europeia em 2012 ou 2013 e de representar, devido à sua localização geográfica, um bom ponto de transbordo para os traficantes de droga.
Deverá, assim, melhorar-se o quadro da governação económica, que deverá assentar numa maior apropriação nacional das normas e políticas adoptadas e num quadro de fiscalização mais sólido, a nível da União, das políticas económicas nacionais. O presente relatório, que apoiei, defende a necessidade de os Estados-Membros criarem sistemas contabilísticos que abranjam, de forma integral e consistente, todos os sectores da administração pública.
Deverá, assim, ser assegurado que as zonas urbanas de todas as regiões da UE, enquanto centros da actividade económica, inovação e emprego, possam beneficiar do apoio necessário e adequado para poderem enfrentar os enormes desafios que se lhes deparam como, por exemplo, a tendência para a sub-urbanização, a concentração da pobreza e do desemprego, o crescente congestionamento e poluição, etc.
Deverá, todavia, ser tida em conta a necessária adaptação dos sistemas estatísticos nacionais e os seus custos. A Comissão parece ter este facto em conta na sua proposta, ainda que apenas parcialmente, ao prever derrogações aos Estados-Membros quando for necessário efectuar adaptações de grande envergadura.
Deverão ainda ser introduzidas medidas administrativas que diminuam a burocracia aquando da elaboração das candidaturas pelos agricultores, por forma a facilitar o acesso aos fundos comunitários.
Deveríamos debater em conjunto o nível dos custos operacionais, bem como as sinergias que será possível realizar com o centro de informações. Um grande número de deputados participou no debate.
Deveríamos definir normas neste domínio, juntamente com a Agência Internacional de Energia Atómica (AIEA). Precisamos de normas que, muito simplesmente, garantam o mais elevado nível possível de segurança e que, em última análise, nos dêem a oportunidade de, tanto quanto possível, evitar colocar a população em risco.
Deveríamos estar a analisar que medidas da Agência Internacional de Energia Atómica (AIEA) estão à nossa disposição e quais podem ser incorporados na legislação da UE de uma forma juridicamente vinculativa. É claro que testes de stress pontuais não são suficientes.
Deveríamos estar a encorajar a adopção de novas tecnologias agrícolas e não a vilipendiá-la. Espero que os três últimos Invernos tenham convencido todos os presentes de que não estamos sob a ameaça do aquecimento global.
Deveríamos protegê-los por todos os meios possíveis contra a concorrência desleal de países como China, a Turquia, a Índia, o Vietname e o Paquistão, onde os trabalhadores são explorados a um muito baixo custo e onde não existem garantias mínimas em termos de respeito dos direitos sociais.
Deveríamos tratar uma política e instrumentos de gestão de crise nos países da zona euro e, outro tema, como evitar que a evolução persistentemente divergente das economias do euro destrua a moeda única.
Deveríamos, depois, criar uma lista negra destas empresas para servir de referência com base no princípio de "identificação e denúncia". Com a ajuda das autoridades nacionais de luta contra a fraude e das organizações afectadas, poderemos assim dispor de um instrumento simples e eficaz de dissuasão e prevenção. Por último, devemos punir severamente os que estão envolvidos neste sistema.
Devia haver um único objectivo para 2020: todos os jovens terem emprego.
Deviam ser as próprias autoridades públicas a tratar da distribuição ulterior da informação. Temos de ter em conta que, quando produzimos nova legislação na UE e ela é implementada nos Estados-Membros, muitas vezes estamos a impor ainda mais encargos às pequenas e médias empresas. Não basta, por conseguinte, reduzir pura e simplesmente a quantidade.
Devido a deficiências internas, corremos o risco de perder a nossa credibilidade enquanto defensores do respeito pelos direitos humanos fora da UE. Por esta razão, exorto a uma verdadeira protecção a nível da UE da liberdade de expressão e do pluralismo de imprensa.
Devido ao bloqueio ilegal de Israel, há 300 000 pessoas a viver no território com menos de um dólar por dia e a taxa de desemprego é superior a 40%. Catherine Ashton afirmou que a flotilha não era resposta adequada à situação que se vive em Gaza, mas a resposta da UE consiste em continuar a financiar, por meio da concessão de bolsas de investigação, as companhias de armamento israelitas que fabricam as armas que matam os civis palestinianos.
Devido à actual crise e às restrições drásticas da despesa pública, os Estados-Membros têm cada vez mais dificuldades em conseguir crescimento económico.
Devido à crise económica, a maioria dos países mediterrânicos não conseguirá fazer uso das ajudas de minimis. É um facto.
Devido à evolução demográfica, as pessoas trabalham até cada vez mais tarde na vida - seja porque podem e querem ou porque a tal são obrigados, mas cada um deve poder decidir por si. As pessoas vivem até atingirem idades mais avançadas e prosseguem as suas carreiras profissionais durante mais tempo e, para poderem desenvolver trabalho qualificado até terem mais idade, vão precisar também de realizar formação contínua.
Devido às discórdias entre os grupos, o meu grupo prefere concluir a primeira leitura esta semana.
Devido, nomeadamente, ao aumento das importações de produtos da pesca e da aquicultura para o mercado europeu, este sector tem vindo a ficar cada vez mais fragilizado. Não se trata apenas de uma questão de lucro económico. É do nosso interesse preservar esta actividade; ao fazê-lo, podemos desenvolver o nosso território e as nossas regiões costeiras, garantir a segurança alimentar da União Europeia e salvaguardar os empregos no sector.
Devo apenas lembrar que, em 15 de Outubro, o Conselho chegou a acordo quanto a um compromisso político. O resultado ficou muito próximo de uma minoria de bloqueio, e a luta prossegue agora aqui.
Devo assinalar que o mercado único não está ainda a funcionar no sector dos serviços, o que está a ter um impacto negativo nas actividades empresariais das PME na União Europeia.
Devo assinalar, contudo, que temos de identificar formas melhores de utilizar as receitas, obrigando a que os Estados-Membros invistam estes recursos na melhoria da Rede Transeuropeia de Transportes (RTE-T) e das infra-estruturas para reduzir a poluição. Essa é a única maneira de, no futuro, podermos dizer que a decisão de hoje teve resultados positivos.
Devo dizer igualmente que a Comissão demonstra uma grande insensibilidade ao fazer a proposta absurda e dispendiosa de colocar adidos culturais desnecessários num momento de dificuldades económicas a nível mundial.
Devo dizer que estou muito preocupado com a divergência nos debates políticos nacionais que temos ouvido nos últimos tempos e que também se reflectiram nesta Assembleia. Há sinais de fadiga política na Europa Central e do Norte relativamente ao apoio aos países em dificuldade; há, na Europa do Sul, uma fadiga relativamente à realização das reformas necessárias.
Devo dizer que me choca verdadeiramente ver o país que inventou a democracia a ser ameaçado por si e pelo cada vez mais abominável Fundo Monetário Internacional, e o seu povo a ser compelido a aceitar este pacote de austeridade. Têm de aceitar cortes na economia que levarão a uma depressão económica generalizada.
Devo dizer que não há um único membro na comissão que se caracterize pela atitude de "no meu quintal não". Não somos a favor da gestão irresponsável e queremos que os resíduos radioactivos sejam eliminados em condições de segurança. Por outro lado, sabemos que há excepções em que a exportação é permitida.
Devo dizer que não me agradam os ataques à UE ou a Bruxelas, nem os ataques aos Estados-Membros, porque isso diminui a importância da despesa que temos nos nossos países: cuidados de saúde, segurança social, pensões, educação. Não se trata de um conflito entre a UE e os Estados-Membros.
Devo dizer que perdemos a oportunidade de dar um passo em frente, que condenámos a indústria agro-alimentar a conviver com uma legislação obsoleta, e que colocámos travões no progresso tecnológico europeu que tanto defendemos em teoria.
Devo dizer que tanto o relatório de avaliação como o parecer do próprio relator são positivos, e que devemos agradecer-lhes, embora, ao mesmo tempo, também tenhamos de manifestar a nossa exasperação. Exasperação pela forma como alguns deputados europeus, de países que têm eles próprios problemas com a imigração ilegal e com a corrupção, olham hoje para a Roménia e para a Bulgária. A Bulgária e a Roménia são Estados-Membros de pleno direito da União Europeia e a nossa atitude para com estes Estados deve ser a mesma que é adoptada em relação a qualquer outro Estado-Membro da UE.
Devo dizer, de forma muito clara, que não queremos uma segunda Iniciativa Europeia para a Democracia e os Direitos do Homem (IEDDH), pois trata-se de um mecanismo burocrático, lento, excessivamente complexo e apolítico.
Devo insistir na importância de uma aplicação equitativa do princípio do "poluidor-pagador", como também ficou comprovado na sequência da catástrofe no Japão. Embora os seus baixos custos tornem a energia nuclear atractiva, a segurança dos trabalhadores e das populações civis deverá ter primazia.
Devo realçar que só podemos fazer o que nos for possível fazer. A proposta de resolução apresentada pelo Grupo do Partido Popular Europeu (Democratas-Cristãos) promete mais do que podemos fazer.
Devo recordar que muitos de nós vivemos a experiência do comunismo e que, desde então, levámos a cabo progressos enormes e rápidos para nos prepararmos para a adesão à União Europeia.
Devo salientar a importância da política de coesão uma vez que passou a ser uma importante fonte de apoio na Europa para a investigação e inovação.
Devo salientar que não foi uma decisão isolada da Presidência designar este dossiê como a grande prioridade. A iniciativa da Comissão também foi apoiada pelos Chefes de Estado e de Governo dos 27 EstadosMembros.
Devo sublinhar a grande importância de que se reveste a necessidade de se reverem os mecanismos de monitorização das emissões e de os ter plenamente em conta no plano orçamental.
Devo sublinhar a importância que esta revisão legislativa assume para a revitalização e a estabilização da economia da União Europeia.
Devo também dizer que, neste momento, no rescaldo do acidente de Fukushima, o nosso trabalho tem sido extremamente difícil, e congratulo-me com o facto de, apesar destes tempos difíceis, o texto aprovado pela Comissão da Indústria, da Investigação e da Energia (ITRE) ter sido elaborado com a exigência adequada e que não nos tenhamos deixado levar por debates ideológicos.
Devo, contudo, lembrar que as regras europeias devem ser iguais para todos os Estados-Membros e não podem ser alteradas durante o jogo, porque isso representaria um acto de discriminação para com os cidadãos romenos.
Devo, todavia, referir que, desde o início, muitas das questões relacionadas com estes Estados-Membros têm sido discutidas fora do formato regular do Ecofin, em função das suas características específicas enquanto membros da zona euro. O Presidente do Eurogrupo estaria mais habilitado do que eu a prestar informação pormenorizada sobre muitos destes pontos.
Devíamos certificar-nos de que há uma ligação directa entre o preço do peixe e o que os consumidores por ele pagam, mas, pura e simplesmente, subsidiar práticas que se revelam insustentáveis não é forma de reduzir a sobrepesca, responsável número um pelos problemas económicos. Há um mês a Senhora Comissária disse ao comité do Parlamento, quando o senhor deputado Cadec lhe pôs esta questão, que não era apologista da concessão de subsídios para compensar as despesas extra causadas pela subida do preço do combustível.
Devíamos estar a tomar medidas contra a clonagem apenas por razões ligadas à política europeia em matéria de bem-estar animal, Senhor Comissário Dalli, e esperamos que prepare um regulamento tão depressa quanto possível. É necessário agir.
Devíamos falar das questões dos conflitos pendentes na Moldávia, na Geórgia e em Nagorno-Kabarakh. A actividade russa nessas regiões está a impossibilitar a estabilização e uma solução pacífica.
Devíamos recomendar aos réus que cooperem com os órgãos de investigação. Não temos qualquer direito de exercer pressão sobre o sistema judicial da Ucrânia, uma vez que tal pode ser qualificado como interferência nos assuntos internos.
Devíamos também desenvolver outras possíveis fontes de energia, como de gás de xisto, por exemplo, que proporciona muitas oportunidades de obter energia sem expandir desnecessariamente o sector da energia nuclear.
Devíamos tentar ajudar a nossa própria população e, pela mesma medida, ajudar os outros.
Dezassete capitães na Europa com outros tantos imediatos, dezassete orçamentos, dezassete mercados obrigacionistas, para uma moeda comum. A moeda comum não pode continuar assim.
Dezenas de jornalistas encontram-se detidos nas prisões do país; além disso, a Turquia prossegue a ocupação militar de metade da ilha de Chipre, onde mantém 40 000 soldados estacionados, em violação dos direitos dos cipriotas gregos e turcos. E é aqui que faço um apelo à Senhora Baronesa Ashton para que descubra rapidamente, em Chipre, aquilo que só tardiamente descobrimos na Península Arábica.
Diferentemente do projecto de relatório, já não requeremos agora uma redução do co-financiamento, mas, e este é o aspecto que gostaria de referir, também não requeremos um aumento. O relatório também já não inclui a nossa proposta de fusão do Fundo Europeu de Ajustamento à Globalização com o Fundo Social Europeu.
Diga-se, a este propósito, que os Estados-Membros que celebrem acordos com países terceiros devem garantir que a sua posição está em conformidade com o modelo social europeu.
Digo isto porque - e passo ao meu segundo conjunto de observações - se, na revisão do Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento, o nosso único objectivo for o tipo de governação que satisfaz as agências de notação, perderemos uma oportunidade importante na história da nossa união económica e monetária. A história pede-nos hoje que tenhamos uma visão muito mais global e analisemos atentamente os motivos pelos quais esta governação económica está a ser criada.
Digo isto porque somos contra todas e quaisquer violações dos direitos humanos fundamentais, sempre e onde quer que elas ocorram.
Digo muitas vezes quando visito estes países que mais importante do que eleger um governo é o direito a poder derrubar um governo. A democracia é poder despedir-se tal como se dá as boas-vindas, e isso é importante: é fundamental saber que se tem o direito de utilizar as urnas, uma, duas, três, quatro vezes, para mudar o governo, para exigir do governo, e isso só se pode fazer quando se aprofunda e consolida a democracia. É por esta razão que o que aconteceu na Costa do Marfim é tão importante: ver o Presidente Ouattara tomar finalmente posse, e o papel que desempenhámos foi significativo para apoiar esse processo. É por esta razão que nos congratulamos por constatar que as eleições na Nigéria decorrem com normalidade e que Goodluck Jonathan é agora nomeado de forma adequada. É bom ver a democracia começar a crescer e a consolidar-se, e é isso que devemos apoiar.
Digo-vos com toda a sinceridade - se existem bactérias perigosas num pepino ou numa alface que não provocam a morte, isso é uma coisa boa mas, em minha opinião, não chega para justificar um processo de indemnização. Os pepinos de Espanha e de outros países continham efectivamente a bactéria EHEC. Não foram essas bactérias que causaram o surto, mas demora algum tempo descobrir isso.
Dimensão externa da política social, promoção das normas laborais e sociais e a responsabilidade social das empresas europeias (
Dir-vos-ei igualmente se não conseguirmos chegar a um acordo entre a Comissão e o ENSREG, altura em que podemos devolver o mandato ao Conselho Europeu. Não verão a minha assinatura numa versão simplificada do teste de stress.
Diria ao meu colega Martin Schulz que também tenho algumas interrogações relativamente às agências de notação e ao papel que estão a desempenhar na crise actual, mas tentemos encontrar os erros e as fontes da crise nas nossas próprias fileiras e talvez não fora da União Europeia e das suas instituições.
Diria apenas que o nosso papel é ouvir as crescentes preocupações - o que é quase um eufemismo - existentes em vários Estados-Membros relacionadas com as reformas realizadas em nome do processo de Bolonha. Não podemos sacrificar os nossos jovens e, nesta matéria, as palavras não bastam.
Diria que estamos a assistir a um aparatoso trambolhão político.
Discordando desta orientação, reconhecemos todavia que há neste domínio alterações importantes a levar a cabo.
Discordo de tal análise. O primeiro - e principal - objectivo da nossa estratégia tem sido prevenir a repetição de uma paragem cardíaca dos mercados como a que ocorreu após a falência do Lehman Brothers em Setembro de 2008 e que acabou por originar uma crise financeira e uma recessão económica a nível mundial. É o que temos feito, protegendo assim a recuperação em curso da economia real na Europa.
Discordo do relator, senhor deputado Coelho, na medida em que a adesão da Bulgária e da Roménia ao espaço Schengen não pode concretizar-se a curto prazo devido a deficiências nos domínios do equipamento, do desempenho dos controlos de fronteira, da formação de pessoal e da obrigação de intercâmbio de informações.
Discutimos hoje um relatório do painel de peritos do Secretário-Geral sobre a responsabilização no Sri Lanka.
Dispomos agora de uma definição do caso da UE, o que permitirá aos Estados-Membros adoptar a mesma abordagem comum na investigação do surto.
Dispomos da diplomacia europeia comum, que deve ser um instrumento eficaz da acção externa da União Europeia, porque não é possível resolver os problemas no interior da União Europeia hoje se não começarmos seriamente a resolver os problemas fora da União Europeia. A União Europeia deve ter mais força política, e não unicamente força económica.
Dispomos de um mecanismo financeiro para melhorar a gestão destes fluxos a nível europeu e fortalecer a solidariedade entre Estados-Membros.
Dispomos hoje da nossa última ou, na verdade, única oportunidade de influenciar antecipadamente a reforma do Estatuto.
Disponibilizando acesso às informações relevantes, estabelecendo um diálogo construtivo e tendo em conta a opinião do Parlamento, o Conselho não só demonstrará a sua boa vontade em termos de cooperação, mas também enviará uma mensagem poderosa sobre um dos guardiães dos valores europeus e sobre cooperação e parceria transparentes.
Dispor de recursos financeiros adequados é crucial para responder aos desafios em matéria de segurança alimentar, protecção ambiental, alterações climáticas e equilibro territorial da UE após o seu alargamento a leste. O relatório do senhor deputado Deß apela também ao desenvolvimento de uma política de qualidade alimentar com indicações geográficas (designações de origem protegida (DOP) e indicações geográficas protegidas (IGP), uma medida necessária se quisermos garantir a autenticidade das especialidades alimentares locais e regionais.
Disposições transitórias para os acordos bilaterais de investimento entre os Estados-Membros e os países terceiros (debate) 
Disse ontem ao Ministro Moallem, o Ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros da Síria, que deve permitir o acesso imediato e livre ao apoio humanitário e aos meios de comunicação social. Só assim é que os seus pedidos de apoio para protestos pacíficos podem receber resposta.
Disse que esse mecanismo deve ter acesso ao mercado secundário e, principalmente, que a sua intervenção pode assumir a forma de operações de swap com os seus títulos com classificação AAA, a preço de desconto.
Dissemo-lo então e dissemos repetidamente que os testes de resistência do sector bancário têm de ser credíveis, robustos e transparentes.
Ditar reformas educativas aos Estados-Membros ultrapassa as competências da UE, e devemos zelar por que isso não aconteça.
Dito isto, considero que as questões abordadas pelos senhores deputados Jean-Pierre Audy e Graça Carvalho - sobre as quais me pronunciarei noutras intervenções - são largamente dignas de nota.
Dito isto, e embora não directamente relacionado com esta medida, gostaria ainda de sublinhar a importância da manutenção do status quo no que diz respeito às actuais regras da OMC, em especial no que diz respeito ao mercado mundial de Têxteis e Vestuário (T&V) e muito concretamente a alterações às regras para a importação de produtos de T&V para a União Europeia, numa altura de forte contracção económica em diversos Estados-Membros.
Dito isto, o que é que terá de acontecer antes de se melhorarem os controlos ex-ante? Como poderemos assegurar uma melhoria da gestão das organizações de execução? O que irá a Comissão fazer para reforçar as capacidade dos países e das organizações regionais beneficiários e o que é necessário para que isso aconteça? Futuramente, a política de desenvolvimento da UE deverá despender mais em fundos que ofereçam acesso a serviços financeiros, ou seja, fundos de microfinanciamento. Há pessoas com sonhos e competências suficientes nos países pobres. Há que dar a essas pessoas a oportunidade de construírem as suas próprias vidas com pequenos empréstimos. O FED também deveria contribuir para esse objectivo.
Dito isto, penso que foi uma discussão útil, pois, onde há corrupção, há um corrupto, mas há igualmente alguém que o corrompe, por isso, de certa maneira, os membros do G8 foram também objecto de escrutínio quando discutimos o problema da África.
Dito isto, também deveria ser referido que haverá um retorno de alguns destes investimentos, por exemplo, sob a forma de poupança nas despesas com petróleo.
Dito isto, à luz da pressão acrescida em algumas fronteiras externas e dos apelos dirigidos aos Estados-Membros para reforçarem o sistema de regras de Schengen, o Conselho tem de ponderar como se pode continuar a garantir o princípio da livre circulação e, simultaneamente, a necessidade dos cidadãos de manutenção de um nível elevado de segurança interna.
Diz no princípio da carta enviada pela empresa enganosa que a informação é gratuita.
Diz-se também muitas vezes que devemos aceitar migrantes políticos, mas fechar as portas da Europa aos migrantes económicos.
Dizemos ao regime que mude de rumo, e que o faça já.
Dizendo respeito a uma declaração efectuada em 2004, muito antes de ter sido eleita deputada ao Parlamento. A relatora também não encontrou indícios de fumus persecutionis, ou seja, uma suspeita suficientemente grave e precisa de que o processo foi movido com a intenção de causar danos políticos à deputada.
Dizer que a imunidade de um deputado europeu deve ser levantada porque os comentários que lhe são censurados não foram feitos no âmbito da sua actividade parlamentar é um disparate absoluto do ponto de vista jurídico.
Do lado do Japão, a preferência, claramente expressa, vai no sentido de se dar início às negociações sobre um acordo de comércio livre que inclua preferências pautais.
Do mesmo modo, a Rússia levou a efeito manobras militares provocatórias na proximidade dos Estados Bálticos, os quais manifestaram a sua preocupação sobre a transacção que referi.
Do mesmo modo, há uma enorme necessidade de informação a nível comparável em toda uma ampla série de questões relacionadas com a silvicultura, como, por exemplo, informação e tendências em matéria de emprego, reservas, biomassa, incêndios, solos e carbono das florestas, bem como protecção da saúde florestal, da biodiversidade e das águas, pondo todas as Instituições grande ênfase em encontrar recursos para o conseguir.
Do meu ponto de vista, era importante evitar instituir um novo sistema de pagamentos adicionais que conduzisse a mais controlo e a sistemas de sanção para a dimensão ecológica.
Do nosso ponto de vista, a vossa abordagem e a estratégia da maioria de direita do Conselho constituem a maior ameaça ao próprio futuro da ideia europeia porque estão a destruir o sentimento de pertença a uma comunidade e os conceitos de solidariedade e coesão.
Do nosso ponto de vista, uma agenda urbana deve dar prioridade a uma melhor distribuição da população no território de alguns países, nomeadamente em Portugal, aliviando as cidades através da valorização do mundo rural e da actividade agrícola devidamente remunerada, distribuindo pelo seu território a actividade produtiva, valorizando serviços públicos de qualidade nos meios rurais e nas cidades, combatendo o desemprego e defendendo o emprego com direitos, valorizando salários e pensões e combatendo a pobreza.
Do ponto de vista das alterações climáticas, é extremamente importante garantir a segurança das florestas, uma vez que elas se encontram cada vez mais ameaçadas por catástrofes naturais, particularmente por incêndios ou grande diversidade de doenças de árvores. Não podemos esquecer o papel excepcional das florestas em assegurar o equilíbrio e a diversidade biológicos, e que elas constituem um elo precioso no funcionamento adequado da economia, não apenas na produção de madeira, mas também em relação a outros produtos e serviços que constituem um bem público comum.
Do ponto de vista do Parlamento Europeu, a questão mais importante são as barreiras não pautais, assunto que tem sido abordado inúmeras vezes em reuniões da Comissão do Comércio Internacional. O problema não são os direitos aduaneiros mas sim os incontáveis regulamentos restritivos e obstáculos que se deparam às empresas da UE que procuram ter acesso ao mercado japonês. Sou favorável a uma maior cooperação entre a União Europeia e o Japão, mas considero que a prioridade deve ser a eliminação destas barreiras não tarifárias que limitam o acesso dos produtos da UE ao mercado japonês.
Do ponto de vista económico, enquanto se mantiver esta situação os agricultores continuarão a ser os mais prejudicados, mesmo se os seus produtos são perfeitamente seguros.
Do ponto de vista político e em matéria de liberdades cívicas, testemunhamos o início dos julgamentos dos principais opositores de Alexander Lukashenko nas últimas eleições presidenciais, e vemos os procedimentos escandalosos aplicados nestes julgamentos.
Do que precisamos é de um orçamento para os próximos anos que reflicta as ambições da UE, nomeadamente as dos Chefes de Estado ou de Governo, respondendo, ao mesmo tempo, às expectativas dos nossos cidadãos. O que pode parecer um debate bastante inócuo sobre casas decimais irá, na verdade, ditar a direcção da União Europeia nos próximos dez anos.
Do relatório saliento ainda o enfoque no respeito pela preservação/promoção da riqueza linguística/cultural de cada um dos Estados-Membros, a importância da difusão dos valores culturais europeus como forma de promoção dos direitos fundamentais, da democracia e da boa governação e, finalmente, a importância da existência de um Adido cultural em cada uma das representações externas da UE.
Do seu financiamento, mais de 50% ainda está por executar, a revisão intercalar do actual programa-quadro é, assim, importante para que durante a segunda parte da sua vigência este contribua eficazmente para a recuperação da economia europeia.
Dois importantes pontos se evidenciam neste relatório: a simplificação e a transparência do direito comunitário.
Donde esta ideia de análise abrangente e completa da actual utilização do espectro pelo conjunto das partes envolvidas, incluindo as que o deputado Giles Chichester acaba de salientar, a saber, por exemplo, os serviços de protecção civil, ou mesmo os militares.
Dos objectivos fundamentais da União Europeia faz parte a defesa da paz, dos direitos humanos e da democracia. A promoção dos nossos valores tem de assentar numa estratégia ambiciosa de acção externa e de diplomacia. O Tratado de Lisboa conferiu uma voz à União por intermédio da Alta Representante da União para os Negócios Estrangeiros e a Política de Segurança/Vice-Presidente da Comissão Europeia. A nossa PESC não pode tolerar divisões. Este voto é, pois, um pedido de coordenação melhorada entre todas as instituições: o Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa, a Comissão Europeia, os Estados-Membros e, claro, o Parlamento Europeu.
Dou agora a palavra ao Senhor Ministro Zsolt László Becsey, que falará em nome do Conselho.
Dou o meu apoio total ao relatório sobre a "União da Inovação” porque penso que nos permitirá derrubar as barreiras que entravam o pensamento inovador na União Europeia.
Dou o meu total apoio a esta posição. Esperamos vê-la incluída nas propostas legislativas do senhor Comissário.
Dou o meu voto a esta iniciativa, lamentando, porém, o facto de a mesma não ir ter quaisquer repercussões concretas.
Dublin está, naturalmente, relacionado com isto, mas é um processo paralelo, que faz parte das negociações sobre o pacote de asilo, actualmente em curso entre o Parlamento e o Conselho. A Comissão propôs a manutenção da responsabilidade do primeiro país de asilo no Regulamento Dublin, mas também a reintrodução de um mecanismo de emergência, que permita suspender esse mecanismo em circunstâncias especiais.
Durante a campanha eleitoral, o meu partido exigiu o registo obrigatório dos representantes dos grupos de pressão num registo comum a todas as instituições da UE. Pedimos também que fossem fornecidas informações sobre as questões específicas tratadas pelos representantes dos grupos de pressão. O registo deve incluir informações financeiras, incluindo as despesas com as suas actividades e por quem são estas financiadas. É necessário um código de conduta para a actividade de lobbying.
Durante a crise dos mercados asiáticos veio a apurar-se que a regulação constitui uma precaução judiciosa.
Durante a terceira fase, tencionamos formar a nossa própria visão da situação, proceder à nossa própria avaliação e tirar as nossas próprias conclusões a nível europeu. Nós permaneceremos sentados na nossa torre de marfim, nem aceitaremos ingenuamente os resultados fornecidos pelas autoridades nacionais.
Durante a votação do relatório parlamentar sobre a União da Inovação, quis apoiar a alteração que rejeitava a ideia de controlar a inovação através da canalização para actividades inovadoras dos recursos dos Fundos Estruturais e de determinadas rubricas dos fundos da Política Agrícola Comum.
Durante as negociações com o Conselho de Ministros da UE, o PE incluiu novas disposições no regulamento, como as que exigem a indicação de materiais derivados de animais nos produtos têxteis e a realização de um estudo para determinar se existe um nexo de causalidade entre as reacções alérgicas e as substâncias químicas utilizadas nos produtos têxteis.
Durante as negociações sobre o pacote mais alargado de propostas legislativas, o "pacote de seis medidas”, foram feitas sugestões de melhoria desta directiva do Conselho, muitas delas pelo Banco Central Europeu e por membros desta Assembleia. O Conselho procurou de boa-fé, e sempre que adequado, melhorar a directiva, bem como melhorar a transparência, mantendo embora uma atitude cautelosa em relação a questões sensíveis relacionadas com as constituições nacionais.
Durante as recentes apresentações em Bruxelas dos projectos de investimento South Stream, ficou claro que a Rússia e a Gazprom pretendem privilégios e um estatuto especial. Não podemos concordar com isso.
Durante este processo, não disfarcei o meu próprio cepticismo relativamente à introdução da etiquetagem de origem.
Durante muitos anos, o PIB foi o principal índice de avaliação económica, mas as suas insuficiências são cada vez mais evidentes quando se trata de avaliar o progresso social ou ambiental.
Durante o debate de Janeiro sobre a situação na Tunísia e no Egipto e a liberdade de expressão religiosa, mencionei a trágica situação dos cristãos nos países árabes, especialmente os cristãos egípcios coptas, que têm vindo a ser perseguidos.
Durante o debate um colega nosso disse que deixar entrar a Roménia e a Bulgária seria uma decisão infantil. Não estou nada de acordo.
Durante o fim-de-semana e na segunda-feira à noite, o Conselho tentou obter um compromisso final relativamente ao problema dos votos no Conselho Europeu.
Durante o seu desenvolvimento, em Julho de 2009, foram adoptadas orientações propostas pela Comissão em matéria de ajudas de Estado, que estabeleciam que os bancos que careciam de ajuda financeira para enfrentar a crise deveriam submeter-se também a testes de esforço. Em 1 de Outubro de 2009, os resultados agregados foram enviados ao Conselho ECOFIN, que, em 2 de Dezembro desse ano, solicitou ao CEBS que lhe fornecesse informação sobre a resistência do sistema bancário, e, para o efeito, seriam levados a cabo novos testes de esforço.
Durante o último ano, especialmente no contexto da resposta à catástrofe do Haiti, às inundações no Paquistão e, presentemente, na resposta à Líbia, desenvolvemos relações de trabalho muito fortes e eficazes com o Estado-Maior da União Europeia do Serviço Europeu de Acção Externa, de tal forma que neste momento o Estado-Maior da União Europeia designa agentes de ligação como parte da nossa operação humanitária, para assim planificarmos e executarmos como se fôssemos uma única entidade.
Durante os próximos anos, temos de fazer uso da condicionalidade.
Durante os últimos meses, a UE e os Estados-Membros disponibilizaram cerca de 96 milhões de euros em ajuda humanitária de emergência e estamos empenhados em prosseguir o apoio à medida que a situação assim o exigir.
Durante todo este período, o Grupo de Avaliação de Schengen efectuou inspecções e controlos sistemáticos que demonstraram agora que ambos os países estão suficientemente preparados para aplicar satisfatoriamente as disposições do acervo de Schengen.
Durante todo este período, os factores ambientais têm de ser atentamente acompanhados enquanto os resíduos estiverem a ser armazenados, e também durante o seu transporte e o transporte dos produtos obtidos com a reciclagem do combustível irradiado.
Durante uma viagem, cada atuneiro cercador embarca pelo menos dois marinheiros locais, designados pelo agente do navio, de acordo com o armador, de entre os nomes constantes de uma lista apresentada pela autoridade competente das Seicheles.
Dá a impressão de que o euro está em crise porque determinados Estados-Membros são incapazes de gerir os seus assuntos de forma sensata e assumiram níveis de dívida demasiado elevados. A Irlanda e Portugal, porém, geriram os seus assuntos de forma disciplinada e viram-se mergulhados numa crise que não é da sua responsabilidade.
E a Hungria, que foi o primeiro país do mundo a ser objecto de uma acção coordenada para reinstalação dos seus refugiados em 1956, tem responsabilidades muito particulares, responsabilidades históricas para agir também nesta crise de refugiados. Não nos podemos queixar de falta de fundos nesta matéria.
E a posição deste Parlamento relativamente a essa questão não tem o apoio de muitos dos membros do meu grupo. Não posso concordar com as alterações do Parlamento ao texto do Conselho sobre os desequilíbrios macroeconómicos e gostaria de ver, nas próximas semanas, uma maior clareza nas diferentes posições dos EstadosMembros da área do euro e fora dela.
E aqui se tornam mais patentes as suas contradições: ao caucionar os objectivos da chamada Estratégia Europa 2020, acaba por defender o caminho que conduz aos problemas que identifica, ou seja, a precariedade laboral dos jovens e o desemprego.
E chegamos assim ao fulcro do problema: a comunicação da Comissão. Em minha opinião, não foi muito clara. A Comunicação declara que, como último recurso em situações verdadeiramente críticas, pode vir a ser necessário introduzir um mecanismo - o que, na minha interpretação, significa um novo mecanismo - que permita uma reintrodução coordenada e temporária dos controlos.
E como procurámos alcançar tal objectivo? Por um lado, empenhámo-nos em manter um diálogo permanente com ambos os países, observando os seus esforços e tentando ajudá-los a encontrar formas de obter um maior reconhecimento dos seus esforços. Por outro lado, mantivemos um contacto permanente com os países que manifestaram dúvidas acerca da adesão da Roménia e da Bulgária.
E finalmente, Senhor Comissário, a protecção contra os ciberataques e os ataques terroristas tem de ser estabelecida em todas as políticas sectoriais da União Europeia onde possam ocorrer emissões transfronteiriças de materiais perigosos. O Governo húngaro em exercício reprovou os testes de stress que o senhor prevê, Senhor Comissário, porque impediu repetidamente, nos últimos sete anos, a construção da instalação de radar da NATO, que providenciaria uma protecção maior do que a actual contra ataques com aeronaves à central nuclear de Paks.
E no entanto, fruto das revoluções árabes, eis que se abre diante de si um espaço político extraordinário, um espaço em que o papel da diplomacia europeia tem de ser definido de forma inequívoca, pois que, para lá das características específicas de cada país, é verdade que tudo está interligado.
E que instrumentos são esses? A União Europeia. A União Europeia é uma obra em curso, uma obra inacabada, que só não conseguimos dar por terminada precisamente devido à nossa fraqueza e ao nosso medo.
E quero aproveitar só para dizer uma coisa. A maioria de dois terços, muitas vezes aqui convocada, que aliás vem de 50 % de votos e não de dois terços dos votos expressos dos cidadãos húngaros - são dois terços dos deputados, mas apenas 50 % dos votos -, serve para uma coisa em todo o lado, para que a Constituição seja objecto de um grande consenso social. O poder húngaro, neste momento, utilizou a maioria dos dois terços exactamente para o contrário: excluir a oposição e fazer com que a Constituição fosse objecto de um grande dissenso na sociedade.
E sabemos porquê: uma das principais razões é a enorme importância atribuída à aprendizagem durante a primeira infância. A intervenção na primeira infância pode ser decisiva para as oportunidades que a criança terá ao longo da vida, não só no seu percurso escolar, mas também numa fase mais tardia.
E também considero que uma nova convenção e recomendação da OIT, se possível a aprovar na 7.ª Conferência Internacional do Trabalho, poderia ser uma ajuda importante. E, nesse sentido, sem dúvida que o papel da Comissão, do Sr. Comissário, no incentivo aos Estados-Membros, mas também como motivador de maior atenção aos conteúdos exactos desta convenção, pode ter uma grande importância.
E também vamos prosseguir com estas negociações e continuar a luta, pelo que ele pode contar connosco.
E é de facto vital manter e reforçar a posição económica e competitiva da Europa e maximizar o seu impacto social e cultural através do desenvolvimento de serviços inovadores em benefício dos cidadãos. E eu gostaria de acrescentar o termo impacto "cultural", pois é algo de muito importante.
E, claro, a África! mencionei dois países, mas poderíamos falar de muitos mais, sobretudo no que se refere aos acontecimentos que tiveram novamente lugar hoje no Sudão e à importância de assegurar que o Sudão do Sul nasce com todas as possibilidades de sucesso
E, em relação a Schengen, eu quero dizer uma coisa. A resposta às suspensões ad hoc de Schengen, às suspensões unilaterais de Schengen, não pode ser nunca uma suspensão sistémica comunitária de Schengen.
E, por isso, o que se impunha era que a Comissão Europeia tivesse uma posição firme para alterar esta situação para por fim a paraísos fiscais, para controlar os mercados financeiros, para por fim ao agravamento das desigualdades e da exploração.
E, por último, a Comissão tem em vista uma política de imigração. Trabalhem connosco. Não sejam tímidos: sejam corajosos e certifiquem-se de que, quando corrigirmos Schengen, também corrigiremos a política de imigração comum e ficaremos com algo de que poderemos orgulhar-nos.
Efectivamente, a Europa encontra-se atrasada em relação aos Estados Unidos e está a ser alcançada muito rapidamente pelos países emergentes; portanto, deve repor urgentemente a inovação na primeira linha do seu modelo social. O relatório do deputado Audy aproveita os ensinamentos retirados da primeira parte do Sétimo Programa-Quadro (PQ7) em matéria de investigação. A fim de cumprir os objectivos da Estratégia Europa 2020, propõe que a investigação apoiada pelo PQ7 se centre na resolução dos problemas mais prementes dos sectores identificados no capítulo "Cooperação”: saúde, alimentação e biotecnologia, TIC, nanociências e nanotecnologias, energia, Plano SET e utilização de biogás, ambiente, transportes sustentáveis, ciências económicas, sociais e humanas, espaço e segurança. Votei a favor do relatório porque não só faz uma avaliação da situação, como define objectivos ambiciosos para a União, que correspondem às expectativas dos cidadãos europeus.
Efectivamente, a convergência regulamentar pode ser muito útil para promover condições de concorrência equitativas, particularmente no que se refere a subvenções públicas e a normas sociais e ambientais. É lamentável que o Conselho ainda não tenha atribuído à Comissão um mandato para encetar negociações sobre um acordo global em matéria de transportes aéreos com parceiros comerciais importantes como a República Popular da China e a Índia, apesar de a proposta datar de 2005. O crescimento económico destas regiões aumenta o valor desses acordos.
Efectivamente, esta modificação deve ter por objectivo sublinhar o carácter excepcional deste processo e justifica-se também face ao fardo administrativo e técnico que tal processo implica.
Efectivamente, estes estados têm normalmente uma maior necessidade de notas e moedas de euro durante a preparação para a introdução da moeda única nos seus territórios, para se poderem envolver de forma rápida e completa no comércio comunitário e nele participar de forma plena.
Efectivamente, o crime de delito comum é hoje cometido também através da Internet, porque esta é um instrumento útil, mas existem também novos tipos de crime que são facilitados pela Internet, como a falsificação de identidades ou o saque de contas bancárias ou actividades similares.
Efectivamente, optar por uma abordagem de "lista negativa” (uma lista que exclui certos serviços públicos do processo de liberalização) e não pela abordagem de "lista positiva” (isentando os serviços públicos da liberalização, excepto os que constam da lista), poderemos acabar por fragilizar os serviços públicos. A resolução considera que a Comissão Europeia deve abandonar a abordagem adoptada.
Efectivamente, para que este sistema seja plenamente eficaz em matéria de transportes, o seu alcance tem de ir para além das fronteiras da Europa e incluir os nossos vizinhos mais próximos.
Efectivamente, quando referimos, com alguma hesitação, que os trabalhadores domésticos representam entre 5% a 9% de todos os trabalhadores, isso significa que não conhecemos a realidade do trabalho doméstico. O rácio é de 1:2. Por conseguinte, insto a que as nossas disposições nos permitam, a nível europeu, obter um melhor entendimento da realidade do trabalho doméstico, a fim de lhe podermos conceder mais garantias.
Efectivamente, uma das dificuldades apontadas é a complexidade e o peso dos procedimentos administrativos, que levam os investigadores que procuram financiamento europeu a optarem antes pelo financiamento nacional, o que torna a Europa impopular em matéria de investigação. É igualmente muito importante que as políticas de investigação e desenvolvimento sejam territorializadas para que a investigação seja distribuída harmoniosamente por todas as universidades. A excelência frequentemente encontrada em zonas urbanas pode ser assegurada através do reforço de ligações virtuais, nomeadamente por intermédio da vídeoconferência permanente e de uma ligação inteligente entre os centros de investigação territorializados e os centros de excelência.
Eis a razão por que estamos a adaptar este programa político, não só para libertar a banda dos 800 MHz, mas também para libertar bandas adicionais até pelo menos aos 1 200 MHz até 2015.
Eis a razão por que o nosso modus operandi deve estar sempre aberto ao debate e por que devemos questionar-nos.
Eis algumas das acções que concretizámos num lapso de tempo muito curto.
Eis o objectivo essencial deste relatório, o qual considero por isso extraordinariamente adequado.
Ela custa também muito dinheiro aos nossos agricultores e mina de forma perigosa a confiança dos consumidores nos nossos produtos agrícolas e na nossa indústria agro-industrial, que continuam a ser, sem sombra de dúvida, os mais seguros e os mais rigorosamente controlados do mundo.
Ela deve garantir o desenvolvimento de infra-estruturas e corrigir os desequilíbrios de desenvolvimento entre regiões individuais. A crise financeira exacerbou ainda mais as diferenças regionais. A Europa enfrenta um desemprego a grande escala.
Ela deverá ser um elemento-chave das políticas públicas em áreas como o ambiente, a água, a energia, os transportes, as telecomunicações, a saúde e a educação e ajudar a resolver problemas como a escassez e a eficiência do uso de recursos, a valorização e tratamento de resíduos, a qualidade e segurança alimentares, as mudanças demográficas, as novas epidemias, a conservação da natureza e da biodiversidade.
Ela espelha um antigo ditado irlandês, "um bom começo é metade do caminho", e pode ser realizada logo durante a primeira infância.
Ela integra as deliberações mais amplas que visam encontrar uma resposta global para um desafio global.
Ela não tem uma voz única e coerente, mas muitas vozes.
Ela pretende construir casas para a população; tem uma grande visão do que pode significar para o Egipto a construção de um milhão de casas em duas décadas.
Ela tornar-se-ia, assim, uma opção muito mais palpável e concreta para os agricultores se orientarem no sentido de fazerem algo em relação ao clima, à qualidade da água ou qualquer outra coisa, de modo a obtermos mais resultados dos subsídios que damos à agricultura.
Ela é a encarnação prática da afirmação de Robert Schuman: a Europa não se construirá de uma só vez ou através de uma integração global; far-se-á por meio de realizações concretas que criem, em primeiro lugar, uma solidariedade de facto.
Ela é desesperadamente necessária num momento em que enfrentamos numerosos desafios comuns que exigem respostas comuns neste período a que o senhor deputado Schulz chamou a era do espírito de Entsolidarisierung ("desmantelamento da solidariedade”).
Ela é uma candidata competente e experiente, que conquistou o respeito dos nossos parceiros da comunidade internacional. Não só tem um conhecimento muito bom da economia e dos mecanismos de decisão da UE, o que constitui um mérito nos dias que correm, como dispõe também de uma experiência muito sólida em matéria de governação económica global - por via do bem sucedido exercício da Presidência do G20, por exemplo.
Elas constituem um passo que vai permitir-nos assegurar a consistência das nossas políticas, que vai permitir-nos alcançar compromissos internacionais e o objectivo de uma economia europeia mais verde.
Elas demonstraram que estas Instituições não são apenas tertúlias, mas são também uma fonte de ajuda prática.
Elas encontram-se numa posição bastante delicada, entre as empresas de base e a criação de produtos culturais. É gratificante que, mesmo nas actuais circunstâncias, este sector seja um dos mais dinâmicos e inovadores da Europa.
Elas morrerão prematuramente porque a Europa deixará de utilizar energia nuclear e substitui-la-á por energia fóssil. A qualidade do ar será pior, o que aumentará a incidência de doenças cardiovasculares e ameaça a vida de quem sofre de asma. O verdadeiro assassino por trás do desastre de Fukushima é, portanto, o carvão, para onde se vira agora a Alemanha, por exemplo.
Elas necessitarão também de orçamentos próprios adicionais no próximo exercício.
Elas são as ferramentas de que dispomos para ajudar a Europa a atravessar a crise económica que actualmente enfrentamos.
Ele advoga novos recursos próprios, abrindo a porta a uma união fiscal e a um imposto sobre as transacções financeiras que deve ser estendido ao resto do mundo. A partir de 2020, o relatório propõe períodos de 5 anos (ou de 5+5 anos), que estão mais em sintonia com o mandato das instituições.
Ele compreendeu que este período decisivo para o futuro do Sul do Sudão representa também um teste de resistência para a União Europeia, e não só para a União Europeia.
Ele destruiu os valores morais das pessoas, as tradições, a solidariedade e a autoconfiança. Por que razão têm os meus compatriotas de continuar a ouvir a história de Moscovo segundo a qual, na realidade, não houve ocupação dos países bálticos, os países bálticos não foram ocupados em consequência do pacto de Hitler (Molotov-Ribbentrop) e os países bálticos escolheram o socialismo no Verão de 1940? Por que razão eu, assim como os meus compatriotas, temos de continuar a ouvir a história da "libertação" destes deportados, que eram os mais educados e as pessoas mais válidas nos Estados Bálticos? Por isso, peço à Comissão Europeia que proporcione o melhor apoio possível à investigação adequada dos crimes do regime comunista, exigida pelos Ministros da Justiça dos vários Estados-Membros, incluindo todos os Estados Bálticos, e termine esta tarefa incompleta de avaliação dos crimes de todos os regimes totalitários.
Ele dá uma panorâmica do papel estratégico que a UE deve desempenhar no exterior das suas fronteiras, nomeadamente no que se refere à contribuição para o desenvolvimento da democracia e ao respeito pelos direitos humanos.
Ele inclui a progressividade dos fundos públicos em função de considerações ligadas ao emprego e ao ambiente, o reconhecimento da agricultura como produtora de bens públicos e o conceito de agricultores activos.
Ele incorpora o essencial das medidas anti-sociais aplicadas noutros países, como a Grécia e a Irlanda, bem como as que constam do "Pacto para o Euro mais" imposto pelas potências europeias. A concretizar-se, ele agravará a situação nacional - com o agravamento da recessão económica, desemprego, pobreza, desigualdades sociais e da dependência nacional. A ser implementado, este autêntico programa de submissão, como o demonstra a situação noutros países, agravará mesmo as condições que, alegadamente, determinariam esta intervenção, ou seja: as dificuldades em fazer face aos insuportáveis custos crescentes da dívida pública.
Ele irá regular as transacções financeiras e dar-nos-á a oportunidade de definir políticas mais inteligentes.
Ele proporciona a melhor base possível para convencermos os nossos cidadãos no debate local e para iniciarmos negociações sérias com o Conselho, que, infelizmente, prima pela ausência no debate de hoje.
Ele referiu que, quando Henry Kissinger foi criticado pela postura isolacionista dos Estados Unidos, especificamente em relação à União Europeia, respondeu:"Não há nenhum ministro dos negócios estrangeiros, nem um número de telefone para onde possa ligar e falar com a Europa".
Ele terá alegadamente dito que se reuniu com David Cameron e persuadiu o Ministério da Saúde a considerar a sua proposta de um sistema de cheques para o Sistema Nacional de Saúde. Disto resultou recentemente um artigo sobre ele, escrito de boa fé, num jornal dominical nacional, o que lhe pode conferir mais falsa credibilidade para enganar os necessitados de cuidados médicos sérios.
Ele visa simplificar e aperfeiçoar o quadro regulamentar existente relativo à etiquetagem de produtos têxteis, encorajar a inovação no sector têxtil e do vestuário e o desenvolvimento e a aceitação de novas fibras.
Eles antecipam o futuro e prevêem a evolução da sociedade, porque vêem mais depressa e mais longe do que os políticos.
Eles deverão facultar mais informações acerca das características e origem dos produtos têxteis importados de países terceiros e vendidos na União Europeia, protegendo assim os consumidores de reivindicações de origem falsas, impróprias e enganadoras.
Eles entraram em incumprimento.
Eles necessitam de crescimento e investimento, e a União Europeia pode dar um contributo nesse sentido.
Eles podem também provocar reacções contraproducentes nos mercados e dar lugar a perturbações. Portanto, há que prestar atenção a essa questão e tomá-la seriamente em linha de conta.
Eles representam um valor acrescentado, não apenas para a indústria, mas igualmente para os transportes na Europa, e é por isso que os apoio inteiramente.
Eles também estão a introduzir o comércio de carbono agora; estão a descobrir exactamente como fazê-lo. Vão começar no dia 1 de Janeiro de 2015. A China está a levar a cabo enormes projectos-piloto de comércio de carbono.
Em 1 de Abril de 1987, a Comissão recomendou a codificação de todos os actos que tivessem, no máximo, dez alterações, de modo a que as disposições comunitárias fossem mais facilmente entendíveis.
Em 13 de Abril de 2011, apresentámos duas propostas legislativas em matéria de DPI, no âmbito da cooperação reforçada, o que reduzirá até 80% o custo das patentes.
Em 14 de Abril de 2011, a Comissão adoptou uma nova proposta de decisão sobre a mobilização do FEG a favor da Bélgica, a fim de apoiar a reintegração no mercado de trabalho de 2 834 trabalhadores despedidos da empresa principal General Motors Belgium e em quatro dos seus fornecedores que operam no sector automóvel na região de Antuérpia. A avaliação da Comissão baseou-se na análise de diversos aspectos: o nexo existente entre os despedimentos e mudanças estruturais importantes nos padrões do comércio mundial ou a crise financeira, o carácter imprevisto dos despedimentos em questão, a prova do número de despedimentos, a explicação do carácter imprevisto desses despedimentos, a identificação das empresas que procederam aos despedimentos e dos trabalhadores potenciais beneficiários de assistência, a descrição do território em causa e das suas autoridades e outras partes interessadas, o impacto dos despedimentos no emprego a nível local, regional ou nacional e o "pacote" coordenado de serviços personalizados a financiar.
Em 14 de Abril de 2011, a Comissão adoptou uma proposta de decisão sobre a mobilização do Fundo Europeu de Ajustamento à Globalização (FEG) a favor da Bélgica, a fim de apoiar a reintegração no mercado de trabalho de trabalhadores despedidos em consequência da crise económica e financeira mundial. O parecer hoje apresentado diz respeito a 2 834 casos de despedimento (todos potenciais beneficiários de assistência) na empresa principal General Motors Belgium e em quatro dos seus fornecedores que operam no sector automóvel. A candidatura preenche os critérios de elegibilidade definidos no Regulamento FEG, de acordo com a avaliação da Comissão, que recomenda à autoridade orçamental a sua aprovação. O Parlamento assumiu hoje uma posição favorável relativamente a esta matéria.
Em 14 de Junho de 1985, procedeu-se à assinatura do Acordo Schengen que, através da supressão dos controlos nas fronteiras internas dos países signatários e da criação de um espaço comum, veio possibilitar a livre circulação de pessoas e bens em todo o espaço da União Europeia (UE). Considerando que a Roménia e a Bulgária adoptaram o Acordo Schengen em 2007, que os documentos mostram que, do ponto de vista técnico, quer a Bulgária, quer a Roménia estão preparadas para a adesão à UE, que todos os capítulos da adesão foram concluídos em Março de 2011 e que o atraso na aprovação do novo sistema de avaliação de Schengen para minimizar os problemas existentes (receio do aumento da insegurança) não pode impedir a entrada destes países na UE, voto favoravelmente.
Em 14 de Junho de 2010, a Comissão publicou o seu Plano de Acção sobre Aplicações do Sistema Global de Navegação por Satélite (GNSS), contendo 24 recomendações de acção específicas. O Plano de Acção insere-se no contexto global de implantação geral dos sistemas globais de navegação por satélite e, em especial, de desenvolvimento e implantação do sistema europeu complementar de navegação geostacionário EGNOS, o precursor do sistema Galileo. O sector, na sua globalidade, tem experimentado uma enorme expansão desde a primeira disponibilização de serviços GPS a partir das instalações de satélite americanas em 2000. O valor estimado do mercado global era de 124 mil milhões de euros em 2008, projectando-se que atinja os 230 mil milhões de euros até 2025.
Em 18 de Maio, ocorrerão protestos em todo o mundo organizados por múltiplos grupos, incluindo a Campanha de Solidariedade Tamil, para assinalar o segundo aniversário desta guerra sangrenta. É ainda necessária uma luta unida dos povos cingalês e tamil para derrotar este regime e defender o direito à autodeterminação para os falantes de tamil.
Em 18 de Março, a Autoridade Bancária Europeia publicou um documento de síntese com a metodologia, e nós queremos saber, quando o Conselho Europeu de Março considerou que a informação devia ser publicada, que medidas...
Em 1963-64, a agitação civil e as subsequentes invasão e ocupação turcas de Chipre, em 1974, resultaram no desaparecimento de aproximadamente 2 000 cipriotas turcos e gregos. O seu destino é desconhecido e em 1981, foi fundado o Comité das Pessoas Desaparecidas, principalmente financiado pela UE. O trabalho que o comité tem desenvolvido nesta área trouxe a paz a muitas famílias mas com mais de mil e quinhentas pessoas ainda desaparecidas há muito mais trabalho a fazer.
Em 1990, o eminente professor americano Joseph Nye formulou, no seu livro Bound to Lead, o conceito de "poder suave” ("soft power”). O que significa? O "poder suave” é a capacidade de um actor internacional para influenciar outros recorrendo a meios não-coercivos, designadamente ao dinamismo cultural.
Em 1998, a União Europeia definiu a obrigatoriedade de as empresas importadoras efectuarem uma prova de origem dos produtos que constam da Secção XI da Nomenclatura Combinada, referidos no Anexo 1 ao Regulamento (CEE) n.º 3030/93 do Conselho, e que tenham sido produzidos em países terceiros.
Em 20 de Dezembro de 2010, a empresa do ramo automóvel General Motors Belgium, na sequência de ter sido obrigada a despedir 2 834 trabalhadores (empresa principal e quatro fornecedores), apresentou uma candidatura ao FEAG.
Em 2002, o Parlamento estónio declarou as deportações um crime contra humanidade.
Em 2005, a Organização Mundial de Comércio revogou as restrições relativas às importações com origem em Estados-Membros, e a União Europeia também deveria simplificar a legislação em vigor, com vista à criação de um enquadramento legislativo melhor e mais claro para as empresas, principalmente, no que diz respeito à simplificação das formalidades aduaneiras seguidas pelos importadores de determinados produtos têxteis introduzidos em livre prática na Comunidade.
Em 2005, a República da Croácia, solicitou a sua participação nas actividades do OEDT. A República da Croácia participará no programa de trabalho do Observatório, respeitará as obrigações estabelecidas no regulamento, disporá de uma ligação à Rede Europeia de Informação sobre a Droga e a Toxicodependência (REITOX) e partilhará dados com o OEDT, sujeitos às exigências, em matéria de protecção de dados, previstas na legislação da União e nas legislações nacionais. A República da Croácia contribuirá financeiramente para a União, a fim de cobrir os custos da sua participação e também participará no Conselho de Administração do Observatório sem direito de voto até se tornar membro da União Europeia. O OEDT, por sua vez, tratará a República da Croácia da mesma forma que os actuais Estados-Membros, conferindo-lhe igualdade em termos de ligação à Rede Europeia de Informação sobre a Droga e a Toxicodependência (REITOX) e das disposições relativas ao pessoal.
Em 2005, o Presidente do Azerbaijão, Ilham Aliyev, prometeu que os direitos dos jornalistas seriam respeitados plenamente e que poderiam contar com ajuda em caso de perigo.
Em 2006, a Comissão publicou uma Iniciativa Europeia em matéria de Transparência em que propôs a criação de um balcão único de registo comum dos representantes de interesses na Comissão e no Parlamento. A resposta do Parlamento a esta iniciativa da Comissão foi o relatório da Comissão dos Assuntos Constitucionais sobre o desenvolvimento de um quadro para as actividades dos representantes de interesses nas instituições europeias, aprovado pelo plenário em 8 de Maio de 2008.
Em 2006, fomos abalados pelo massivo escândalo Trafigura envolvendo a deposição de grandes quantidades de resíduos tóxicos na Costa do Marfim. O Comissário do Ambiente ao tempo, o senhor Stavros Dimas, prometeu procurar formas de reforçar o Regulamento relativo às transferências de resíduos e a sua implementação nos Estados-Membros, porém não aconteceu nada de concreto. Há dois anos, um estudo realizado pela Comissão recomendou a criação de uma agência especial com vista à implementação da legislação relativa aos resíduos. A agência deveria realizar numerosas tarefas, tais como controlar os sistemas de verificação existentes nos Estados-Membros e coordenar os controlos e as inspecções, porém nenhuma proposta foi apresentada.
Em 2006, o Comissário Günter Verheugen estimou que o custo da regulamentação comunitária representava em média 3,5% do PIB; 3,5% do PIB do Reino Unido são quase 49 mil milhões de libras esterlinas por ano! Este é um fardo enorme para as empresas e para os consumidores.
Em 2006, o Conselho Europeu convidou a UE e os seus Estados-Membros a alargar as contas nacionais aos principais aspectos do desenvolvimento sustentável, propondo medidas a tomar, a curto e a médio prazo, para desenvolver indicadores globais que proporcionassem um debate público de maior qualidade e ajudassem a tomadas de decisão baseadas nos impactos económicos das medidas ambientais a implementar.
Em 2006, seria a vez de a Comissão, através da Iniciativa Europeia em matéria de Transparência, propor a criação de um balcão único para efeitos de registo dos representantes de interesses na Comissão e no PE. Na verdade, a transparência é essencial no funcionamento das instituições europeias, acusadas, muitas vezes, da sua falta.
Em 2007, foram adoptadas medidas de minimis. Não lhe estamos apenas a pedir medidas de minimis, Senhora Comissária Damanaki: pedimos-lhe que considere a abertura do Fundo Europeu das Pescas (FEP) e que permita que se torne mais flexível, devido à incapacidade - que reconheceu - de alguns Estados-Membros contribuírem com dinheiro e resolverem o problema.
Em 2007, o Conselho Europeu adoptou o Regulamento (CE) n.º 894/2007 relativo a um Acordo de Parceria no domínio das pescas entre a Comunidade Europeia e a República Democrática de São Tomé e Príncipe que incluía um protocolo que fixava as condições de pesca e respectivas contrapartidas financeiras, o qual caducou no dia 31 de Maio de 2010. A Comissão Europeia, consciente da importância da renovação desta parceria e na sequência do mandato conferido pelo Conselho, negociou um novo protocolo, que foi assinado em 15 de Julho de 2010, cuja entrada em vigor depende, nos termos do Tratado sobre o Funcionamento da UE, da aprovação do PE. Considerando que se trata de um protocolo que serve as duas partes e que promove uma pesca responsável e sustentável, voto favoravelmente esta proposta de recomendação.
Em 2007, o Parlamento Europeu (PE), em conjunto com a Comissão Europeia, o Clube de Roma, o Fundo Mundial para a Natureza (WWW) e a OCDE, organizou uma conferência subordinada ao tema "Para Além do PIB” onde os intervenientes defenderam a necessidade de se desenvolver outros indicadores complementares do PIB. O presente relatório, da responsabilidade de Anna Rosbach, parte de uma comunicação, apresentada pela Comissão em 28 de Setembro de 2009, denominada "O PIB e mais além: Medir o progresso num Mundo em mudança”, e reflecte esta necessidade de dotar os políticos e todos os investigadores de dados mais abrangentes.
Em 2007, quando a Roménia e a Bulgária aderiram à UE, adoptaram o acervo de Schengen.
Em 2008, a Comissão Europeia apresentou uma proposta de directiva relativa aos direitos dos consumidores. É muito mais importante para os consumidores europeus que a sua protecção seja reforçada ao nível da UE. Este processo não deve assumir a forma de medidas restritivas, como as que se aplicavam aos levantamentos a descoberto, mas deve combater práticas comerciais duvidosas, fraudes, entre outros aspectos.
Em 2008, a Comissão apresentou uma proposta de directiva sobre os direitos dos consumidores.
Em 2008, já era responsável por 860 mil milhões de euros, 14 milhões de postos de trabalho e quase 7% do PIB.
Em 2008, também o Acordo da OMC sobre os Têxteis e o Vestuário, celebrado entre a UE e a República Popular da China, havia chegado ao fim, bem como todos os restantes sistemas de vigilância das importações de têxteis e de vestuário daquele país oriental.
Em 2009, a decisão realmente crucial em matéria de política externa e de segurança comum (PESC) foi a nomeação da Alta Representante. Há que reconhecer que a decisão não foi a melhor. É bem evidente que Lady Ashton é mais dotada para emitir comunicados de imprensa moralizadores e representar o papel de Dama Generosa do que talhada para tratar das questões diplomáticas que se pretende que ela resolva em nome dos 27 Estados-Membros.
Em 2009, por exemplo, as autoridades chinesas aprovaram um sistema de acreditação de produtos locais inovadores, que limitou ainda mais o acesso das empresas internacionais ao mercado chinês. No entanto, o problema não reside apenas no mercado chinês, pois economias muito desenvolvidas como os Estados Unidos, o Japão e o Canadá também praticam políticas proteccionistas.
Em 2009, um total de 7 934 pessoas foram tratadas pelos institutos nacionais de toxicodependência. O número de apreensões diminuiu para todas a drogas, à excepção da heroína, comparativamente com o ano anterior e, no geral, foram feitos progressos no combate à toxicodependência.
Em 2010, a Comissão publicou o Plano de Acção sobre Aplicações do Sistema Global de Navegação por Satélite (GNSS). O Plano de Acção delineia as soluções necessárias para assegurar o êxito da navegação por satélite. O Plano de Acção insere-se no contexto global de implantação geral dos sistemas globais de navegação por satélite e, em especial, de desenvolvimento e implantação do sistema europeu complementar de navegação geostacionário EGNOS.
Em 2010, apresentei uma pergunta escrita à Comissária Malmström com o objectivo de saber que medidas tinha a Comissão tomado para apurar o papel de organizações não-governamentais no financiamento do terrorismo. O facto de os organizadores da flotilha no ano passado pensarem em repetir essa acção no aniversário do incidente e de os eurodeputados dos grupos políticos GUE/NGL e Verts/ALE terem organizado uma audição no PE em 10 de Maio coloca de novo a questão no centro das atenções. Se nós, europeus, consideramos a paz, a democratização no Médio Oriente, a erradicação da extrema pobreza e o desenvolvimento de condições de vida na Faixa de Gaza como nosso objectivo final, a flotilha não constitui um meio adequado para a facilitação desta nobre causa, como a Vice-Presidente/Alta Representante Baronesa Ashton referiu há pouco.
Em 2010, o montante total do comércio bilateral entre a UE e o Japão, a terceira maior economia do mundo em termos de PIB, elevou-se a 120 mil milhões de euros, sendo o Japão o sexto maior parceiro comercial da UE e a UE o terceiro maior parceiro comercial do Japão. Há, no entanto, um grande potencial de comércio por explorar, pelo que é necessária uma grande determinação para reforçar as relações comerciais entre a UE e o Japão, centrando-se na remoção das barreiras não pautais ao comércio e ao investimento, incluindo numerosas normas restritivas e medidas reguladoras para o acesso ao mercado japonês de empresas europeias.
Em 2010, os países da UE cumpriram apenas um dos cinco objectivos de referência definidos para a educação, e isso nada augura de bom para a estratégia "Europa 2020". Para que a iniciativa "Juventude em Movimento" seja mais bem-sucedida, a sua execução e os seus progressos terão de ser acompanhados de perto no terreno, bem como nos nossos círculos eleitorais, pelos membros desta Assembleia.
Em 2011, a Comissão pretende apresentar uma comunicação sobre a responsabilidade social das empresas, que defina propostas para novas acções a nível internacional, inclusive a promoção da responsabilidade social nas relações com os países parceiros.
Em 2050, a proporção entre cidadãos comunitários em idade activa e cidadãos com mais de 65 anos irá decrescer de 4:1 para 2:1. Em consequência, os gastos com pensões de reforma e cuidados de saúde irão certamente aumentar.
Em 2050, esse número situar-se-á nos 5% ou 6%. Em 2100, representaremos 3% dessa população. Esta multidão de europeus continua a manter, em grande medida através dos orçamentos nacionais, 2 000 embaixadas, 27 exércitos, 50 forças conjuntas e outros elementos.
Em 23 de Janeiro de 2004, após uma declaração feita durante um programa, a senhora deputada Hankiss foi acusada de um alegado crime de difamação da honra cometido em público e, em especial, de difamação da memória de uma pessoa já falecida.
Em 25 de Março de 2011, o Conselho Europeu reiterou a importância estratégica da relação UE-Japão, afirmando que "Dever-se-á aproveitar a próxima cimeira para reforçar essa relação e fazer avançar a nossa agenda comum". A esse propósito, o Conselho salientou que as condições para um ACL bem sucedido devem ser analisadas com base no pressuposto de que o Japão esteja disposto a abordar, nomeadamente, a questão das barreiras não pautais e das restrições aos contratos públicos.
Em 28 de Setembro de 2009, a Comissão apresentou uma Comunicação denominada O PIB e mais além: Medir o progresso num Mundo em mudança, propondo medidas em ordem à criação de uma base de dados sobre as contas relativas ao ambiente da União Europeia, tendo em vista um melhor debate público e uma tomada de decisão mais bem sustentada. A Comissão, até finais de 2013, deve apresentar um relatório que responda a questões tais como: qual a situação das nossas florestas? Até que ponto é que os nossos recursos haliêuticos se encontram exauridos? Para esse efeito, necessitamos de uma base estatística credível e actualizada, a criar com este regulamento. O quadro jurídico criado com esta proposta permitirá à UE avaliar as contas do ambiente tendo em conta o desenvolvimento sustentável.
Em 29 de Setembro de 2010, a Comissão apresentou um pacote legislativo destinado a reforçar a governação económica na UE e na zona do euro. O pacote é composto por seis propostas: quatro delas tratam de questões orçamentais, incluindo uma reforma do Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento (PEC), enquanto dois novos regulamentos visam detectar e resolver os desequilíbrios macroeconómicos emergentes na UE e na zona do euro. O presente projecto de parecer diz respeito à proposta, apresentada pela Comissão, de regulamento do Conselho que altera o Regulamento (CE) n.º 1466/97 relativo ao reforço da supervisão das situações orçamentais e à supervisão e coordenação das políticas económicas. É consensual que o PEC, tanto na sua vertente preventiva como na sua vertente correctiva, falhou e carece de ser reformado.
Em 31 de Dezembro de 2010 terminou a fase III-A e em 1 de Janeiro de 2011 teve início a fase III-B. Os limites estabelecidos para a fase recém-iniciada são muito mais rigorosos que os aplicados na fase anterior.
Em 6 de Maio de 2009, o Parlamento procedeu à revisão do seu Regimento e criou, no artigo 51.º, um novo processo de reuniões conjuntas de comissões, tendo em vista agilizar procedimentos no que respeita à aprovação de matérias que extravasam as competências de uma só comissão, de modo a ser apresentado ao plenário do PE apenas um relatório que reflicta a posição de todas as comissões envolvidas. A análise feita pela Conferência dos Presidentes das Comissões a um projecto de directrizes para a cooperação no âmbito do artigo 51.º levou a um pedido de apreciação à Comissão dos Assuntos Constitucionais por parte do Presidente da Conferência.
Em Abril, lançaram uma série de ataques a edifícios cristãos em Beni Ahmad, Bashtil e Kamadir.
Em Abyei, a situação é difícil, mas, mais uma vez, a posição da União Europeia é a de uma condenação muito clara e forte da ocupação, e de exigência de uma resolução imediata da situação. A decisão sobre a situação compete, basicamente, ao Conselho de Segurança das Nações Unidas.
Em Fevereiro de 2011, a Comissão registou a sua 1 000.ª denominação de qualidade para um produto alimentar. É evidente, no entanto, que o número de pedidos de registo ao abrigo dos regimes de indicação geográfica protegida (IGP), da denominação de origem protegida (DOP) e das especialidades tradicionais garantidas (ETG) varia consideravelmente de um Estado-Membro para outro.
Em Janeiro de 2009, a Comissão aprovou a proposta para um novo regulamento relativo às denominações das fibras têxteis e à correspondente etiquetagem dos produtos têxteis. A finalidade da proposta consiste em simplificar e melhorar o quadro regulamentar existente relativo à etiquetagem de produtos têxteis, com vista a encorajar o desenvolvimento e a aceitação de novas fibras.
Em Janeiro de 2011, como previsto no CPA, teve lugar um referendo, que marcou a última etapa do caminho para a independência do Sul relativamente ao Sudão do Norte.
Em Janeiro deste ano, algumas dezenas de funcionários aduaneiros búlgaros foram detidos por corrupção. Em Fevereiro deste ano foram detidos cerca de 200 funcionários aduaneiros romenos, também por corrupção. Ambos os países atingem níveis preocupantemente elevados quando se trata de tráfico de seres humanos.
Em Janeiro, tivemos os problemas das toxinas na Alemanha; agora temos problemas com bactérias, novamente na Alemanha. O primeiro caso foi encoberto, se bem que dele houvesse conhecimento há meses; no segundo caso, a culpa foi convenientemente atribuída aos pepinos espanhóis.
Em Junho de 2010, a Comissão publicou Plano de Acção relativo às Aplicações do Sistema Global de Navegação por Satélite (GNSS), que inclui 24 recomendações específicas. O plano de acção foi elaborado num período em que os sistemas globais de navegação por satélite estavam a ser implementados, especificamente, o sistema do Serviço Europeu Complementar de Navegação Geoestacionária (EGNOS). Os sistemas de navegação por satélite deveriam assegurar a cooperação entre os diversos sistemas e ser utilizáveis em transportes de carga e de passageiros.
Em Junho do ano passado, nós - a UE e os EUA - emitimos uma declaração conjunta sobre o combate ao terrorismo, na qual se afirma que a guerra contra o terror tem de respeitar os valores fundamentais e o princípio do Estado de direito. O acordo especifica que todos os procedimentos de tribunal contra suspeitos de terrorismo têm de ter um enquadramento legal adequado, que assegure que o direito processual adequado será seguido e garanta um julgamento justo que seja acessível ao público, na medida do possível, e que decorra de forma eficiente.
Em Junho, a Organização Internacional do Trabalho (OIT), que irá em breve realizar a sua conferência anual, deverá adoptar uma convenção sobre os trabalhadores domésticos, exigindo igualdade de tratamento com os demais trabalhadores e o cumprimento de todas as condições inerentes ao desempenho de um trabalho digno.
Em Maio de 2001, representantes do grupo de África, Caraíbas e Pacífico-União Europeia (ACP-UE) defenderam a opinião de que Madagáscar deveria ter, tão rapidamente quanto possível, uma administração temporária viável.
Em Março de 2000, o Conselho definiu para a União Europeia o ambicioso objectivo de se tornar "a economia baseada no conhecimento mais dinâmica e competitiva do mundo” até 2010. O papel central desempenhado pela investigação nesta estratégia tem sido reconhecido.
Em Março e Junho de 2010, o Conselho Europeu adoptou a estratégia Europa 2020, cuja principal prioridade é o reforço da coordenação das estratégias de política económica nos EstadosMembros e, como objectivos a longo prazo, um crescimento sustentável e inclusivo e um nível de emprego sustentável.
Em Novembro de 2009, o Supremo Tribunal considerou que houvera de facto uma violação de disposições substantivas de direito penal tendo ordenado que o Tribunal Distrital Central de Buda conduzisse um novo processo. O tribunal deve conduzir este processo renovado à luz das considerações que constam da decisão do Supremo Tribunal. O Tribunal Central Distrital de Buda deu início ao novo processo em 31de Março de 2010.
Em Novembro de 2010, a Comissão publicou uma proposta de directiva que estabelece um quadro jurídico da UE para a gestão de combustível irradiado e de resíduos radioactivos.
Em Novembro de 2010, o grupo de trabalho pôde aprovar um projecto de acordo para o estabelecimento de um "Registo da Transparência", que parece assegurar a maior participação possível de todas as categorias de operadores, respeitando embora as suas identidades diferentes ou específicas.
Em alguns Estados-Membros já é possível comprar 1 Gb por menos de 1 euro.
Em alguns casos, estão a ser utilizados de forma pouco proporcionada para a extradição de suspeitos de pequenos delitos, como o furto de uma bicicleta ou de um leitão. Trata-se de um procedimento desnecessário que pode prejudicar a legitimidade desta poderosa ferramenta de reconhecimento mútuo na UE. É este o motivo de a Comissão instar à tomada de medidas.
Em alguns países, o termo "lobista" tem uma conotação negativa, enquanto noutros a actividade dos grupos de pressão é vista quase como um serviço de interesse público, pois informa os decisores sobre problemas que, de outro modo, poderiam desconhecer.
Em antecipação ao Livro Branco, a legislação agora prevista obriga os Estados-Membros e a Comissão a tomarem os próximos passos para um sistema de transporte mais sustentável e interoperacional, um sistema de taxação harmonizado e mais internalização de custos externos.
Em antecipação do relatório do Parlamento, já principiámos a trabalhar com os Estados-Membros para desenvolvermos mais e mais claramente as necessidades exactas de informação a nível da UE. O relatório irá ajudar-nos a pôr em evidência este trabalho.
Em boa verdade, a única coisa que a Comissão teria de fazer seria propor a inclusão, na directiva pertinente, de uma lista "negra" destas práticas publicitárias enganosas proibidas.
Em breve verificámos que, em certa medida, era possível aplicar as disposições de diferentes maneiras - não apenas na Áustria, mas também em alguns outros Estados-Membros, incluindo o meu próprio país.
Em caso de divergência entre os auditores da Comissão e os organismos auditados, proponho que seja permitida a possibilidade de conduzir contra-auditorias independentes e que um mediador seja autorizado a intervir, para que não tenhamos de pedir ao Tribunal de Contas Europeu para solucionar quaisquer litígios que possam surgir entre os organismos objecto de auditoria e a Comissão. Temos realmente de resolver este assunto, Senhora Comissária.
Em casos especiais, já temos a possibilidade de reintroduzir os controlos por um período limitado numa região circunscrita onde haja uma ameaça grave à segurança interna.
Em certa medida, as instituições de crédito têm prestado aquilo a que em direito francês se chama uma forma de apoio abusiva a uma estrutura sobreendividada. A sua conduta foi imprópria e causaram um prejuízo: têm, por isso, a obrigação de ressarcir.
Em conclusão, acredito que este relatório assinala um primeiro passo no desenvolvimento deste sector.
Em conclusão, gostaria de apoiar a autora da resolução, a senhora deputada Berès, quando afirma que a União Europeia deveria liderar a melhoria das condições dos trabalhadores domésticos.
Em conclusão, gostaria de dizer, Senhoras e Senhores Deputados, que apoio vivamente - e o Comissário Füle já o mencionou num tom, a meu ver, muito positivo - o estabelecimento de uma delegação permanente da UE na Mongólia, porque acredito nas possibilidades de desenvolvimento das relações políticas e comerciais, tendo em conta o facto importante de existirem vastas reservas de matérias-primas nesse país, estrategicamente situado entre a China e a Rússia.
Em conclusão, gostaria de referir que a situação na Bielorrússia continua a ser prioritária para a nossa agenda.
Em conclusão, lembremo-nos da natureza extraordinária do terramoto e da força do tsunami que atingiram a central de Fukushima e que desencadearam todo este processo.
Em conclusão, partilho das preocupações expressas pelos representantes da indústria italiana de que a indústria não está neste momento em posição de assumir compromissos mais ambiciosos para além dos já estabelecidos pelo Conselho Europeu e confirmados pela Comissão na Directiva relativa à criação de um regime europeu de comércio de licenças de emissão de gases com efeito de estufa.
Em conclusão, quero dizer-vos a todos que, em termos de responsabilidade, a falta de acordo nesta matéria teria, nas actuais circunstâncias, um custo extremamente elevado.
Em conclusão, é imperioso dotar as autoridades do condado de Donegal de mais recursos financeiros para fazerem face aos custos excepcionais que isso envolverá.
Em conformidade com a proposta da Comissão, os Estados-Membros deveriam, assim, ser dotados de uma metodologia, normas comuns, definições, classificações e regras contabilísticas, que deveriam ser agrupadas num quadro vinculativo para cada um deles.
Em conformidade com o acordo, a Croácia participará no programa de trabalho do Observatório, respeitará as obrigações estabelecidas na legislação da UE e partilhará dados com o OEDT, no respeito das exigências da União em matéria de protecção de dados.
Em conformidade com o artigo 21.º do Tratado da União Europeia, a UE compromete-se oficialmente a promover um multilateralismo efectivo no âmbito de uma Organização das Nações Unidas forte, o que é essencial para fazer face aos desafios globais, como as alterações climáticas e a degradação ambiental, a universalidade e a indivisibilidade dos direitos humanos, a redução da pobreza e o desenvolvimento para todos, as consequências das alterações demográficas e das migrações, e o crime organizado a nível internacional.
Em conformidade com o artigo 21.º do Tratado da União Europeia, a UE compromete-se oficialmente a promover um multilateralismo efectivo no âmbito de uma Organização das Nações Unidas forte, o que é essencial para fazer face aos desafios globais.
Em conjunto, os mercados de transporte aéreo da União Europeia e dos Estados Unidos correspondem a cerca de 60% do tráfego aéreo mundial. A futura abertura do mercado às companhias aéreas da UE e dos EUA em condições de não-discriminação resultará na prestação de melhores serviços aos passageiros e aos operadores de transportes aéreos, gerará benefícios económicos significativos e criará postos de trabalho.
Em consequência da crise económica, alguns Estados-Membros têm menos disponibilidade para apoiar o programa, e a UE encontra-se perante o desafio de identificar com rigor que países necessitam de apoio e proporcionar-lhes esse apoio. A execução do programa durará mais dois anos e o nível de autorizações do orçamento não ultrapassou os 50% (de 54 000 milhões de euros para o período 2007-2013), o que deverá facilitar a promoção da participação dos organismos competentes e permitir que os fundos disponíveis sejam utilizados tão adequadamente quanto possível.
Em consequência da dominante e crescente concorrência económica a nível mundial, as condições dos trabalhadores estão a deteriorar-se ainda mais, com a sua remuneração a sofrer reduções e a idade de trabalho a aumentar tendo em vista a realização de lucros.
Em consequência das medidas que visam a internalização dos custos externos, é provável que se verifique um aumento da eficiência económica e que os efeitos ambientais negativos diminuam.
Em consequência disso, não serão feitas alterações ao conteúdo.
Em consonância com a comunicação da Comissão sobre a revisão do orçamento e as conclusões do quinto relatório sobre coesão social, a estratégia "Europa 2020" fornece tanto um conjunto claro de prioridades comuns como o quadro para identificar as prioridades de financiamento depois de 2013, de acordo com os objectivos do crescimento inteligente, sustentável e inclusivo, incluindo o desenvolvimento do capital humano. A Comissão apresentará as suas propostas para o próximo quadro financeiro plurianual até ao fim de Junho.
Em contrapartida, uma legislação sustentada e apoiada por argumentos científicos, com a contribuição de todas as partes, e que acabe por conduzir a uma legislação que seja aceitável para todos, não deixando contudo de ser funcional, isso sim, conduzirá a uma maior prosperidade na Europa.
Em crises deste tipo, é fundamental, tanto para os consumidores como para os produtores de alimentos, a criação, o mais rápido possível, de uma célula europeia de coordenação que zele tanto pelas comunicações como pela coordenação da investigação científica.
Em diferentes regiões da Europa, encontramos níveis de ensino que não são iguais, pelo que a necessidade de melhorar a situação neste domínio parece ser inquestionável. É importante que os jovens tenham a oportunidade de desempenhar um papel activo no mundo do trabalho e também na sociedade civil no seu sentido mais amplo.
Em diversas situações, o PIB pode aumentar enquanto a maioria dos cidadãos de um país ficam mais pobres, pois o PIB não considera o nível de desigualdade de uma sociedade.
Em documentos relacionados sobre o tema da resolução, tanto o Conselho como a Comissão afirmaram que uma das condições para iniciar as negociações com o Japão é a eliminação das barreiras regulamentares ao comércio, designadamente as barreiras não pautais, que impõem restrições significativas de acesso ao mercado japonês por parte dos empresários europeus.
Em especial, a proposta de resolução pede um melhoramento e uma facilitação dos serviços à comunidade Roma, definida na proposta de resolução como comunidade "marginalizada”. A Lega Nord salientou sempre que a minoria Roma não pode ser considerada vítima de qualquer tipo de "marginalização” social, na medida em que é essa própria minoria que recusa integrar-se na nossa sociedade.
Em especial, apreciei a referência à qualidade enquanto fundação para a construção de tudo o resto.
Em especial, congratulo-me com o que refere quanto ao direito de resolução que é atribuído aos consumidores após a compra em linha de um produto.
Em especial, para os países de rendimento médio, a mobilização de receitas domésticas é essencial para reduzir a pobreza e a dependência da ajuda.
Em especial, será importante simplificar e acelerar os processos de atribuição, especialmente em favor das PME, e encorajar o financiamento através de multi-fundos e financiamento cruzado.
Em especial, votei a favor do relatório Haglund porque penso que, no futuro, teremos de evitar a repetição dos erros do passado, e teremos de conseguir excluir a possibilidade de que alguns países da área do euro violem as normas de estabilidade que serão adoptadas.
Em especial, é preocupante o facto de este sistema de navegação por satélite ser encarado numa lógica de competição com o sistema GPS dos EUA, do qual depende a UE, o qual se encontra, como se sabe, sob o controlo militar, com financiamento militar dos programas federais norte-americanos.
Em face do desastre visível causado por este caminho, a UE, em lugar de arrepiar caminho, continua a dar sinais de querer forçar uma fuga em frente.
Em face do exposto, votei favoravelmente a proposta do Parlamento Europeu, que aprova a proposta da Comissão, na redacção resultante da adaptação às recomendações do Grupo Consultivo dos Serviços Jurídicos do Parlamento Europeu, do Conselho e da Comissão.
Em face do exposto, votei favoravelmente a proposta do Parlamento Europeu, que faz sua a proposta da Comissão, na redacção resultante da adaptação às recomendações do Grupo Consultivo dos Serviços Jurídicos do Parlamento Europeu, do Conselho e da Comissão.
Em geral, as agências são supervisionadas por um conselho de administração cujos membros podem variar de acordo com a natureza da agência.
Em geral, as empresas recusam-se a estabelecer relações a longo prazo numa região e, consequentemente, a partilhar responsabilidades sociais comuns dessa região. O relatório apela ao reforço das normas laborais fundamentais consignadas nas convenções da Organização Internacional do Trabalho, nomeadamente as respeitantes à liberdade de associação e de negociação colectiva, à eliminação do trabalho forçado e obrigatório, à eliminação da discriminação no local de trabalho e à abolição do trabalho infantil.
Em geral, considero que as euro-obrigações não são uma solução milagrosa.
Em geral, são acordos que carecem, cada vez mais, de legitimidade democrática, já que são negociados, quase sempre, no maior secretismo, nas costas dos cidadãos, procurando ocultar os seus impactos económicos, sociais e ambientais, fugindo ao debate informado e ao esclarecimento.
Em jeito de comentário à margem, tenho de responder às afirmações do senhor deputado Tabajdi.
Em lugar de criticar a flotilha, a UE deve condenar as ameaças de recurso à violência que nos foram feitas pelas Forças de Defesa de Israel.
Em meu entender, as pequenas empresas devem ser apoiadas de forma a aumentarem a sua competitividade nos mercados internacionais através do reforço da sua capacidade de exportação, da divulgação de informações relativas a programas e iniciativas facilitadoras do acesso aos mercados internacionais e da penetração dos bens e serviços das PME, e assegurando que os interesses das pequenas empresas são devidamente representados.
Em meu entender, com estes seis elementos, encontrará parceiros no Parlamento Europeu. O Grupo da Aliança Progressista dos Socialistas e Democratas no Parlamento Europeu sabe que ainda nos encontramos nas fases precoces da cooperação entre a Senhora Alta Representante e o Parlamento e há domínios nos quais é preciso introduzir melhorias. É por isso que reitero a minha oferta em nome, julgo eu, da maioria dos deputados deste Parlamento.
Em meu entender, o relatório Mitchell, um documento excelente, aborda muitos temas fulcrais, motivo pelo qual decidi votar a favor da sua aprovação. No debate sobre a forma que os instrumentos de financiamento da cooperação para o desenvolvimento hão-de revestir no futuro, penso que o mais importante é ter em conta que o objectivo primordial da política de desenvolvimento deve ser o de reduzir gradualmente a dependência da ajuda, fazendo com que o país em questão se torne completamente independente neste domínio.
Em meu entender, uma estratégia de sucesso para a promoção de PME inovadoras não pode assentar apenas na concessão de subsídios, mas na criação de um enquadramento empresarial no qual as PME disponham de mais liberdade e de melhores acessos às diferentes fontes de financiamento.
Em meu entender, é urgente que a Comissão proponha, com carácter de urgência, os investimentos, quer a nível europeu quer a nível nacional, em novas tecnologias, com vista a aumentar a eficiência energética das embarcações de pesca, que permitam reduzir a dependência dos pescadores dos combustíveis fósseis.
Em minha opinião, a Letónia é um bom exemplo no domínio da protecção dos consumidores, porque os nossos padrões estão entre os mais elevados, mas são ao mesmo tempo proporcionais e não oneram os negócios com exigências burocráticas.
Em minha opinião, a proposta de alterar as avaliações de impacto de acordo com as alterações apresentadas pelo Parlamento é muito importante e partilho também da opinião daqueles que entendem que todas as instituições têm de aplicar critérios uniformes às avaliações de impacto.
Em minha opinião, ainda existem, no domínio da saúde, lacunas importantes decorrentes da precipitação radioactiva que é necessário preencher. A controvérsia relacionada com os números continuamente falsificados da Agência Internacional de Energia Atómica tem de ser desenredada.
Em minha opinião, devemos aprofundar as questões no domínio agrícola e as relacionadas com movimentos demográficos.
Em minha opinião, esta decisão é um passo importante para aumentar a transparência e estou ansioso por que o Conselho da União Europeia adira ao registo comum.
Em minha opinião, o Centro Europeu de Prevenção e Controlo das Doenças (ECDC) fez um bom trabalho, tanto quanto me é dado entender, mas necessitamos de uma obrigação de comunicação melhor, e moderna, para determinar as causas e também de um sistema melhor de informação do grande público.
Em minha opinião, o relatório aprovado constitui um contributo eficaz para estes objectivos.
Em minha opinião, para que a formação profissional se adapte às necessidades do mercado de trabalho, convirá que as estratégias e programas nacionais de educação tenham em conta as informações sobre alterações no mercado de trabalho.
Em minha opinião, um sistema melhorado, garantindo a equidade, a transparência e receitas orçamentais suficientes, permitiria que o processo de tomada de decisões orçamentais se centrasse mais nas prioridades fundamentais da União. Em particular, as excepções e os mecanismos de correcção existentes deveriam ser gradualmente eliminados, o que constituiria um passo indispensável para tornar o orçamento da UE mais equitativo e transparente.
Em minha opinião, uma boa solução seria não só uma mera renovação, mas também a modernização e o investimento tecnológico em infra-estruturas, através das tecnologias da informação. Poderíamos então ter a certeza de que iria ocorrer nas cidades um acentuado crescimento e a melhoria da qualidade de vida.
Em minha opinião, é fundamental estabelecer uma definição clara e inequívoca de responsabilidade social das empresas que acabe com a actual diversidade de interpretações e fixar métodos de avaliação do seu cumprimento.
Em momentos de grandes dificuldades, ninguém pode defender que temos de gastar mais.
Em muitas regiões da União Europeia o desemprego dos jovens ultrapassa os 40%. É isto que torna tão premente uma revisão profunda das políticas que visam abrir o mercado de trabalho aos jovens, com acontece com o relatório Juventude em Movimento.
Em muitos aspectos, continua a haver um fosso manifesto entre diferentes regiões da UE. O progresso varia significativamente entre países e por temas: determinados domínios estratégicos enfrentam demoras especiais no processo de selecção.
Em muitos casos, as soluções necessárias para adaptar os tractores aos novos motores ainda não existem ou não são definitivas.
Em média, a dívida na área do euro é inferior à do Reino Unido, para dar um exemplo.
Em nome da liberdade, mas também da segurança, há que assegurara maior transparência.
Em nome do Grupo do Partido Popular Europeu (Democratas-Cristãos), gostaria também de destacar o que a senhora deputada Goulard referiu acerca da simetria e da assimetria. O processo de dar e receber é realmente algo que se verifica nesta Câmara, e todos têm as suas prioridades.
Em nome do meu grupo, gostaria de afirmar claramente mais uma vez que queremos uma solução boa para os investidores, os trabalhadores e os Estados-Membros.
Em nome do senhor Presidente Barroso, gostaria de salientar uma vez mais que a Comissão não faz juízos políticos sobre escolhas constitucionais e institucionais fundamentais dos Estados-Membros. A adopção de uma nova Constituição num Estado-Membro é um assunto que compete aos seus cidadãos e às suas instituições.
Em nossa opinião, muitos pontos podiam ter sido redigidos com maior clareza, como os termos utilizados para os pagamentos no âmbito do primeiro pilar - rotação de culturas, protecção dos prados -, mas cabe agora à Comissão dar corpo às disposições finais.
Em nosso entender, as avaliações de impacto realizadas pelas instituições europeias deveriam obedecer a certos princípios.
Em paralelo com o estabelecimento do sistema de asilo em toda a Europa, o que levaria também a uma maior partilha de responsabilidades (porque se todos os Estados-Membros dispuserem de um sistema que funciona, todos os Estados-Membros poderão receber os requerentes de asilo), a solução para a Grécia passa por prosseguir os planos de reforma que estão a ser executados no âmbito do plano de acção para este país. A Comissão e os Estados-Membros estão a apoiar a Grécia com grandes quantidades de dinheiro, experiência, intérpretes e administradores.
Em particular nas áreas em que tenha competências exclusivas ou partilhadas, considera essencial, no que diz respeito à aspiração da UE de ser um actor global e de salvaguardar a sua posição, o reforço da coordenação interna necessária para falar a uma só voz, a capacidade de dar forma à cooperação multilateral e de conduzir a acção colectiva para responder aos desafios internacionais, designadamente aqueles que decorrem da responsabilidade de proteger, e a necessidade de reforçar a segurança humana como meio para alcançar a segurança global.
Em particular o relator, senhor deputado Manders, fez um excelente trabalho e zelou para que testemunhássemos uma cooperação verdadeiramente excelente aqui, no Parlamento Europeu.
Em particular, a experiência dos últimos dois anos confirmou que a obtenção de uma forte competitividade, crescimento económico sustentável e disponibilidade de postos de trabalho exige um nível sustentável de défice e dívida públicos, reformas para eliminar desequilíbrios macroeconómicos e uma estratégia comunitária para o crescimento e o emprego.
Em particular, a introdução de um imposto sobre as transacções financeiras é uma questão que temos finalmente de colocar em cima da mesa. Não se trata apenas de um instrumento financeiro útil, mas também de um elemento que proporciona uma maior transparência no que respeita ao modo como a UE é financiada.
Em particular, analisámos de perto o excelente relatório do Parlamento sobre o FEG, elaborado pelo senhor deputado Portas há alguns meses.
Em particular, ela deve concentrar-se nas questões ambientais a nível europeu e assegurar que sejam tidas em conta através da sua incorporação no primeiro pilar.
Em particular, ele não mede a sustentabilidade ambiental ou a integração social. A meu ver, no debate político e científico que dura há anos, o problema reside sobretudo em saber como aplicar esta abordagem utilizando indicadores claramente definidos e quantificáveis. A nível europeu e dos Estados-Membros, tem havido muitas iniciativas para colmatar as lacunas existentes nestes domínios.
Em particular, este relatório insta os Estados-Membros a criarem oportunidades de formação específicas para grupos como os jovens desempregados, as minorias étnicas, as mulheres vulneráveis e as pessoas com deficiência, para melhorar a integração social e reforçar a coesão social. O relatório salienta ainda que devem ser criadas possibilidades de financiamento mais alargadas, simplificadas e facilmente acessíveis utilizando as verbas disponíveis do Fundo Social Europeu, do Programa de Aprendizagem ao Longo da Vida no seu conjunto e do programa "Erasmus para jovens empresários”.
Em particular, haverá que desenvolver mais esforços para chegar a um mesmo nível de ambição no que respeita à definição, de comum acordo, do conteúdo das negociações, bem como a um resultado ambicioso, ainda que realista, dessas negociações.
Em particular, o PIB não mede o nível de sustentabilidade ambiental ou de integração social.
Em particular, o compromisso de Hans Gustaf Wessberg para com o tecido empresarial do sector privado torna o candidato particularmente adequado para garantir o equilíbrio entre o direito comunitário e as exigências específicas, quer do mercado, quer das populações da Europa.
Em particular, o domínio dos direitos de propriedade intelectual exige um tratamento inequívoco e justo, pois é inadmissível, do ponto de vista dos direitos humanos, pôr em risco os direitos fundamentais dos habitantes mais pobres dos países em desenvolvimento, incluindo o direito de acesso a medicamentos genéricos e a cuidados de saúde. A Comissão e as autoridades indianas devem forçosamente intensificar a sua cooperação em torno de uma definição comum de medicamentos de contrafacção, uma problemática de peso que é prejudicial para a saúde dos pacientes, de modo que a saúde pública seja adequadamente protegida.
Em particular, observo que estes novos regulamentos fornecem aos consumidores um prazo de resolução de 14 dias após a compra, com um formulário de resolução uniformizado em toda a UE, e que este período pode até ser alargado para um ano, se o vendedor não informar o comprador do direito de resolução. Por fim, estão previstas isenções para as pequenas e médias empresas, que nos informaram que os seus negócios poderiam ficar ameaçados se o texto fosse demasiado rigoroso.
Em particular, os Estados-Membros devem introduzir reformas nos seus métodos de investigação em matéria de segurança, uma das principais áreas mencionadas no relatório, por forma a garantir que seja optimizada em tempos de crise financeira.
Em particular, quais as medidas que poderão vir a ser tomadas com base nos resultados da consulta pública e, em segundo lugar, a Comissão pode indicar quais os projectos-pilotos específicos que foram seleccionados nesta fase
Em particular, urge simplificar a PAC: tem de haver menos burocracia tanto para a administração como para os agricultores, e os custos de gestão da política a nível dos Estados-Membros têm de ser reduzidos.
Em particular, votei a favor do relatório Feio porque acredito que coloca correctamente a ênfase no papel essencial que o Parlamento deve desempenhar na prevenção de futuras crises económicas. O texto sublinha a importância central do diálogo que o Parlamento terá de estabelecer com os representantes dos parlamentos nacionais de modo a salvaguardar o processo democrático quando surgirem questões relacionadas com a estabilidade económica da UE. Além do mais, o relatório propõe um período de três anos para a redução da dívida total, o que considero razoável e suficiente.
Em particular, votei a favor do relatório Ferreira porque acredito que a ênfase no papel do painel de avaliação, enquanto instrumento para identificar possíveis desequilíbrios por meio de critérios específicos é uma base excelente para analisar o problema.
Em particular, votei a favor do relatório Ford porque acredito que a harmonização dos sistemas nacionais através do desenvolvimento de requisitos mínimos e, acima de tudo, a previsão de planos para os sistemas de contabilidade pública são regras básicas se quisermos impedir futuras crises económicas.
Em pleno século XXI, ainda estamos a assistir a um julgamento vergonhoso, cujas condenações não são redigidas em tribunal. E isto acontece num país ligado à UE através da chamada parceria estratégica. O acórdão do tribunal de Moscovo revelou uma vez mais graves falhas no sistema judicial russo e reforçou a opinião de que castiga aqueles que na Rússia têm ambições políticas, mas cujas opiniões não coincidem com as do Kremlin.
Em primeira leitura foi aprovado um texto que previa que as etiquetas indicassem a denominação de origem, bem como uma lista completa e obrigatória da composição do produto.
Em primeira leitura, o Parlamento Europeu aprovou 63 alterações à proposta da Comissão sobre um regulamento relativo às denominações das fibras têxteis e à correspondente etiquetagem dos produtos têxteis, umas de natureza técnica e outras de fundo, incluindo regras relativas à marcação de origem, indicação de materiais derivados de animais, utilização de símbolos independentes da língua e uma cláusula de revisão. As alterações técnicas foram, no essencial, acolhidas pelo Conselho, que, no entanto, rejeitou todas as alterações de fundo propostas pelo PE. Grande parte destas alterações foram agora retomadas, afigurando-se importante que o Conselho possa reconhecer o respectivo relevo e dar-lhes a devida sequência.
Em primeira linha, é de salientar que estamos perante "o único domínio da acção externa (...) que não foi concebido para servir os interesses da UE, mas sim para defender os interesses das populações mais marginalizadas e vulneráveis do planeta”. Neste contexto, o Parlamento deve assumir uma posição de maior prevalência não só pela sua legitimação democrática (e plural), mas também pelos contributos que pode oferecer a nível material e procedimental.
Em primeiro ligar, queria salientar que os testes de stress são para nós território desconhecido.
Em primeiro lugar, a Comissão insta os Estados-Membros da UE a aplicarem um teste de proporcionalidade quando solicitarem um Mandado de Detenção, e a colmatarem as lacunas da sua legislação que não cumpram plenamente a decisão-quadro que estabelece o Mandado de Detenção. Instamos igualmente os Estados-Membros a garantirem que os profissionais da justiça, designadamente os procuradores, não emitam Mandados de Detenção para delitos menores.
Em primeiro lugar, a Comissão tem a ambição - aliás muito justificável - de promover o desenvolvimento regional em África.
Em primeiro lugar, a Grécia: não reescrevamos a História.
Em primeiro lugar, a Itália opôs-se à imposição de sanções, depois a França reconheceu o Conselho de Transição em Bengasi sem proceder a quaisquer consultas e, por último, a Alemanha absteve-se na votação do Conselho de Segurança de ONU. A senhora não pode fazer nada para mudar esta situação que, no entanto, dá uma imagem negativa da Europa. É claro que deveríamos ter imposto sanções mais fortes à Síria, mas também aí necessitávamos de unanimidade.
Em primeiro lugar, a UE deve definir os seus interesses estratégicos comuns, por exemplo, no que respeita à segurança energética e à política de vizinhança. Em segundo lugar, a UE deve aumentar a sua capacidade de planificação e coordenação da gestão de operações e crises civis e militares.
Em primeiro lugar, a adesão da Rússia à Organização Mundial do Comércio. A adesão da Rússia à OMC e o livre comércio são do interesse quer da UE quer da Rússia.
Em primeiro lugar, a articulação entre Fundo de Coesão e o Programa-Quadro de Investigação deve ser melhorada.
Em primeiro lugar, a atenção dada à educação e à formação profissional. São os jovens quem vai criar e participar no futuro da UE. Assim, é especialmente importante que sejam empreendedores e estejam aptos a criar uma economia europeia vibrante e competitiva. A utilização eficiente dos recursos é outro aspecto relacionado com a qualidade de vida na UE, no futuro. É um tema recorrente, mas, até agora, infelizmente pouco fizemos para levar as nossas palavras à prática.
Em primeiro lugar, a avaliação mostrou-nos, e não podemos esquecê-lo, que continua a existir uma excessiva concentração na distribuição dos Fundos de Investigação. Alguns países e alguns centros e unidades de investigação e grandes indústrias conseguem ceder muito mais facilmente aos fundos de investigação do que outros. Nós não podemos pactuar com este modelo.
Em primeiro lugar, a criação de uma categoria de "regiões intermédias" no âmbito da política de coesão para assegurar uma distribuição dos fundos estruturais que corresponda melhor às realidades económicas e sociais dos territórios; e, em segundo lugar, o apelo renovado à criação de um imposto sobre as transacções financeiras, enquanto novo recurso para a salvaguarda das políticas económicas europeias.
Em primeiro lugar, a ideia consiste em ligar o desenvolvimento e a inovação mediante a congregação de todos instrumentos relevantes da UE num quadro estratégico comum que permita a introdução de estratégias verdadeiramente transversais que abranjam toda gama de sistemas de inovação, desde a investigação ao desenvolvimento tecnológico, demonstração e mercado.
Em primeiro lugar, a inovação. O Parlamento comprometeu-se a promover a inovação, mas não pode fazê-lo em detrimento da investigação fundamental.
Em primeiro lugar, a política proteccionista do Japão no sector automóvel preocupa-nos, pois existe um desequilíbrio entre as exportações e as importações. Em segundo lugar, queremos levantar a questão das barreiras não pautais.
Em primeiro lugar, a promoção e a revitalização do património cultural local, que pode ser linguístico, musical, arquitectónico ou artístico no sentido mais lato, com o objectivo de preservar a diversidade e a individualidade dos horizontes intelectuais na era da generalização, ou melhor, da banalização e da desvalorização da mensagem cultural.
Em primeiro lugar, a proposta sublinha que as avaliações de impacto devem ter em devida conta o impacto das novas regulamentações sobre as pequenas e médias empresas e a redução do respectivo ónus administrativo. A ênfase dada às necessidades das PME foi determinante para me decidir a votar a favor.
Em primeiro lugar, a questão de saber se é de incluir um capítulo sobre o desenvolvimento sustentável. O presente acordo de comércio livre é um acordo de nova geração, logo, é perfeitamente natural que inclua um capítulo sobre essa matéria.
Em primeiro lugar, a revisão da Política Europeia de Vizinhança, nomeadamente a sua dimensão mediterrânica, deve reflectir-se no orçamento. E para começar, Senhor Comissário, a proposta da Comissão relativamente à Palestina, ao processo de paz no Médio Oriente e à UNRWA (Agência das Nações Unidas de Socorro e Trabalho para os Refugiados da Palestina) sugere um corte orçamental de 100 milhões de euros.
Em primeiro lugar, ao contrário do que acontece noutras matérias, a opinião pública europeia é 65-70% favorável a uma política externa e de segurança comum.
Em primeiro lugar, apesar da sua dimensão, não consigo encontrar em nenhum ponto deste relatório uma única tentativa séria de fazer propostas para realizar economias estruturais como, por exemplo, a abolição de organismos que são, a meu ver, instituições europeias totalmente supérfluas, como o Comité Económico e Social, o Comité das Regiões e uma série de agências europeias de todos os tipos.
Em primeiro lugar, as economias fortes e as fracas são reunidas arbitrariamente no mesmo grupo.
Em primeiro lugar, as novas Autoridades Europeias de Supervisão devem ser financiadas de forma satisfatória. A sua capacidade para desempenhar um papel cada vez mais importante é crucial para a estabilidade nos mercados financeiros.
Em primeiro lugar, concordo em absoluto com a necessidade de intensificar o diálogo entre o mercado de trabalho e o sistema educativo através do aumento do número de estágios disponíveis nas empresas, para permitir que os estudantes participem activamente no mundo empresarial e para reforçar as relações entre as empresas e as instituições de ensino em matéria de formação profissional.
Em primeiro lugar, considero importantíssimo promover a mobilidade. É um meio de aprendizagem informal e extremamente valioso, que promove o intercâmbio cultural e proporciona aos jovens os instrumentos necessários para se desenvolverem num ambiente profissional global.
Em primeiro lugar, cumpre referir a afectação das receitas provenientes das taxas rodoviárias ao investimento na melhoria das infra-estruturas de transporte, o que é de interesse económico para as populações e proporciona maior segurança e melhores rotas de transporte.
Em primeiro lugar, debruçar-me-ei sobre o relatório do senhor deputado Pieper.
Em primeiro lugar, deve o teste de esforço ser aplicado a todos os bancos? Em segundo lugar, poderemos ter a certeza de que os testes de esforço irão, daqui em diante, reflectir a situação verdadeira dos bancos? E, em terceiro lugar, que autoridade possui a Autoridade Bancária Europeia para impor a sua autoridade sobre os bancos faltosos, sobre os bancos que estão sobreexpostos, sobre os bancos que exibem uma conduta irresponsável, etc?
Em primeiro lugar, e uma vez que o principal objectivo é a erradicação da pobreza, é necessário atribuir à causa fundos realmente novos: não devem ser retirados de projectos já em curso.
Em primeiro lugar, em relação à implementação dos programas, o montante total indicado dos projectos seleccionados é de 93,4 mil milhões de euros, o que representa mais de 27% dos recursos da UE disponíveis no período em questão. O que pode considerar-se bastante razoável, tendo em conta não só o contexto de grave deterioração da situação socioeconómica em 2008-2009 devido à crise global, mas também a reforma da política para o período de 2007-2013.
Em primeiro lugar, estamos perante um relatório completo e abrangente que aborda de um modo construtivo as questões fundamentais levantadas pela avaliação intercalar do 7PQ. É muito encorajador ver que o relatório da avaliação intercalar suscitou respostas significativas das instituições e que estas respostas, embora pondo por vezes a tónica em questões diferentes, estão basicamente em conformidade com as conclusões e recomendações principais expressas pelos peritos da avaliação independente.
Em primeiro lugar, estaríamos a permitir uma rápida mobilização de recursos para a reconstrução ou consolidação do Estado.
Em primeiro lugar, evitar a fragmentação do mercado interno no que se refere aos serviços financeiros, dado que estão a ser postas em prática cada vez mais medidas orçamentais de carácter nacional não coordenadas.
Em primeiro lugar, gostaria de agradecer a todos os senhores deputados este debate muito substancial e útil, que reflecte um sentido geral de responsabilidade pelo futuro económico da Europa, pelo crescimento e a estabilidade, e pelo bem-estar dos nossos cidadãos.
Em primeiro lugar, gostaria de assinalar que, até este momento, o Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento não estava inscrito no orçamento ordinário da UE. Tal facto é verdadeiramente inaceitável porque interfere com o controlo democrático, resulta numa falta de responsabilidade e seguramente não contribui para a transparência do financiamento.
Em primeiro lugar, gostaria de dizer ao senhor Secretário de Estado que penso que já provámos que o método comunitário funciona.
Em primeiro lugar, gostaria de lhe pedir, Senhor Deputado, que se informasse junto dos seus colegas da Comissão dos Assuntos Económicos e Monetários acerca do trabalho desenvolvido pelo Ministro da Economia Nacional, György Matolcsy, uma vez que o ambiente vivido ontem durante o inquérito foi ligeiramente diferente daquele que nos descreveu aqui hoje.
Em primeiro lugar, muitos dos reguladores em matéria de segurança nuclear não concordavam com um procedimento de inspecção europeu.
Em primeiro lugar, necessitamos de uma base muito mais sólida para a condição de uma verificação de proporcionalidade, para que não sejam abrangidos delitos menores.
Em primeiro lugar, nenhuma redução dos compromissos orçamentais para a política de coesão. O Senhor Comissário Hahn deve poder contar, para elaborar a sua programação 2014-2020, com os mesmos montantes orçamentais com que contou no passado.
Em primeiro lugar, no actual contexto internacional de austeridade, o orçamento europeu, que não tem défice, não pode ser culpado pela má gestão das finanças nacionais.
Em primeiro lugar, no que diz respeito à fuga de carbono, a Comissão gostaria de sublinhar que, na mais recente alteração da Directiva RCLE, o Parlamento Europeu e o Conselho decidiram abordar esta questão atribuindo uma quota maior de licenças gratuitas a sectores e subsectores considerados expostos a um risco significativo de fuga de carbono.
Em primeiro lugar, normas mínimas sobre o direito a interpretação e a tradução, já adoptadas em 2010.
Em primeiro lugar, não o faremos com mais Europa nem com mais fundos para a Europa, mas com melhor Europa, uma Europa com valor acrescentado e uma Europa que não interfira em questões que, como o desporto ou o turismo, os Estados-Membros podem perfeitamente tratar de forma autónoma.
Em primeiro lugar, o facto de se analisarem os regulamentos ou as directivas existentes para ver se estão realmente a funcionar bem na prática ou a atingir os seus objectivos e de serem posteriormente melhorados ou interpretados de forma mais precisa onde for necessário não é um argumento contra a política europeia, mas sim um argumento a favor dessa política.
Em primeiro lugar, o princípio básico é que nós não pretendemos regular todos os pormenores do conceito fundamental de subsidiariedade. À partida, a posição de cada Estado-Membro é diferente da dos outros.
Em primeiro lugar, o princípio do pluralismo dos meios de comunicação. A análise do sistema de gestão das frequências de rádio a nível europeu é extremamente importante, e penso que devemos evitar claramente a acumulação de direitos de frequência e a criação de monopólios ou oligopólios, os quais existem, infelizmente, em alguns países europeus e estão a tornar-se mais fortes e a entrar no sector da radiodifusão.
Em primeiro lugar, os Chefes de Estado e de Governo devem recuperar a governação, porque não têm sido apenas os Chefes de Estado ou de Governo a decidir.
Em primeiro lugar, os partidos europeus são, como a senhora deputada sabe, reconhecidos como entidades relevantes pelo Tratado que foi ratificado por unanimidade pelos nossos Estados-Membros.
Em primeiro lugar, os primeiros anos de infância são cruciais para o desenvolvimento cognitivo, sensorial e motor da criança. Por conseguinte, no desenvolvimento de programas e de políticas gerais no domínio dos cuidados e da educação na primeira infância, os Estados-Membros devem atender a um conjunto de questões que afectam o sector dos serviços à primeira infância, tais como a migração, a igualdade entre os géneros e o emprego.
Em primeiro lugar, para alcançar os nossos objectivos de um sistema de transportes mais sustentável e ecológico e, assim, implementar o princípio do "poluidor-pagador". A Directiva autorizará os Estados-Membros a cobrar portagens aos camiões não só pela utilização das infra-estruturas, como é o caso agora, mas também pela poluição atmosférica e sonora.
Em primeiro lugar, para que a PAC possa contribuir para a realização dos objectivos da Europa 2020, é preciso manter orçamento agrícola da União Europeia para o próximo período de financiamento pelo menos ao mesmo nível do orçamento agrícola de 2013.
Em primeiro lugar, para voltar de imediato à questão levantada mesmo agora pela senhora deputada Gáll-Pelcz, que falou sobre a responsabilidade da Comissão - tenho por hábito encarar as minhas responsabilidades -, gostaria de salientar que estes testes de esforço que estão a ser empreendidos hoje foram concebidos e são da responsabilidade da nova autoridade que criámos em conjunto, a Autoridade Bancária Europeia.
Em primeiro lugar, penso que se trata de uma proposta importante.
Em primeiro lugar, permitam-me começar pela nossa clarificação do pacote de asilo, uma vez que recebi muitas questões concretas a esse respeito.
Em primeiro lugar, por exigir contas sobre as ajudas que os Estados-Membros concedem aos fabricantes de veículos de mercadorias de pequena tonelagem.
Em primeiro lugar, porque o relatório preconiza reforçar o papel do Parlamento Europeu, nos termos dos novos poderes que lhe confere o Tratado de Lisboa no que respeita à conclusão de acordos internacionais com países terceiros. A este respeito, o relatório salienta a necessidade de intensificar o diálogo com a Comissão nas diferentes fases de negociação e acompanhamento dos acordos em vigor.
Em primeiro lugar, precisamos de um mercado das telecomunicações a favor da concorrência e a funcionar bem a nível europeu.
Em primeiro lugar, queria dizer que espero deste Conselho Europeu, especialmente com o clima que se está a viver nestas últimas semanas, uma decisão de grande responsabilidade. E de mais responsabilidade do que daquela que existiu no último Conselho, em que se procurou adiar um problema por três meses, apenas por causa de calendários eleitorais.
Em primeiro lugar, quero expressar a minha satisfação com o facto de a minha posição, apoiada por uma alteração à resolução sobre o relatório de acompanhamento de 2010 relativo à Croácia, apresentada em conjunto com o meu colega, senhor deputado Bernd Posselt, estar em vias de se tornar uma realidade.
Em primeiro lugar, quero saudar o facto de haver uma estrutura de dois pilares, porque penso que isso é consensual.
Em primeiro lugar, tal como desejavam, os testes de esforço para 2011 foram objecto de verdadeiras melhorias, especialmente em seis áreas que gostaria de vos referir brevemente.
Em primeiro lugar, temos de garantir aos cidadãos níveis máximos de certeza e segurança. A União Europeia deve ter os melhores critérios do mundo e exercer influência sobre as autoridades internacionais de molde a que, no quadro da governação mundial emergente, os habitantes de todo o planeta possam ter a certeza de que estão a ser aplicados os critérios de segurança mais rigorosos em função do avanço do conhecimento científico. É necessário igualmente fazer cessar toda a comercialização das centrais nucleares de baixo custo.
Em primeiro lugar, temos de melhorar o acesso ao crédito e à ajuda financeira; necessitamos de mais investimento em investigação e desenvolvimento científicos; regras claras que ofereçam perspectivas a longo prazo em termos de inovação; procedimentos simplificados para aceder a programas de apoio europeus e nacionais; e patentes europeias baratas e simples.
Em primeiro lugar, temos de procurar a origem do surto e averiguar se continuam a ser exercidas práticas inadequadas no sector da produção de géneros alimentícios ou na cadeia de abastecimento alimentar.
Em primeiro lugar, trata-se aqui sobretudo de incorporar novos objectivos políticos, como sejam as alterações climáticas, a biodiversidade, a energia, as redes transeuropeias e a política de coesão. Em segundo lugar, têm de ser incluídos os acórdãos do Tribunal de Justiça da União Europeia, de que resultou uma importante clarificação da questão. Em resposta à pergunta do senhor deputado Lichtenberger, gostaria de dizer que estabelecemos que neste momento a Lei austríaca relativa à AIA cumpre os requisitos em termos de limiares.
Em primeiro lugar, à Comissão: relativamente a Schengen, a Comissão quer um mecanismo comunitário para a tomada de decisão colectiva, quer deixar para trás o intergovernamentalismo, quer impedir o oportunismo político que temos visto por parte da Itália e da França. Por isso, por favor não tornem a mensagem ambígua na declaração. Deixem claro que proibirão e evitarão esse tipo de oportunismo que acabará por pôr fim a Schengen.
Em primeiro lugar, é importante perceber que é necessário manter o equilíbrio institucional consagrado no Tratado, em cujos termos a Comissão Europeia propõe leis, e o Parlamento e o Conselho aprovam-nas.
Em primeiro lugar, é necessário que tanto a Comissão como o Parlamento reflictam atentamente, em conjunto com o Conselho, sobre a melhor maneira de definir e delinear no quadro legislativo a responsabilidade dos diferentes actores financeiros. O facto de o Tribunal de Contas e a Comissão detectarem erros sobretudo em projectos e pagamentos geridos pelos Estados-Membros indica claramente os pontos em que é necessário realizar rapidamente mais esforços, dado que a gestão partilhada representa quase 80% dos fundos europeus.
Em primeiro lugar, é possível observar grandes semelhanças entre Estados-Membros no que respeita à dívidas pública e ao rácio do défice, enquanto, ao mesmo tempo e para os mesmos Estados-Membros, existem diferenças substanciais entre os prémios de risco pagos sobre a respectiva dívida soberana.
Em primeiro lugar: a União Europeia tentará incentivar a Rússia a resolver as últimas questões multilaterais pendentes para facilitar a adesão à OMC antes do final de 2011, com base no acordo bilateral UE-Rússia alcançado em 2004 e em Dezembro passado. A Rússia ainda poderá concretizar a adesão à OMC antes do final de 2011 se conseguir adoptar as medidas necessárias para resolver a meia dúzia de questões a nível multilateral que se encontram pendentes. A cimeira não pode substituir as negociações em Genebra, mas pode instar a Rússia a tomar medidas construtivas.
Em primeiro lugar: as eleições. As autoridades russas estão bem cientes de que a União Europeia acompanhará os processos eleitorais de 2011 e 2012 com muita atenção. Se existirem irregularidades nas próximas eleições, essas questões terão de ser abordadas.
Em princípio, as pequenas e médias empresas também são responsáveis por inovações, por exemplo, no desenvolvimento de produtos e nos domínios da administração, dos serviços e do marketing, cobrindo vários níveis diferentes.
Em princípio, o Tratado de Lisboa deveria contribuir para a Europa encontrar uma só voz em matéria de política externa, mas na semana passada tivemos mais uma prova da falta de coesão na política externa da União: depois de Osama bin Laden ter sido morto na passada segunda-feira, os Chefes de Estado da UE emitiram nada mais nada menos do que cinco declarações diferentes no espaço de 24 horas.
Em princípio, os critérios de eficiência e desempenho de uma agência constam do seu plano anual de trabalho, juntamente com uma indicação das maneiras como tais critérios serão abordados. O plano anual de trabalho de uma agência tem de ser aprovado pelo seu conselho directivo e é apresentado à comissão competente do Parlamento Europeu.
Em qualquer caso, as cidades da Europa são centros de actividade económica, inovação e emprego, pelo que é importante apoiá-las, especialmente em tempos de recessão económica. O relatório, a favor do qual votei, conclui, e bem, que tal apoio tem de ser prestado a quatro níveis (UE, nacional, regional e local), através do recurso aos instrumentos económicos e políticos respectivos disponíveis em cada caso (fundos comunitários, programas estratégicos nacionais, programas operacionais regionais e recursos locais e privados).
Em quarto e último lugar, não esqueçamos os agricultores que acabaram por ficar lesados: foram, sem nada terem feito para isso, alvo de suspeições que se revelaram falsas.
Em quarto lugar, a par de todas as preocupações de natureza cultural, social e religiosa e em matéria de política externa, a adesão da Turquia faria pesar um fardo enorme sobre o Fundo de Coesão. Em termos realistas, faria explodir o orçamento.
Em quarto lugar, a senhora deputada Bowles e outros oradores questionaram-nos sobre as diferenças de cobertura do sector bancário no seio da União. A Autoridade Bancária esforçou-se no sentido de desenvolver uma amostra suficientemente representativa, tanto a nível nacional como a nível de toda a União Europeia, assegurando simultaneamente que o exercício permaneça exequível.
Em quarto lugar, e este é o último ponto do projecto de relatório que gostaria de referir hoje, há os instrumentos de engenharia financeira. Já muito se disse sobre o tópico JESSICA.
Em quarto lugar, há a necessidade de contribuir também para o desenvolvimento do Norte, que não podemos esquecer, e que se prepara para redigir uma nova Constituição.
Em quarto lugar, não podemos aceitar um acordo que não aborda as diferentes normas e preferências das PME locais e dos monopólios estatais, no Canadá. Esta foi uma questão que o senhor deputado Papastamkos levantou acerca das diferenças entre as regulamentações provincial e federal.
Em quarto lugar, o SBA também criou um quadro para permitir que as PME possam responder ao desafio da eficiência energética, melhorando a sua gestão de energia e aproveitando as oportunidades oferecidas pelo mercado ambiental. O plano de acção para fomentar a eco-inovação também será implementado, prestando uma atenção especial às PME, através da promoção do estabelecimento de redes, de tecnologias hipercarbónicas e da gestão eficiente da utilização dos recursos.
Em quarto lugar, quero uma garantia da parte da Comissão de que será levada a cabo uma investigação transparente e independente para apurar os factos e, assim, percebermos o que correu mal. Só após conhecermos os factos é que poderemos tomar medidas para colmatar quaisquer lacunas na legislação em matéria de segurança alimentar.
Em quarto lugar, temos de vigiar a formação de engenheiros nucleares e acelerar programas de investigação científica e, quanto a isso, gostaria de manifestar a minha satisfação com o facto de o Sétimo Programa-Quadro da Comunidade da Energia Atómica (Euratom) ter sido prolongado até 2012 e 2013.
Em quarto lugar: iremos promover os direitos humanos e o Estado de direito na Rússia.
Em que medida saberemos agir correctamente no nosso próprio terreno? Trata-se de uma prova que temos de vencer com êxito e com dignidade.
Em quinto lugar, é importante proceder a um inventário eficiente da utilização do espectro, parte essencial da construção de um programa político eficaz e previdente.
Em regiões como aquela em que nos encontramos, aqui em Estrasburgo ou na Alsácia de um modo geral, a vida numa região fronteiriça deixou de estar limitada pelas fronteiras, e os benefícios vão muito além destas regiões de fronteira.
Em relação a este aspecto, gostaria, contudo, de colocar à Comissão a seguinte pergunta: a criação de uma nova estrutura resolve sempre o problema em causa ou podíamos, neste caso, responder a desafios semelhantes desenvolvendo o actual sistema de introdução ou supressão progressiva dos fundos (phasing in, phasing out)?
Em relação ao Modo 4, impõe-se resolver os problemas relacionados com o reconhecimento das qualificações profissionais, questão que, todavia, é particularmente complexa, atendendo a que até mesmo entre os Estados-Membros da União Europeia temos problemas em matéria de reconhecimento mútuo das qualificações profissionais.
Em relação ao Parlamento, consideramos importante que utilizemos efectivamente as avaliações de impacto como um instrumento.
Em relação ao debate sobre o surto de EHEC nos Estados-Membros da UE, permita-me que chame a atenção para o facto de, na sequência das decisões de países comunitários e não comunitários, algumas fronteiras terem sido encerradas para proteger o mercado de um fluxo de produtos hortícolas de países que alojam a suposta fonte de infecção. A informação que recebemos dos produtores de hortícolas é preocupante.
Em relação ao ensino e à formação profissionais, é necessário que os Estados-Membros tenham em consideração as necessidades específicas dos trabalhadores pouco qualificados, dos aprendentes de origem migrante, das pessoas pertencentes a minorias étnicas, das mulheres vulneráveis, dos desempregados e das pessoas com deficiência.
Em relação ao imposto financeiro, quero confirmar que a proposta que a Comissão apresentará, provavelmente em Outubro, dirá respeito a um imposto sobre as transacções financeiras.
Em relação ao orçamento de 2012, gostaria de salientar que o projecto de orçamento, aprovado pela Comissão a 20 de Abril, está de acordo com as conclusões do Conselho Europeu de 24 e 25 de Março, que estipula que os esforços de consolidação fiscal têm de ser acompanhados por reformas estruturais que fomentem o crescimento.
Em relação aos que perderam a vida, esta não lhes pode ser restituída. Poderemos talvez, a longo prazo, corrigir a situação subjacente, mas está à vista quão errado é saltar para conclusões numa fase muito precoce.
Em relação com o que atrás ficou dito, penso que o relatório Sanchez-Schmid sobre um desafio para a cooperação territorial - a futura agenda de cooperação transfronteiras, transnacional e inter-regional - constitui um importante contributo para o trabalho sobre política regional e votei a favor da sua aprovação.
Em relação à directiva relativa aos resíduos nucleares, gostaria de dizer que teremos mais oportunidades do que as que referiu no seu discurso para a debatermos da próxima vez, e espero que a Comissão Europeia leve em consideração as propostas do Parlamento Europeu, porque, na Comissão da Indústria, da Investigação e da Energia, votámos a favor de várias propostas mais fortes do que as que foram propostas originalmente pela Comissão Europeia.
Em relação à nossa vizinhança imediata do outro lado do Mediterrâneo, estamos a procurar incluir nas parcerias para a mobilidade todos os aspectos de protecção de asilo internacional irregular e legal relativos à migração.
Em relação à política de acção externa, e uma vez que tenho já pouco tempo, queria dizer aqui que a União Europeia tem uma oportunidade única para desenvolver um tipo de política externa completamente diferente da que desenvolvem os Estados-Membros. E, no seu aspecto cultural, isto não tem a ver com criar uma potencial identidade europeia e ilusória identidade europeia e depois exportá-la ou vendê-la ao estrangeiro.
Em relação à primeira, mostrámos, na síntese que apresentámos e no debate que se seguiu, que os órgãos de poder regional e local e a sociedade civil não estão suficientemente envolvidos na concepção, execução e desenvolvimento do planeamento regional, isto é, na utilização dos instrumentos da política de coesão. Por outro lado, aludimos às dificuldades decorrentes da rigidez do financiamento.
Em relação à questão global que coloca, também foi discutida a situação na Zona Euro. Aí temos talvez pontos de vista completamente diferentes. Nós entendemos que, sem uma consolidação orçamental e sem reformas estruturais, não haverá hipótese de promover os nossos objectivos: uma economia social de mercado.
Em relação à sua pergunta, dizia-lhe que estas medidas de austeridade vão ser cumpridas pelos portugueses e que, não obstante ser um pacote duro, pesado, nós vamos de tudo fazer para aumentar o crescimento económico, criar mais emprego e sair destas dificuldades.
Em relação às notícias publicadas na imprensa sobre a intenção do senhor Durão Barroso, Presidente da Comissão, de reduzir substancialmente os fundos afectos ao desenvolvimento rural, gostaria de dizer muito claramente que se a Comissão reduzir os programas de desenvolvimento rural irá privar as zonas rurais da sua subsistência A realização de cortes ao nível do segundo pilar afectaria drasticamente estruturas agrícolas eficientes. O senhor Durão Barroso faria bem em atender às advertências desta Assembleia.
Em resposta a isto, os Verdes propõem um acordo sobre prosperidade viável: convergência fiscal integrada, um orçamento europeu verdadeiramente intervencionista e ambicioso e a integração das dimensões social e ambiental. É por isto que desejamos abrir o caminho para avançar numa direcção diferente.
Em resposta ao outro senhor deputado, estamos neste momento a negociar o quadro, por isso não estou em condições de lhe dar quaisquer números.
Em resposta à primeira pergunta, em 2009 a Comissão solicitou à Agência Europeia de Medicamentos (EMA) que assumisse a responsabilidade da recolha de dados comparáveis sobre a utilização de agentes antimicrobianos em animais.
Em resposta à primeira pergunta, o acesso a zonas da Líbia onde estão a decorrer operações militares é limitado mas ainda assim - graças à coragem dos trabalhadores humanitários - conseguimos chegar a duas populações afectadas em Misrata assim como a cidades contestadas na zona costeira. A zona onde não conseguimos chegar às populações afectadas é a parte ocidental da Líbia sob o controlo de Khadafi.
Em resposta, a OSCE afirmou que o processo eleitoral na sua generalidade não tinha sido suficiente para constituir uma evolução significativa no sentido do progresso democrático do país. O relatório da OSCE referiu igualmente que a liberdade de expressão era limitada e que o discurso político normal era quase impossível, em parte devido a grandes restrições aos meios de comunicação.
Em resultado desta legislação, entre outras coisas, o mercado foi fortemente abalado, dado que o número de animais abatidos caiu de 210 000 em 2008 para 38 000 este ano, tendo o preço das peles caído de 100 dólares em 2006 para 15 dólares em 2009. O Canadá tenta agora penetrar em novos mercados, por exemplo na China, mas também aí se ouvem vozes que apelam à proibição do comércio desse produtos. É também lamentável, portanto, que o Canadá continue a tentar combater esta legislação europeia por via da OMC.
Em resultado directo, as PME e os consumidores tendem a realizar transacções no mercado interno, frequentemente muito menos competitivo, pelo que não têm acesso ao mercado transfronteiriço, em que os produtos são muitas vezes no mínimo 10% mais baratos do que na oferta nacional.
Em resultado, a Comissão Europeia publicou um Livro Verde sobre esta matéria e iniciou uma ampla consulta pública.
Em resumo, congratulo-me com o relatório e com o trabalho que foi realizado, mas tenho algumas preocupações com a atenção que, ao que parece, dedicámos a uma política que poderia ter confirmado o chamado "abandono gradual” que estamos habituados a ver.
Em resumo, o orçamento europeu deve ser utilizado sempre que fizer a diferença, pois tem a natureza de um investimento e não tem défice.
Em resumo, à luz dos enormes problemas económicos com que as economias europeias estão confrontadas, o relatório não demonstra o mínimo vestígio de compreensão do que é uma gestão orçamental prudente. "Estende o pé à medida do lençol" é uma sugestão melhor do que este apelo indesejável a mais e novos recursos.
Em reuniões diárias com peritos do Estado-Membro coordenámos medidas de avaliação: estabelecemos definições comuns de casos, normas para a notificação de casos, preparámos questionários a preencher pelos pacientes, procedemos a partilha de perspectivas de tratamento e demos ao público conselhos relativos à higiene.
Em seguida, com a entrada em funcionamento do 8º PQ deveríamos reforçar a supervisão e a avaliação ex post dos resultados das actividades de investigação e de inovação com financiamento comunitário.
Em segundo lugar, Schengen precisa de solidariedade, e a solidariedade também é a partilha de responsabilidades - a partilha de encargos - e a partilha de responsabilidades também está relacionada com a dimensão do Estado-Membro.
Em segundo lugar, a Comissão Europeia avaliou pormenorizadamente os custos e benefícios da redução das emissões de CO2 para a economia europeia, no âmbito do chamado pacote "Clima e Energia", acordado em 2008.
Em segundo lugar, a Grécia. A Grécia percorreu um longo caminho desde a situação extremamente difícil do ano passado e há que louvar os seus esforços. Viu-se confrontada com um desafio colossal e demonstrou um empenho inabalável e uma clareza de propósitos.
Em segundo lugar, a UE e a Rússia têm um interesse comum vital na região do Árctico. A UE precisa de reforçar a sua política para o Árctico.
Em segundo lugar, a democracia tem a ver, naturalmente, com votos e eleições - mas vai muito para além disso.
Em segundo lugar, a eliminação - tal como já foi referido - das barreiras regulamentares e administrativas que impedem a livre circulação, no espaço Schengen, de agentes do sector cultural, em particular, de cidadãos de países terceiros, através da adopção, por exemplo, de procedimentos comuns acelerados na União Europeia para vistos de curta e longa duração, bem como de um procedimento único de pedido de autorização de trabalho na União. Exorto a Comissão a continuar o seu trabalho nestes domínios.
Em segundo lugar, a execução do Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento compete aos Africanos, que são donos do Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento juntamente com a União Europeia.
Em segundo lugar, a lei relativa à Avaliação do Impacto Ambiental (AIA) na Áustria necessita ser alterada ou alargada para assegurar que corresponda às directivas da União Europeia, ou, por outras palavras, aos vossos requisitos.
Em segundo lugar, a situação que está a ser vivida pelos cidadãos gregos - e, na verdade, por muitos outros países na Europa - é consequência de muitos anos a viver acima das suas possibilidades.
Em segundo lugar, aceitará que as circunstâncias enfrentadas em Fukushima foram absolutamente extraordinárias e sem precedentes, quer no que se refere à força do terramoto - o mais forte já vivido no Japão -, quer no que toca à dimensão do tsunami, que atingiu um máximo, segundo me disseram, de 46 metros, com uma altura média de 14 metros, condições que não serão de esperar na Europa?
Em segundo lugar, acima de qualquer debate sobre os erros e a má gestão do Governo grego, temos de ter presente que, na avaliação que os nossos concidadãos gregos fizeram das políticas propostas e aplicadas pela Europa para fazer frente à crise, dizem-nos que têm limites, e pedem-nos que não os forcemos para lá desses limites. É preciso dar respostas claras e específicas a estas mensagens. Só dessa forma é que a ajuda da Europa para fazer frente à crise poderá levar os nossos concidadãos a ter uma visão de futuro e esperança.
Em segundo lugar, afirma-se no relatório que as línguas de trabalho da União são o francês, o inglês e o alemão. Isso não é correcto. São as 23 línguas da União Europeia, base da nossa riqueza e diversidade.
Em segundo lugar, as orientações juridicamente não vinculativas a nível da UE poderiam apoiar e facilitar a implementação e o controlo da aplicação do Regulamento relativo à Transferência de Resíduos, especialmente por parte dos funcionários aduaneiros, e contribuir, assim, para combater as actividades ilícitas.
Em segundo lugar, as políticas de investigação e inovação devem ser adaptadas às necessidades específicas do mercado. A procura de tecnologias inovadoras no mercado da UE deve ser identificada a fim de vender os resultados da inovação. Creio que se deverá dispor de instrumentos financeiros adequados para apoiar uma boa introdução de tecnologias inovadoras no mercado da UE.
Em segundo lugar, até 2013, a Comissão Europeia deverá apresentar uma avaliação de impacto sobre a introdução de etiquetagem, indicando claramente que vestuário foi produzido na Europa ou fora da Europa.
Em segundo lugar, censuro veementemente todas as condenações baseadas na acusação de participação em distúrbios massivos, e considero-as de cariz político e de natureza questionável.
Em segundo lugar, considero importante que realizemos um "teste PME" em relação a todas as avaliações de impacto e que examinemos as consequências para a competitividade industrial na Europa.
Em segundo lugar, devemos exigir que a Alemanha envide todos os esforços para localizar a origem da bactéria. A propósito, saúdo a decisão da Comissão de enviar peritos para a Alemanha. O trabalho da Comissão tem, no entanto, de se desenvolver a uma escala mais alargada; há que verificar se todos os sistemas de controlo, análise e investigação funcionaram devidamente. É necessário melhorar e reforçar os nossos mecanismos de alerta alimentar.
Em segundo lugar, devemos garantir o acesso às informações que servem de base às decisões das agências de notação de crédito, que as mesmas são compreensíveis, e que os modelos utilizados são também conhecidos.
Em segundo lugar, e em estreita ligação com a mobilidade, é fundamental que os jovens aprendam outras línguas europeias, com dois objectivos: para que interajam fluentemente no ambiente europeu e para que estejam plenamente integrados nas comunidades onde vivem e trabalham, isto é, em prol da coesão social.
Em segundo lugar, e isto é particularmente importante para nós: no futuro, teremos muitos acordos europeus comuns que se aplicarão aos 27 Estados-Membros e aos investidores destes Estados-Membros, isto se quisermos ter também um nível uniforme de protecção no mercado interno europeu.
Em segundo lugar, em relação ao próprio relato estratégico: é uma ferramenta para se reflectir estrategicamente, e se discutir, sobre a dimensão temática da política de coesão com base em provas concretas fornecidas pelos Estados-Membros. O relato estratégico é também uma avaliação do processo em curso. É levado a cabo durante o período de programação para proporcionar uma visão geral do progresso dos Estados-Membros na concretização dos objectivos da UE, e uma base útil para melhorar o desempenho. O relatório salienta assim um grande número de boas práticas capazes de ajudar a melhorar a qualidade do exercício de relato, reforçando a apropriação das partes interessadas nos Estados-Membros, e melhorando, no fim de contas, a eficiência da implementação.
Em segundo lugar, espero que os Chefes de Estado e de Governo aprovem as recomendações específicas para cada país que a Comissão apresentou em 7 de Junho.
Em segundo lugar, estará a crise da dívida pública europeia a deteriorar-se aos nossos olhos, tal como refere o Senhor Giegold? Esta deterioração será apenas verificada durante os testes de esforço em curso através do exame às carteiras de negociação. Contudo, os títulos em poder dos bancos até ao respectivo vencimento final constam das carteiras de títulos em poder do banco. Não obstante, a carteira do banco não será abrangida pelo teste de esforço. Como justifica Vossa Excelência esta distinção?
Em segundo lugar, este mesmo Parlamento, à excepção de uma pequena minoria eurocéptica, apoia uma acção federal europeia, principalmente no domínio da política externa e de segurança.
Em segundo lugar, existe uma certa relutância em que nos concentremos em projectos prioritários, ou em falar da taxa de erro relativa a esses projectos.
Em segundo lugar, expliquei durante o debate e explicarei mais uma vez que retirei uma lição desta situação. Percebo agora que precisamos de fazer mais para impor normas de segurança mais rigorosas às centrais nucleares europeias. É preciso que exerçamos mais pressão e mostremos maior capacidade de iniciativa.
Em segundo lugar, fico absolutamente assustado com as sugestões repetidas de que a UE deve cobrar impostos próprios ou emitir títulos de dívida pública europeus, que, mais cedo ou mais tarde, terão de ser pagos por alguém. A sugestão, incluída no relatório, de que medidas deste tipo não aumentariam a carga fiscal total imposta aos cidadãos é uma mentira, evidentemente, e um logro da pior espécie.
Em segundo lugar, gostaria de dizer que, como sabemos, o óptimo é inimigo do bom. A exigência absolutamente legítima de transparência, como reflectida no debate e na votação de hoje, deve, necessariamente, ser equilibrada para que, embora com a melhor das intenções, não destruamos um sistema que funciona bem. A exigência de transparência total, um registo obrigatório de tudo o que existe, um comité de controle ético e assim por diante, são, na melhor das hipóteses, a expressão de algo ingénuo e, na pior das hipóteses, parte de uma agenda política populista que trará mais prejuízos do que benefícios.
Em segundo lugar, gostaria de responder à senhora deputada Swinburne. É tempo de responder francamente àqueles que, como a senhora, Senhora Deputada Swinburne, e como o senhor, Senhor Deputado Farage, continuam a veicular a ideia errónea de que nós, europeus, poderemos exercer algum peso nas questões mundiais - que também nos afectam - falando a múltiplas vozes.
Em segundo lugar, gostaria de salientar que a melhoria da qualidade na aplicação dos fundos não deve ser apenas uma prioridade importante da União Europeia, mas também uma prioridade realista. É preciso que haja progressos claros e mais céleres no desenvolvimento de sistemas de gestão e controlo eficazes nos Estados-Membros, reduzindo o nível de risco de erro e simplificando os requisitos e regras.
Em segundo lugar, gostaria de salientar que, se quisermos que toda essa abordagem para a segurança pública seja credível, devem ser instituídos testes de stress em todas as áreas onde é produzida energia.
Em segundo lugar, importa dizer que também temos de investir parte do dinheiro.
Em segundo lugar, julgo que é vital para nós parar com as distorções do mercado através dos fundos. O facto de um empresário obter fundos para construir um edifício industrial e outro não levará logicamente a uma distorção do mercado. O segundo terá então de incluir o custo da construção do edifício industrial no preço dos produtos que vende, e terá, por conseguinte, preços mais elevados ou lucros mais baixos.
Em segundo lugar, ninguém entende os murmúrios inaudíveis e incompreensíveis dos dirigentes europeus, que não têm mandato e, sobretudo, não têm legitimidade.
Em segundo lugar, no que diz respeito a Dublin II, gostaria de salientar o seguinte, a acrescentar àquilo que a senhora deputada Koppa já disse. A França, tal como a Alemanha, suspendeu as devoluções para a Grécia. O Tribunal Europeu dos Direitos Humanos condenou-nos por motivos específicos, no que se refere tanto a Dublin II como à sua operacionalidade. O que será necessário acontecer ainda para que compreendamos que Dublin II precisa de ser imediatamente reformulado, conforme solicitado pelo Parlamento?
Em segundo lugar, no que diz respeito ao Japão, como muitos de vós têm vindo a dizer, trata-se, em boa verdade, de uma situação do "ovo e da galinha". Iniciamos as negociações e esperamos que no seu decurso possamos resolver a questão dos obstáculos não pautais que estão em vigor desde há muitos anos ou tentamos eliminar a maioria dos obstáculos não pautais como pré-condição para as negociações sobre o acordo de comércio livre? Julgo que, até certo ponto, necessitamos desta condicionalidade porque o verdadeiro problema com o Japão não é tanto os direitos. A ideia seria obviamente eliminar 100% dos direitos, o que normalmente não seria necessário com uma economia em desenvolvimento ou emergente. O verdadeiro problema prende-se com os obstáculos não pautais.
Em segundo lugar, no que se refere às promessas feitas aos agricultores da Europa, uma convergência gradual é realista.
Em segundo lugar, não consigo compreender como podemos conceder essas facilidades a um país que claramente não cumpre as condições do SPG + no que respeita às normas sociais e ambientais e enviar um sinal a outros países, como o Bangladesh, que cumprem de facto essas condições e que, essencialmente, lhes diz que os seus esforços não são desejados e que também é possível alcançar esse estatuto por outros meios.
Em segundo lugar, não existe uma avaliação de impacto, e não conhecemos as consequências que estas medidas terão tanto para a economia do Paquistão como para a economia europeia (em especial, nos sectores têxtil e do etanol, que são especificamente visados pela proposta). Tão pouco sabemos de que forma o Paquistão redistribuirá as receitas das exportações abrangidas por estas medidas para que estas venham a beneficiar efectivamente as regiões afectadas pelas inundações. Por último, deve notar-se que as medidas propostas não estão condicionadas a quaisquer obrigações do Paquistão em matéria de direitos humanos.
Em segundo lugar, não foi surpreendente que no ano passado a Inglaterra tenha recebido tão pouco apoio enquanto país candidato à organização do Campeonato do Mundo, apesar de possuir grandes infra-estruturas. O Qatar foi o vencedor, e assistimos seguidamente à suspensão de pessoas por tentativa de venda dos seus votos.
Em segundo lugar, nós tomámos em consideração todas as alterações supervenientes da Comissão, porque a Comissão - que é o órgão e instituição que tem a reserva da iniciativa legislativa - apresentou a sua proposta, mas depois os termos do pedido do waiver apresentado à Organização Mundial do Comércio não coincidem com a proposta que a Comissão apresentou no Parlamento. E depois sobreveio também o compromisso do Conselho, que também difere da proposta inicial da Comissão.
Em segundo lugar, nós, na Comissão da Indústria, da Investigação e da Energia queremos ter certeza de que o drástico aumento nos custos relativos aos grandes projectos, como o reactor de fusão nuclear ITER e o sistema global de navegação, GALILEO PAS, não afecta mais o orçamento para a investigação. Fizemos propostas nesse sentido e gostaríamos que recebessem uma resposta positiva.
Em segundo lugar, o Livro Verde da Comissão intitulado "Dos Desafios às Oportunidades: para um Quadro Estratégico Comum de Financiamento da Investigação e Inovação da UE" propõe melhorias importantes do programa de investigação e inovação que fará parte do próximo quadro financeiro plurianual da UE.
Em segundo lugar, o compromisso institucional perante as indústrias culturais e criativas, que permitirá aos jovens com talento canalizar de forma construtiva as suas capacidades e ambições, oferecendo-lhes plataformas de lançamento - algumas de carácter profissional - que conduzirão a novas oportunidades de trabalho e evitando que desperdicem os seus talentos em áreas culturalmente estagnadas ou simplesmente inadequadas.
Em segundo lugar, o direito à informação de direitos - a Carta de Direitos - que será acordada muito em breve.
Em segundo lugar, o espaço Schengen é uma das maiores realizações da UE, cujos princípios têm de ser respeitados e defendidos.
Em segundo lugar, o plano de acção para a Grécia está a ser executado e, no espaço de um ano, deu lugar a uma revisão muito profunda do sistema estatístico deste país. Graças a esse processo, a qualidade das estatísticas no âmbito do procedimento por défice excessivo já foi grandemente melhorada, tendo o Eurostat podido validar os dados da Grécia na última ronda.
Em segundo lugar, o princípio do equilíbrio entre a liberalização e a abertura do mercado a novos operadores, e da justiça de forma que os compromissos assumidos com os operadores que realizaram investimentos substanciais possam também ser promovidos, apoiados e mantidos no mercado.
Em segundo lugar, o que é que está a impedir Israel de pagar os impostos devidos aos palestinianos, e por quê? Claro que precisamos de garantir a segurança em Israel, mas os palestinianos não devem ter de sofrer para a garantir a segurança em Israel.
Em segundo lugar, o registo comum assegura a maior participação possível de todas as categorias de operadores, respeitando embora as suas identidades diferentes ou específicas. A nova designação de "Registo da Transparência" torna mais fácil o registo às organizações não comerciais.
Em segundo lugar, o relatório reconhece que, se os dois países fossem incluídos no espaço Schengen, a sua posição geográfica, junto à fronteira turca, criaria duas novas rotas para migrantes ilegais que actualmente se dirigem apenas para a Grécia, que é, neste momento, o único Estado de Schengen da península dos Balcãs.
Em segundo lugar, os centros a nível local devem desenvolver programas de acção que tenham em consideração as diferentes situações de vida e as diferentes necessidades em matéria de serviços de cuidados e de educação na primeira infância Além disso, é fundamental que esses centros possuam autonomia suficiente para poderem desenvolver e implementar programas para as crianças com originalidade e criatividade. Há também necessidade de melhorar a qualidade dos serviços CEPI. A este respeito, penso que deveríamos começar por desenvolver mecanismos de avaliação do fornecimento dos serviços para assegurar o cumprimento das normas de qualidade.
Em segundo lugar, os senhores deputados partilham seguramente a ideia de que a complexidade das regras desincentiva os potenciais beneficiários de requererem a ajuda financeira de UE. Além disso, essa complexidade constitui uma importante fonte de erros, como sublinha o Tribunal de Contas em alguns dos seus relatórios de auditoria.
Em segundo lugar, parte da dívida da Grécia tem de ser perdoada e, para garantir que o remanescente da dívida será pago, deve ser elaborado um plano de recuperação para a economia grega.
Em segundo lugar, penso que a União Europeia se deve comprometer com este projecto de modo mais incondicional. A coordenação e a repartição das tarefas devem ser os princípios orientadores da programação no quadro do novo instrumento de desenvolvimento.
Em segundo lugar, penso que é positivo envolver novas regiões e cidadãos na política de coesão. Todavia, seria pertinente debater estas questões com uma ideia mais clara sobre os custos desta nova política, sobre os efeitos que esta teria sobre a política de coesão em geral e como serão distribuídos os recursos no contexto da reforma das perspectivas financeiras daqui até 2020.
Em segundo lugar, pode dizer-nos o que tenciona fazer no Conselho "Agricultura" e como pode compensar os agricultores que sofreram prejuízos?
Em segundo lugar, porque os barcos de pesca maiores e mais dependentes de combustível receberiam mais fundos do que os mais pequenos e de menor consumo de combustível. Não creio que alguém aqui gostasse de incentivar os navios de maior porte a utilizar mais combustível.
Em segundo lugar, porque realça a necessidade de concluir acordos em matéria de segurança aérea com países terceiros que possuem uma indústria de construção aeronáutica importante; isto é um requisito fundamental, tendo em conta a necessidade legítima de garantir uma segurança aérea cada vez maior.
Em segundo lugar, quanto à questão da participação do público, afirmou, Senhor Comissário Günther Oettinger, que não precisamos de regulamentos circunstanciados nesta área.
Em segundo lugar, queremos saber o que se irá fazer para cobrir e conter o potencial de risco relevante em todos os Estados-Membros. É necessário ter um diagnóstico adequado. O método também tem de ser desenvolvido em conformidade com os diferentes modelos de negócio e estruturas da banca, pelo que é necessário que os testes de esforço proporcionem a informação necessária para se actuar em conformidade.
Em segundo lugar, quero aflorar a questão do bloqueamento automático de fundos europeus sempre que se constata uma má gestão de dinheiro da UE ou quando existem indícios de que esse dinheiro teria sido mal gerido. É extremamente importante que intervenhamos rapidamente sempre que os mecanismos de gestão e execução dos fundos da UE não estejam a funcionar muito bem.
Em segundo lugar, quão realistas são as expectativas da Comissão quanto à data, finais de Outubro, de conclusão destas negociações? Pode a Comissão garantir também que o acordo final incluirá um capítulo sobre desenvolvimento sustentável, de acordo com as exigências do Parlamento? Será que este capítulo prevê normas de trabalho, obrigações associadas aos acordos multilaterais em matéria de ambiente, assim como um mecanismo eficaz para a sua aplicação?
Em segundo lugar, se analisarmos a questão da reversibilidade do combustível e dos resíduos armazenados, o princípio é o de que toda e qualquer instalação de armazenagem deve ser adequada e segura para armazenagem definitiva permanente, do ponto de vista geológico e técnico e em termos da sua construção. Contudo, temos consciência de que haverá desenvolvimentos nos campos da investigação e da ciência.
Em segundo lugar, se partirmos do princípio de que o resultado dos testes de stress não será um placebo e que o selo de aprovação não será atribuído aleatoriamente, e admitirmos, em vez disso, que os testes serão construtivos, críticos e objectivos, então acredito que os mesmos trarão inúmeras vantagens e que a alternativa - a não realização de quaisquer testes de stress - seria uma solução bem pior.
Em segundo lugar, se voltarmos ao dracma sem abolir a zona euro e o euro, não há qualquer instrumento legal para a conversão automática de depósitos em euros nos bancos gregos, tanto dentro como fora da Grécia, para dracmas sem o consentimento dos depositantes.
Em segundo lugar, será introduzido um novo sistema de governação. A Comissão convidou os Estados-Membros a nomearem um representante das PME - "senhora ou senhor PME" - para monitorizar a implementação do SBA a nível nacional.
Em segundo lugar, sublinho a necessidade de uma maior ênfase em áreas temáticas cruciais para o futuro da Europa, tais como a segurança na área da energia, o ambiente e a saúde.
Em segundo lugar, temos a questão do papel da Europa 2020 na garantia de que o trabalho doméstico precário se transformará em emprego sustentável digno. É necessário ter presente o potencial deste sector ao nível da criação de emprego e da conciliação da vida profissional com as responsabilidades familiares, e consequentemente o seu papel na consecução dos objectivos da estratégia de emprego.
Em segundo lugar, temos conseguido, em larga medida, confinar os problemas dos mercados de dívida soberana aos três países no programa.
Em segundo lugar, temos de perguntar que poder, que competência temos para abordar sequer a questão de uma Constituição nacional no Parlamento Europeu? Os Estados-Membros têm a competência soberana de estabelecer as suas Constituições nacionais e, neste caso, deveríamos respeitar o direito de os cidadãos húngaros determinarem a sua Constituição, adoptada pelo seu Parlamento nacional eleito democraticamente.
Em segundo lugar, temos dificuldade em imaginar o Parlamento a aprovar um acordo comercial com o Canadá numa altura em que o Canadá está envolvido numa querela, através da OMC, em torno da proibição do comércio de determinados produtos por parte da UE. Nesta questão, não posso aceitar o ponto de vista do Senhor Comissário, a saber, que devemos manter os dois assuntos separados.
Em segundo lugar, tencionamos criar um instrumento que contribuirá para um tipo de agricultura baseado no conhecimento, isto é, um tipo de agricultura que nos permitirá utilizar os resultados da investigação, do desenvolvimento e da inovação - incluindo a investigação levada a cabo no âmbito da estratégia comum de investigação - e pôr em prática todos estes resultados.
Em segundo lugar, tendo em conta a solicitação formulada no relatório para que a Comissão tome as providências necessárias para eliminar os obstáculos à mobilidade, saliento que, nos próximos dias, deverá ser aprovada uma recomendação do Conselho que visa incentivar os Estados-Membros a tomar precisamente essas medidas.
Em segundo lugar, uma acção preparatória que permita à Comissão financiar projectos-piloto que têm como objectivo seleccionar, dar formação e colocar no terreno um número limitado de voluntários tendo em vista a aprovação de uma proposta legislativa.
Em segundo lugar, é essencial que se adapte os direitos de autor à era digital.
Em segundo lugar, é necessária uma verificação explícita de direitos humanos no Estado de execução. Estes aspectos têm de ser explícitos, e não implícitos.
Em segundo lugar: a União Europeia irá insistir junto da Rússia quanto à necessidade de se realizarem mais progressos relativamente à aprovação de disposições substanciais no domínio do comércio e investimento, nomeadamente quanto à energia, no novo Acordo UE-Rússia, a fim de conferir uma base jurídica sólida para o aprofundamento da cooperação económica nos próximos anos. Não descartamos a possibilidade de trazer até à Cimeira a questão da proibição injustificada por parte da Rússia das importações de legumes da União Europeia, apesar de esperarmos que os dados científicos permitam encontrar rapidamente uma solução a nível dos especialistas.
Em segundo lugar: tomei nota das preocupações do Parlamento relativamente à situação dos direitos humanos na Rússia; partilhamos da maioria delas e essas questões serão colocadas ao Presidente russo na cimeira. O principal fórum para abordar as questões dos direitos humanos e do Estado de direito é o das consultas entre a União Europeia e a Rússia sobre os direitos humanos.
Em sexto lugar, é necessário coordenar a promoção das políticas da UE a nível internacional e apoiar os Estados-Membros nas suas negociações com os países de fora da União Europeia.
Em simultâneo, precisamos incentivar os programas de inovação ambiental, de modo a colmatar as lacunas existentes nas tentativas de combater as alterações climáticas e promover soluções ecológicas.
Em suma, a livre circulação é para a Europa o que os alicerces são para os edifícios. A sua remoção comprometeria toda a estrutura.
Em suma, o que escapa a Vossas Excelências é que as empresas mais não fazem do que jogar segundo as regras do jogo por vós estabelecidas.
Em suma, é minha firme convicção de que é chegado o momento de o Parlamento demonstrar o seu apoio a um futuro ACL entre a UE e o Japão, alicerçado na criação de um grupo de alto nível, especialmente na sequência da catástrofe de Março de 2011.
Em tempo de crise, é importante que haja uma mulher excepcionalmente bem qualificada nesta função de topo, já que, numa crise, as qualidades femininas podem proporcionar um verdadeiro valor acrescentado, coroado pela qualidade.
Em terceiro e último lugar, o orçamento da UE deve incluir um orçamento comum para acções conjuntas.
Em terceiro lugar apoiamos, especificamente, as opiniões da relatora quanto à importância de um financiamento adequado para os programas nacionais de gestão de resíduos.
Em terceiro lugar, a adequação das regras de participação aos novos desafios deverá permitir, por exemplo, uma maior participação das PME e de jovens investigadores nos projectos de investigação.
Em terceiro lugar, a produção de resíduos aumentou ou estabilizou nos últimos anos. A gestão de resíduos está a melhorar em toda a União, e a reciclagem aumentou nos últimos cinco anos.
Em terceiro lugar, as PME deverão ser as principais beneficiárias do programa europeu para a redução de encargos administrativos. A Comissão apresentou propostas ao Conselho e ao Parlamento Europeu para reduzir muito substancialmente os custos administrativos - em mais de 30%, se as mesmas forem implementadas -, enquanto as propostas já adoptadas reduzirão os custos administrativos em 22%.
Em terceiro lugar, as PME têm de ser capazes de participar plenamente no mercado interno, tanto no que diz respeito a concursos públicos transfronteiriços, como no que concerne a todos os outros aspectos do mercado interno, que são capazes de beneficiar de forma extraordinária a competitividade das PME, mas que actualmente não estão a fazê-lo.
Em terceiro lugar, congratulo-me com a adopção da Estratégia da UE para a região do Danúbio pelo Conselho Europeu.
Em terceiro lugar, consideramos que é importante que, quando forem tomadas outras medidas nesta região, sejam elas novos parques de estacionamento para automóveis ou outras iniciativas, se proceda a uma análise especial da totalidade do projecto que inclua áreas desenvolvidas já existentes e projectos de construção existentes.
Em terceiro lugar, embora a actual directiva estipule que os veículos pesados de mercadorias de 3,5 toneladas devam ser abrangidos a partir de 2012, prevê-se a possibilidade, no acordo, de os isentar.
Em terceiro lugar, estamos a falar do dinheiro dos contribuintes, dos cidadãos europeus.
Em terceiro lugar, gostaria de deixar um apelo no sentido de nos certificarmos que os países que se preparam para aderir a Schengen, designadamente a Bulgária e a Roménia, não sejam abandonados em virtude do actual debate. O seu trabalho já está feito; e os seus esforços realizados. Não estamos a pedir que diminuam os requisitos de adesão: se cumprirem os requisitos, é justo que a Bulgária e a Roménia também tenham o direito de se tornarem membros do espaço Schengen.
Em terceiro lugar, gostaria de mencionar o tema da parceria. A parceria é muitas vezes um conceito vazio de conteúdo. Gostaria, por isso, que pudéssemos proporcionar um verdadeiro apoio às cidades, pelo que convido a Comissão a obrigar os Estados-Membros a envolverem os representantes políticos das principais cidades e as federações de órgãos de poder local e regional em todas as fases da tomada de decisões no âmbito da política de coesão. Os representantes locais devem ter uma oportunidade de participar na negociação dos acordos de planeamento nacionais para o desenvolvimento estratégico.
Em terceiro lugar, gostaria de referir que a Europa não pode basear-se em valores de direitos humanos e sociais e desenvolver o acervo comunitário pertinente sem uma protecção de salários, de horários de trabalho, da saúde, sem conhecimento das exigências do trabalho doméstico, e sem conceder aos trabalhadores domésticos um determinado conjunto de garantias.
Em terceiro lugar, gostaria de salientar o facto de o Senhor Comissário parecer ter embarcado numa peregrinação "verde" mas, como observa o humorista polaco Jerzy Lec, mesmo numa peregrinação não nos livramos de maus odores e pés transpirados.
Em terceiro lugar, levaremos a cabo uma avaliação exaustiva do impacto que nos informará sobre os potenciais impactos económicos e sociais do corpo de voluntários.
Em terceiro lugar, na qualidade de relator responsável pelo documento de trabalho da Comissão do Controlo Orçamental "Melhoria do desempenho dos transportes nos eixos ferroviários transeuropeus", gostaria de exortar novamente a Comissão a tomar medidas no sentido de adaptar as infra-estruturas ferroviárias às necessidades dos serviços transeuropeus criando, ao mesmo tempo, ligações em falta nas zonas transfronteiriças, ajudando os Estados-Membros a aliviar as várias complicações relacionadas com a existência de bitolas diferentes e a prestar uma assistência financeira eficaz.
Em terceiro lugar, neste relatório, propomos a publicação precoce pela Comissão de roteiros completos da legislação proposta, para que o Parlamento e todas as partes interessadas tenham a oportunidade de manifestar as suas opiniões durante o prazo de consulta.
Em terceiro lugar, no domínio dos serviços, instamos, em primeiro lugar, a que os serviços públicos sejam deixados de fora dos sectores a liberalizar e, por outro, a respeito do modo IV, a que o princípio da igualdade de tratamento seja garantido - por outras palavras, a que sejam respeitadas todas as formas de dumping social.
Em terceiro lugar, não irá este aspecto gerar novamente um sentimento de que a sobrevivência dos bancos a longo prazo está garantida porque o nosso problema principal, a crise da dívida do estado, não está a ser adequadamente avaliada?
Em terceiro lugar, o Conselho Europeu deverá aprovar a alteração ao Tratado necessária para permitir a criação do Mecanismo Europeu de Estabilização em 2013, com a sua capacidade para ajudar - com base em condições rigorosas - EstadosMembros da área do euro em dificuldades financeiras.
Em terceiro lugar, o actual debate sobre a reforma das resoluções de litígios alternativas poderia incluir igualmente disposições para lidar com estas fraudes.
Em terceiro lugar, o novo mecanismo presta informações adicionais, tais como o número de indivíduos envolvidos em todas as actividades pertinentes para o registo e o nível de recursos da UE recebidos pelos registados.
Em terceiro lugar, o que mais me preocupou foi ver o senhor Comissário Lewandowski sorrir, de uma forma que considero preocupante, quando o tema do imposto sobre as transacções financeiras foi mencionado.
Em terceiro lugar, os prejudicados têm direito a receber rapidamente uma indemnização financeira.
Em terceiro lugar, permitam-me um comentário sobre a gestão financeira. O Tribunal de Contas Europeu submeteu a uma investigação extremamente exaustiva a gestão financeira dos 8.º, 9.º e 10.º Fundos Europeus de Desenvolvimento, não só no seu relatório anual mas também em numerosos relatórios especiais, e teceu comentários muito positivos e verdadeiramente valiosos.
Em terceiro lugar, precisamos de uma maior eficiência na utilização dos dinheiros dos Fundos Estruturais. Têm de existir objectivos mais claros e avaliações mais frequentes, e os próprios beneficiários têm de assumir uma maior responsabilidade. O princípio do co-financiamento tem de ser firmemente estabelecido.
Em terceiro lugar, que consequências teria a introdução de um imposto sobre as transacções financeiras na Europa? Para todas estas questões, o Parlamento exige nos seus relatórios a realização de uma avaliação de impacto.
Em terceiro lugar, temos a questão da alteração da actual legislação-quadro sobre saúde e segurança no local de trabalho - Directiva 89/391/CEE - e sobre o combate à discriminação - Directiva 2000/78/CE.
Em terceiro lugar, temos de assegurar - e neste ponto discordo de alguns dos meus colegas deste Parlamento - que os financiamentos não sejam distribuídos segundo o princípio de que "todos devem ter direito a uma parte". Não é esse o princípio que devemos utilizar para os fundos destinados à investigação. Estes só podem ser afectados segundo o princípio da excelência. A consequência - lamentavelmente - é que os fundos não sejam distribuídos equitativamente a todos os Estados Membros.
Em terceiro lugar, temos de reconhecer as situações em que não é razoável executar um Mandado de Detenção Europeu, para que um cidadão não seja seguido de alertas no Sistema de Informação Schengen por toda a Europa, apesar de a sua extradição ter sido recusada uma vez por motivos válidos.
Em terceiro lugar, temos de reconhecer que muitas pessoas - incluindo alguns dos meus próprios constituintes - ainda estão a ajudar a minorar as consequências da catástrofe, convidando crianças para as suas casas, bem como adoptando muitas outras iniciativas.
Em terceiro lugar, todos os custos relacionados com a segurança devem ser incluídos nos custos da produção da energia, e se tivermos de reservar dinheiro para cobrir todos os custos, isto é, se tivermos de tornar compulsório reservar esse dinheiro, então temos de introduzir legislação a impor níveis de capital obrigatórios.
Em terceiro lugar, uma questão absolutamente essencial que está no cerne do problema: temos de admitir que não sabemos tudo, que existem lacunas nos nossos conhecimentos científicos e que, de facto, por vezes a nossa ignorância é total. Não podemos saber tudo. Não podemos contestar os que tomaram as decisões e, em simultâneo, considerar que é preciso aguardar.
Em terceiro lugar, é necessário realizar um debate público sobre uma nova estratégia europeia de segurança. O documento apresentado por Javier Solana em 2003 foi um contributo importante na altura.
Em terceiro lugar: iremos manter ao mais alto nível o nosso apoio à Parceria para a Modernização, uma vez que se trata de um importante veículo para os compromissos assumidos pela Rússia no que toca à introdução de reformas.
Em terceiro lugar: saudámos, além disso, o facto de a Estratégia "Europa 2020” ser o ponto de referência do próximo Quadro Financeiro Plurianual, sabendo que isso também exige que o calendário seja tido em consideração.
Em termos concretos, a capacidade das ICC para impulsionar a coesão social e territorial dependerá do investimento estratégico.
Em termos concretos, um cliente francês que compre algo de um sítio Internet alemão irá beneficiar da mesma protecção que um cliente alemão. Ao representar um círculo eleitoral de características muito transfronteiriças e sendo oriunda da única região de França que faz fronteira com três outros Estados-Membros da UE, sou particularmente sensível a estes problemas, e esta directiva é um grande passo em frente.
Em termos de esforços no combate ao tráfico ilegal são utilizados os mais recentes métodos de investigação e recolha de informação. Foi desenvolvida uma aplicação única na Europa que permite o processamento dos dados quer no SIS I quer no SIS II. O sistema de vigilância da fronteira marítima foi apresentado como um modelo de boas práticas.
Em termos económicos, as PME são aquilo a que se chama "a espinha dorsal da UE". Na verdade, 99% das empresas europeias são PME, criando mais de 100 milhões de postos de trabalho. A União Europeia encoraja o desenvolvimento destas empresas.
Em termos específicos, é nisto que temos de trabalhar para reforçar as oportunidades dos jovens e, logo, investir nos nossos jovens. A concluir, quero agradecer ao relator a sua cooperação e quero desejar felicidades à senhora Comissária na complicadíssima tarefa - bem o sei - de sensibilizar os outros Comissários no Colégio de Comissários para a importância da cultura e dos jovens.
Em termos gerais, encontrámos um compromisso que muitos deputados poderão apoiar amanhã, de modo a enviarmos um sinal claro no que diz respeito à nova abordagem desta política agrícola. A grande maioria dos membros do Grupo do Partido Popular Europeu (Democratas-Cristãos) apoiará este relatório.
Em termos gerais, gostaria de fazer duas breves observações de cariz político, nomeadamente a falta de uma programação plurianual - sintoma de um défice de liderança - e a falta de incisividade da acção de algumas agências, como é o caso da Agência Ferroviária Europeia. A este propósito, gostaria de registar o atraso - cerca de dois anos após a ocorrência - na definição de procedimentos para apurar responsabilidades no caso do desastre de Viareggio.
Em termos gerais, temos de continuar a prestar especial atenção às pessoas enquanto seres humanos, o que pode ser conseguido com a protecção dos direitos dos trabalhadores e do direito ao trabalho. A OIT desempenha um papel fundamental na cena internacional, que inclui a elaboração, a promoção e transposição destas normas para a realidade.
Em termos globais, saúdo os sistemas EGNOS e GNSS pois podem dar um contributo importante para os objectivos ambientais e de segurança e considero essencial um investimento adequado para a investigação e o desenvolvimento a eles associados.
Em termos jurídicos, era tudo falso. A incapacidade de assegurar a rotulagem é uma desculpa, tecnicamente incorrecta. É perfeitamente possível rotular e rastrear. Não nos dispusémos a fazê-lo, simplesmente porque, como senhor deputado Leinen fez notar agora mesmo, pusemos outros interesses acima dos interesses dos consumidores.
Em termos políticos, a UE deveria insistir com mais veemência para que os partidos políticos em Madagáscar ultrapassem os seus conflitos óbvios e cheguem a acordo sobre o roteiro proposto pela Comunidade de Desenvolvimento da África Astral para se ultrapassar a crise.
Em toda a Europa, os governos estão a impor orçamentos de austeridade, e esta Câmara será excessivamente imprudente se não acatar essa mensagem, se optar por ignorar a carta dos cincos Chefes de Governo, porque o que esses cinco líderes afirmaram foi: a resposta não é mais Europa, mas uma Europa mais inteligente.
Em toda a sua diversidade cultural, a UE é uma comunidade de valores coerente mas variada.
Em todas as fases das negociações, é também necessário garantir que a futura política comercial seja conduzida em consonância com os objectivos da União Europeia, incluindo compromissos vinculativos sobre normas sociais e ambientais.
Em todas as partes da legislação, conquistaram um melhor fluxo de informação para o Parlamento e mais transparência. Têm o compromisso da Comissão de que será realizado um estudo sobre os eurotítulos no prazo de seis meses após a entrada em vigor desta legislação. Este estudo será acompanhado por uma declaração da Comissão, cujo texto consultaram, que define o âmbito de aplicação desse relatório.
Em todas elas existe um apelo à justiça e à equidade, quer a nível da distribuição da riqueza na sociedade, quer da participação democrática na tomada de decisão política, inclusive nas relações internacionais. A UE deve responder a essa exigência.
Em todo este processo, nunca é demais salientar o papel crucial que deve ser atribuído às sociedades civis dos países em desenvolvimento.
Em todo o caso, a minha antecessora Danuta Hübner também elaborou, em colaboração com o Parlamento, um plano de acção sobre esta matéria, que já produziu resultados e cuja eficácia é evidente.
Em todo o caso, apoio os testes de stress, tal como todos os outros colegas e o próprio Reino Unido, e entendo que todos os Estados-Membros devem reafirmar o seu compromisso para com estes testes, que devem ser realizados quanto antes, abrangendo todas as eventualidades e estendendo-se tanto às centrais nucleares como a outras instalações ligadas ao ciclo do combustível nuclear.
Em todo o caso, estes requisitos devem ser vinculativos para ambos os lados, devem ser cumpridos e, se o não forem, terá de haver consequências para ambos os lados em razão do dumping social.
Em todo o caso, mesmo que esse nosso esforço venha a revelar-se inútil, ele será, pelo menos, uma excelente oportunidade para debater o sentido, se algum tem, e os limites da utilização de vantagens comerciais excepcionais como meio de ajuda de emergência ou como meio de gratificação política de um determinado país como neste caso.
Em todo o caso, o Canadá está a lutar por garantir o comércio livre e um sistema liberalizado de investimentos previstos neste acordo para petróleo extraído de areias betuminosas. O estudo de impacto ambiental para este acordo, que foi pago, não inclui a avaliação do impacto que a liberalização terá nas areias betuminosas.
Em todo o mundo e, em particular, nos países pobres, os serviços domésticos estão entre os trabalhos mais mal remunerados.
Em todos esses debates, ouvi o PPE afirmar que não se deveria tratar de política partidária e que não deveríamos destacar Estados-Membros. Não se trata de Estados-Membros, trata-se de direitos fundamentais.
Em todos estes casos, está em causa o nosso envolvimento directo, a pressão que exercemos e a nossa abordagem directa. Não tenham ilusões: somos muito claros, sou muito clara, com todos os líderes com quem me reúno sobre o que penso que tem de acontecer, e faço-o com o apoio deste Parlamento e com o apoio do Conselho dos Ministros dos Negócios Estrangeiros dos 27 Estados-Membros.
Em todos estes domínios, a Europa e os Estados-Membros têm de se empenhar para que os programas Erasmus, que são um dos grandes sucessos da UE, sejam um êxito para todos.
Em troca de um empréstimo de 78 mil milhões de euros, prepara-se a entrega de empresas e de recursos nacionais, o corte nos salários e nas pensões, num país em que o salário mínimo não chega aos 500 euros, o encerramento de serviços públicos, o aumento dos preços de bens e serviços essenciais e o pagamento, só em juros, de 30 mil milhões de euros, cerca de 40 % do montante do empréstimo.
Em vez de aumentar a concorrência e de estabelecer regras comuns para o mercado interno, a nova directiva distorce a concorrência em benefício de alguns Estados-Membros que se encontram no centro do tráfego de mercadorias na Europa. A pretexto de reduzir as emissões de CO2, introduz-se uma taxa com o objectivo de desencorajar o transporte rodoviário a favor do transporte ferroviário e intermodal. A directiva, tal como está concebida, é muito prejudicial para todo o sistema de transporte rodoviário, num período de estagnação económica em que seria necessário aplicar medidas tendentes à revitalização do sector.
Em vez de dias de inactividade, esses novos empregos poderiam ser usados para o desempenho de novos cargos da Europa, para que possamos recorrer à Comissão Europeia, em vez de termos constantemente que criar novas autoridades e agências.
Em vez de nos concentrarmos em todos os outros assuntos sobre os quais nos debruçámos esta semana, façamos de forma a garantir que a UE funcione melhor.
Em vez de nos debatermos por mais legislação em matéria de imigração e migração, devemos antes fazer com que a legislação já existente funcione mais e melhor a favor de todos os cidadãos da União. Ainda assim, as preocupações manifestadas pelos Estados-Membros não são reaccionárias, mas sim a consequência inevitável de mais de vinte anos de circunstâncias em permanente evolução na Europa e em todo o mundo.
Em vez de olharmos para o curto prazo, necessitamos de intervir em apoio de uma melhor protecção das nossas fronteiras externas, da assinatura e observância de acordos de readmissão com os nossos vizinhos do Sul e do Oriente, e da solidariedade com os Estados-Membros sujeitos a um pressão mais forte da imigração na Europa do Sul.
Em vez de prolongar a implementação por dois anos, ela poderia ser concluída, quando possível, no espaço de um ano.
Em vez de serem aplicadas, as regras foram simplesmente liberalizadas e agora temos de pôr termo a essa situação. Está em causa uma legislação credível, não negociações nos bastidores entre os EstadosMembros destinadas a evitar sanções. Se os EstadosMembros não tomarem medidas eficazes para cumprir os seus compromissos e reduzir os seus défices - e estes são compromissos que, recordo, os países assumiram por sua própria vontade - o processo decisório tem de ser eficaz.
Em vez de tentarem unir os povos do Sri Lanka, algumas pessoas procuram manter uma campanha de ódio e de cisão. Consideram este relatório Darusman uma arma nesta campanha e pretendem apenas responsabilizar o Governo do Sri Lanka.
Em vez de um caminho de declínio, cumpre-nos abrir o caminho para o crescimento da Europa, um caminho para a revolução industrial e tecnológica, que é a principal área de inovação. O orçamento para 2012 deve contribuir para a realização da estratégia Europa 2020.
Em vez de um processo relativamente aberto, transparente e baseado em critérios, o que temos nós? Temos uma série de convénios que reúnem Chefes de Estado ou de Governo que dizem uns aos outros: "Eu proporia decididamente esta ou aquela pessoa". Isso não contribui para reforçar a credibilidade da União Europeia. A verdade é que, depois do episódio de Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a Europa não pode dar-se ao luxo de se meter em atalhos quando decide quem vai ser o seu candidato.
Em vez de uma guerra cambial, o FMI deveria lançar um novo grande projecto: o de uma moeda comum mundial para a cooperação, em vez da guerra económica e da concorrência.
Em vez disso, devem centrar-se na criação de plataformas que envolvam empregadores e trabalhadores, universidades, empresas e organizações locais e regionais, a fim de proporcionar oportunidades no sector da educação e da formação profissional e de assegurar que existe uma boa mobilidade e que as qualificações sejam reconhecidas.
Em vez disso, devemos aproveitar de forma consistente todas as oportunidades para fazer economias.
Em vez disso, estamos a criticar a posição da Rússia no caso das importações de produtos hortícolas da UE. Que imagem dá de nós este comportamento a quem está fora da União? Ao procurar a fonte da bactéria mortal e, face à ausência de provas concretas, acusamo-nos mutuamente, restringimos as importações e exportações de produtos de base e exigimos indemnizações. Podemos, com toda a certeza, retirar ilações quanto ao nível de confiança que estamos a inspirar, e não apenas na Rússia.
Em vez disso, fizemos pressão e agora atingimos uma situação bastante complicada, que só pode ser resolvida se deixarmos para trás, de uma vez por todas, ciúmes desgastantes e receitas económicas falhadas.
Em vez disso, queremos recordar a todos como é importante que estas audições não possam ser de modo nenhum selectivas e os procedimentos legais sejam abertos e não-discriminatórios.
Em vez disso, temos de lidar com os factos, incluindo as fontes a que se referiu a senhora deputada Ana Gomes.
Em vez disso, temos de nos questionar sobre os princípios que vão reger o funcionamento da UE no próximo período de sete anos: deveremos ter uma UE baseada na solidariedade, que cumpra as suas obrigações e promova uma economia inovadora e uma política externa comum em conformidade com o Tratado de Lisboa? Ou deveremos ter, em vez disso, uma UE que, na verdade, incluiu objectivos ambiciosos no Tratado mas que, como todos sabem, estava apenas a fazer de conta? Sou uma defensora determinada da primeira hipótese e apoio a opinião do relator no que respeita à necessidade de aumentar o financiamento do próximo Quadro Financeiro Plurianual em 5% comparativamente aos níveis de 2013.
Em vez disso, tende a defender um tratamento paternalista dos pais e um domínio absoluto do Estado na área da educação e dos cuidados durante a primeira infância.
Em virtude da crise económica profunda que afecta a indústria e as pequenas e médias empresas, o preço do barril de petróleo aumentou e os preços do petróleo permanecem muito incertos devido ao risco de instabilidade política no mundo árabe.
Em virtude das próximas eleições parlamentares e presidenciais, as restrições impostas aos membros da oposição relativamente à participação nas eleições e à aparição nos meios de comunicação devem ser eliminadas. Já manifestámos a nossa disponibilidade para estar presentes em todas as fases do processo eleitoral, porém a Rússia deve manifestar vontade de aceitar observadores durante um período alargado, bem como de realizar eleições justas.
Em virtude, especialmente, da natureza desta situação em que, como acontece no governo federal, existem também dois ministérios competentes por região, verifica-se demasiada fragmentação e uma enorme falta de clareza na abordagem à crise e nas comunicações inerentes.
Em vista disso, tenho a total convicção de que a adopção de um registo comum em matéria de transparência representará um importante avanço no aumento da transparência no processo de tomada de decisões da EU e no fornecimento de uma resposta directa às preocupações dos cidadãos.
Em vista do número de centrais nucleares existentes no território da União Europeia e do actual nível de coordenação no interior da UE, que cenários possíveis considera a Comissão, no que diz respeito aos efeitos de um acidente nuclear grave numa central eléctrica, para as populações residentes nos Estados-Membros individuais? A Comissão Europeia tem quaisquer planos para coordenar as posições nacionais no caso de uma catástrofe nuclear? As catástrofes nucleares surgem sempre de surpresa, e sempre têm consequências a nível internacional e global. É, portanto, melhor ter preparado previamente um conjunto de respostas necessárias, que tornem possível minimizar o risco e evitar ulteriores catástrofes.
Em várias ocasiões, o Parlamento Europeu foi convidado a elaborar um livro branco sobre a política de segurança e de defesa. O que pensa sobre isso? Está preparada para juntar as unidades do seu serviço que estão a trabalhar nestas questões e constituir um departamento que poderíamos designar por quartel-general de operações?
Em vésperas da próxima Cimeira UE-Rússia, que terá lugar de 9 a 10 de Junho em Nizhny Novgorod, enviamos uma mensagem inequívoca aos Estados-Membros: temos de dar prioridade às garantias de respeito pelos direitos humanos sobre acordos comerciais mais ambiciosos, a questão dos vistos e a cooperação. A União Europeia devia deixar mais claro à Rússia que ela devia respeitar as suas obrigações e os seus compromissos internacionais.
Em vésperas do Dia Mundial contra o Trabalho Infantil, que se celebra em 12 de Junho, votei a favor deste relatório importante e oportuno que convida as partes nos acordos de comércio livre a empenharem-se na eliminação de todas as formas de trabalho forçado e na abolição do trabalho infantil, em conformidade com a Declaração da OIT relativa aos princípios e direitos fundamentais no trabalho.
Em zonas de fronteira fora da Líbia, a Comissão está a apoiar o pré-posicionamento de reservas de emergência.
Em última análise, a solução terá de partir da União Europeia, que se deve tornar mais auto-suficiente em termos de abastecimento de energia, incluindo, evidentemente, a energia de fontes renováveis.
Em última análise, e independentemente de toda a transparência conseguida, tudo se resume aos valores morais de cada deputado desta Assembleia, pois só estes ditarão o que ele pensa que está certo, quem é que ele recebe e quem é que ele decide não receber, a quem é que ouve e a quem é que decide não ouvir.
Em última análise, não se trata apenas de um problema para a Comissão da Agricultura e do Desenvolvimento Rural.
Em última análise, pergunto-me quem beneficiará das decisões que serão tomadas esta semana.
Em última instância, cabe mais aos Estados-Membros do que à ABE extrair as necessárias ilações criando as condições, os instrumentos e as backstops, aos quais iremos estar muito atentos durante o período imediatamente a seguir aos testes de esforço.
Embora a Comissão tenha claramente afirmado que a directiva relativa à publicidade enganosa e comparativa proíbe as práticas enganosas destas empresas de directórios, impõe-se que a Comissão analise igualmente a questão da transposição dessa directiva pelos Estados-Membros, a fim de apurar se os cidadãos recebem igual protecção em toda a União. O facto de a directiva ter sido transposta pelos Estados-Membros não significa necessariamente que estas medidas sejam abrangentes ou estejam em conformidade umas com as outras.
Embora a Directiva não deva permitir a discriminação com base na nacionalidade do transportador, o artigo 7.º-k permite aos Estados-Membros que introduzam um sistema de cobrança de portagens e/ou direitos de utilização de infra-estruturas para proporcionar uma compensação adequada desses custos, o que pode distorcer a concorrência.
Embora a Estratégia de Lisboa e a Estratégia "Europa 2020” tenham conferido à política social um relevo sem precedentes, as questões da competitividade e os factores económicos continuam a ter prioridade em relação às questões sociais.
Embora a Estratégia de Lisboa e a Estratégia UE 2020 confiram à política social um relevo sem precedentes, as questões de competitividade e os factores económicos continuam a ter prioridade em relação às questões sociais. A defesa das nossas normas laborais contidas nas oito convenções da OIT, relativas à liberdade de associação e de negociação colectiva, à eliminação do trabalho forçado e obrigatório, à eliminação da discriminação em matéria de emprego e profissão e à abolição do trabalho infantil, é fundamental. É necessário colocar o enfoque na protecção dos direitos dos trabalhadores e no primado do direito do trabalho.
Embora a Estratégia de Lisboa tenha conferido e a Estratégia "Europa 2020” confira à política social um relevo sem precedentes, as questões da competitividade e os factores económicos continuam a ter prioridade em relação às questões sociais.
Embora a Europa se mantenha atrás dos Estados Unidos e esteja a perder o avanço que tinha sobre as economias em desenvolvimento, os resultados do Sétimo Programa-Quadro demonstram o valor acrescentado que este programa europeu representa para a investigação e o desenvolvimento na Europa.
Embora a Vice-Presidente/Alta Representante tenha feito excelentes nomeações - vi algumas perante a Comissão dos Assuntos Externos - devo perguntar por que razão é que ela ficou desapontada com um acordo da Comissão, que parece ter reservado um montante desproporcionado de recursos para o alargamento da UE e para a Política de Vizinhança. Esta afectação não oferece uma boa relação custo-benefício aos contribuintes europeus, nem serve os nossos interesses da política externa.
Embora a ajuda humanitária urgente sob a forma de financiamento seja essencial na resposta a catástrofes, como a ocorrida no Paquistão, é preciso fazer mais. A forma mais eficaz de promovermos o desenvolvimento é permitir que as pessoas se valham a si próprias.
Embora a comissão tenha votado por maioria a proposta da Comissão, de concessão destas preferências excepcionais ao Paquistão, a verdade é que a Comissão do Comércio Internacional também votou várias alterações no sentido de limitar o impacto destas vantagens comerciais concedidas ao Paquistão, incluindo entre outras, alterações e aprovação de uma cláusula de salvaguarda, caso as importações do Paquistão tenham uma subida demasiado elevada em virtude da redução ou eliminação das tarifas comerciais de importação. Outras alterações referem-se, por exemplo, a exigir que o Paquistão não crie ou extinga as restrições que tem às exportações de matérias-primas.
Embora a crise económica e financeira se tenha sobreposto a muitas destas actividades, a política estrutural europeia continuará a proporcionar um forte estímulo ao crescimento e ao emprego.
Embora a ideia de uma rede de segurança seja atractiva, não é suficiente. É necessário regressar a mecanismos de intervenção pública para garantir preços de base para os pequenos e médios agricultores.
Embora a igualdade entre os sexos seja reconhecida como uma condição necessária para a realização do desenvolvimento sustentável e dos Objectivos de Desenvolvimento do Milénio em matéria de alterações climáticas, segundo os especialistas a política relativa às alterações climáticas não confere a devida atenção a este princípio.
Embora a prevenção seja melhor do que a cura, estaremos igualmente melhor colocados para actuar na correcção deste tipo de situações, caso ocorram.
Embora a relação forjada entre as economias dos diferentes Estados-Membros e entre elas e a União careça de revisão, particularmente à luz do que aconteceu na Grécia e do facto de outros Estados-Membros estarem a mostrar sinais da iminência de uma crise financeira à escala da grega, tal revisão não pode ser levada a cabo com os métodos apresentados neste relatório. O relatório procura corrigir as vulnerabilidades das economias nacionais aumentando - excessivamente, na minha opinião - a autoridade da UE em detrimento dos Estados-Membros, sacrificando a sua liberdade e os seus poderes em relação às finanças. Por conseguinte, não posso votar a favor deste relatório.
Embora a revogação destas normas possa parecer um passo positivo e bem-vindo do ponto de vista da simplificação legislativa, significaria, por outro lado, privar a nossa indústria têxtil de formas de defesa ainda válidas contra a concorrência desleal de países como a China.
Embora a votação final tenha sido adiada, submetemos a votação várias alterações. Estas "medidas comerciais excepcionais" com os parceiros dos Balcãs Ocidentais, ao abrigo do Processo de Estabilização e de Associação da União Europeia, são na realidade medidas pautais preferenciais que garantem um acesso mais fácil das exportações dos países nossos parceiros ao mercado comunitário. Têm de ser notificadas à Organização Mundial do Comércio. O programa findou no final de 2010, e o que temos agora é simplesmente uma extensão dele. O programa foi bloqueado devido ao atraso da decisão de comitologia.
Embora a votação sobre a nomeação de certos oligarcas europeus seja, de acordo com o regulamento, um escrutínio secreto, faço questão de anunciar que votei contra o senhor Draghi, uma vez que há algo realmente pouco saudável e perverso na nomeação de um antigo director europeu do Goldman Sachs em plena crise da dívida soberana. O período durante o qual ele exerceu as suas funções, assim como a natureza das mesmas, não podem escapar à vossa atenção. Não é possível que o senhor Draghi, a menos que não passasse de um director medíocre, e mesmo que não tenha sido o instigador, ignorasse que empresa para a qual trabalhava orquestrou a manipulação, aparentemente legal, mas desonesta, da dívida grega, para justificar a adesão da Grécia ao euro.
Embora alguns fabricantes de produtos se tenham oposto a esta iniciativa, remetendo para a legislação existente relativa aos requisitos de etiquetagem de partes de origem animal, foi agora feita uma melhoria, que constitui uma indicação muito real da perspectiva europeia orientada para o consumidor.
Embora apoiemos esta mobilização, pois torna-se imprescindível apoiar estes trabalhadores, reiteramos as nossas reservas e posição crítica relativamente a este Fundo por considerarmos que seria mais importante terem sido tomadas medidas de prevenção do desemprego visando evitá-lo. Para isso, há que mudar as políticas neoliberais vigentes nesta UE, de que é exemplo a insistência na desregulação e liberalização do comércio internacional.
Embora as agências possam não ter despoletado a crise financeira mundial, as suas acções exacerbaram-na. Na realidade, encorajam a especulação, pondo em perigo o possível êxito dos planos de recuperação, já de si draconianos, que foram impostos aos cidadãos desses países. É por isso que a criação de uma Agência Europeia de Notação de Risco é urgente e deve adoptar o estatuto jurídico de uma fundação independente.
Embora as nações bálticas tenham manifestado repetidamente as suas preocupações, os funcionários e as instituições da União Europeia não tiveram qualquer tipo de reacção a fim de impedir que a França se envolvesse numa transacção militar com a Rússia.
Embora concordando com o princípio do "poluidor-pagador", é questionável, num período de crise, a aplicação de uma taxa de portagem adicional aos transportes internacionais rodoviários, sobretudo sem a obrigação de destinar as receitas correspondentes a investimentos na melhoria das infra-estruturas.
Embora considere que ainda há muito por fazer ao nível das PME e dos direitos dos consumidores, este relatório é um primeiro passo no que diz respeito à facilitação das trocas comerciais transfronteiriças entre PME.
Embora continuemos a ser confrontados com uma turbulência considerável em alguns segmentos dos mercados de dívida soberana de determinados países, lográmos conter a crise da dívida soberana e proteger a recuperação económica em curso na Europa. É claro que é preciso prosseguir o trabalho e ainda temos decisões difíceis pela frente, nomeadamente nas semanas que restam do mês de Junho.
Embora defenda um reforço da cooperação e da ajuda ao desenvolvimento por parte da UE, concordo com as propostas da relatora cujo relatório voto favoravelmente.
Embora esse ponto seja consensual entre os peritos já há bastante tempo, a mensagem só recentemente e a muito custo chegou à esfera política.
Embora esta questão não seja, na minha opinião, muito relevante para o Estado-Membro que represento - pois não tencionamos aderir ao euro e, por conseguinte, as sanções associadas não se aplicam no nosso caso - é uma questão extremamente complexa e controversa para muitos países, incluindo para aqueles que tencionam aderir.
Embora esta seja, e continue a ser, uma das instituições mais transparentes da União, continuo a acreditar que, com o aumento de poder, aumenta a responsabilidade, que é exactamente o que devemos tentar conseguir nos próximos meses. O acordo alcançado hoje com a Comissão não é mau, mas os representantes de grupos de interesses têm de ser obrigados a introduzir os seus nomes e os seus verdadeiros interesses num registo. É o que este Parlamento já está a pedir aos representantes de grupos de interesses que nos procuram.
Embora este agente patogénico não deva ser tratado principalmente com antibióticos, existe o problema de ele ser resistente a muitos antibióticos comuns.
Embora este tenha sido oficialmente proibido desde 1986, estima-se que cerca de 60 milhões de crianças continuam a trabalhar nos campos e nas fábricas na Índia. A Comissão não pode ignorar as normas sociais mínimas nestas negociações.
Embora esteja relacionado com factores químicos e físicos que, à primeira vista, não são relevantes para a comunicação entre políticos e votantes, este indicador é, na realidade, o resultado de numerosas decisões económicas: indica a concentração de actividades económicas poluentes, a composição do cabaz energético utilizado para as actividades produtivas e para o aquecimento de casas e escritórios, a utilização de veículos motorizados e a gestão das infra-estruturas rodoviárias e do tráfego, o isolamento dos edifícios e a qualidade dos materiais utilizados, e ainda a existência ou não de zonas verdes, para dar apenas alguns exemplos. A qualidade do ar tem também um impacto significativo sobre as despesas com a saúde, particularmente no domínio das doenças respiratórias e oncológicas. É, pois, muito claro que um indicador ambiental pode transformar-se num indicador económico e político.
Embora estejam contidos no relatório todos os requisitos para uma Europa inclusiva, sustentável e competitiva, nunca poderíamos, de modo algum, financiar tudo em simultâneo a partir do orçamento da UE. Quero uma estratégia de negociação realista e executável, e isto não foi alcançado, uma vez que não foram definidas prioridades claras neste relatório.
Embora estejam contidos no relatório todos os requisitos para uma Europa inclusiva, sustentável e competitiva, é impossível financiar tudo em simultâneo a partir do orçamento da UE. Queremos uma estratégia de negociação realista e executável, mas, uma vez que não foram definidas prioridades claras neste relatório, consideramos que este objectivo não foi alcançado.
Embora estejam separadas por longas distâncias e tenham experiência de sistemas políticos diferentes, a União Europeia e a Mongólia partilham tradições de tolerância, abertura e igualdade.
Embora eu acredite que é do nosso interesse melhorar a cooperação comercial com o Japão, devemos procurar tornar a cooperação correcta, aberta, equilibrada e benéfica para ambas as partes.
Embora eu pense que a prioridade deveria ser dada, em primeiro lugar, aos dados já disponíveis (isto é, aos dados recolhidos a nível regional, nacional e europeu), considero que na eventualidade de surgir a necessidade de módulos complementares, o que não implica burocracia desnecessária ou custos adicionais, nesse caso o Eurostat deveria ser autorizado a compilar os dados dos Estados-Membros tendo em vista à criação de contas económicas do ambiente a nível europeu.
Embora eu represente as regiões do Centre, Auvergne e Limousin, que não têm fronteiras com outros Estados-Membros da União Europeia, estou convencida da utilidade da cooperação transfronteiras - e, de um modo mais geral, da cooperação territorial - para o desenvolvimento da Europa e criação de pontes entre os povos.
Embora fosse possível melhorar ainda mais o texto e continue a haver um ponto que, a meu ver, não foi resolvido, nomeadamente a definição de resíduos radioactivos, penso que devemos seguir em frente nesta área e que é inútil negar a necessidade de tratar os resíduos.
Embora haja algumas referências positivas aos princípios gerais da "humanização do trabalho”, à promoção da criatividade e à necessidade de acessibilidade das vias de transição da aprendizagem informal para a aprendizagem formal, não passam de letra morta sem conteúdo que serve apenas para enfeitar um relatório que, em última análise, promove o neoliberalismo em todos os processos e em todas as fases do ensino e da formação, mesmo ao nível mais elevado.
Embora haja muitos aspectos neste relatório que merecem a nossa admiração, sejamos honestos connosco próprios e com os nossos eleitores. A menos que tenhamos o n.º 1, tudo isto é inútil - e o n.º 1, no qual solicitamos uma PAC forte e sustentável com uma dotação orçamental à altura dos objectivos ambiciosos, será inútil também. À semelhança de outros colegas, quero expressar a minha preocupação, nomeadamente com os rumores de hoje de que o senhor Presidente Barroso tenciona fazer cortes brutais no orçamento e, em especial, no segundo pilar.
Embora haja que respeitar o princípio da reversibilidade, é necessário considerar conceitos e soluções técnicas para a eliminação definitiva, a fim de permitir o acesso e a recuperação potenciais de resíduos por razões técnicas, ou na eventualidade de os progressos da investigação permitirem a emergência de novas soluções tecnológicas, tais como a transmutação. Concordo com o objectivo da proposta de assegurar que sejam reservados recursos financeiros adequados para financiar o desmantelamento de centrais nucleares e que a gestão de resíduos se processe de uma forma transparente.
Embora isso corresponda, no essencial, à verdade, ainda não estamos onde iremos chegar. O desafio que enfrentamos é o de garantir que, não apenas este Parlamento ou o desejo expresso pelos senhores deputados com a paixão que aqui sinto, mas também a Comissão, o Conselho, o Conselho dos Negócios Estrangeiros, o Conselho do Desenvolvimento e os Ministros da Defesa - todos as coisas a que presido e por cuja coordenação sou responsável - possam avançar com essa mesma ambição. Não me surpreende de todo, e julgo que também não surpreenderá os senhores deputados, que ao perseguir esse objectivo - e sobretudo num momento em que há tanto a acontecer - venhamos a descobrir que as coisas não funcionam necessariamente com a eficácia que os senhores desejariam, ou que eu própria, na verdade, por vezes desejaria.
Embora mantenhamos a nossa posição crítica relativamente ao Fundo Europeu de Ajustamento à Globalização, por considerarmos que seria mais importante terem sido tomadas medidas de prevenção do desemprego visando evitá-lo, votámos favoravelmente a mobilização do referido Fundo para prestar assistência adicional aos trabalhadores afectados pelas consequências de reestruturação de empresas ou da liberalização do comércio internacional.
Embora me agrade notar que apelamos a valores que nós, europeus, consideramos fundamentais, admito também que foi com alguma tristeza que apoiei este relatório.
Embora nem todos os compromissos apresentados e aprovados em Comissão da Indústria, da Investigação e da Energia correspondam sempre integralmente ao equilíbrio que, pela minha parte, desejaria, apoio muito sinceramente o movimento geral com vista ao desenvolvimento de uma abordagem mais integrada da gestão do espectro, que seja realista e dê resposta às necessidades sociais, culturais e económicas dos nossos concidadãos. Trata-se de uma orientação, Senhora Comissária, constante nas posições tomadas pelo nosso Parlamento, seja sobre o relatório de iniciativa da minha colega Patrizia Toia, seja sobre as propostas que eu própria tinha defendido enquanto uma das relatoras do pacote telecomunicações.
Embora não concorde plenamente com algumas decisões, o relatório é, no seu conjunto, benéfico para os interesses da Bulgária, e votei a favor da sua aprovação.
Embora não restem dúvidas de que a crise do sistema bancário contribuiu de modo considerável para os actuais problemas económicos, seria um erro ocultar o facto de que a maioria dos problemas surgiu antes da crise, devido à falta de disciplina orçamental em numerosos países, a políticas económicas que não reforçaram a competitividade e à ausência de coordenação da política económica europeia.
Embora não seja totalmente a favor da afectação dos recursos assim libertados ao orçamento da União, uma vez que considero que os Objectivos de Desenvolvimento do Milénio devem, pelo menos em parte, beneficiar desses recursos, quis votar a favor do n.º 171 para enviar um sinal positivo à Comissão e ao Conselho sobre a aplicação deste imposto.
Embora não veja entraves ao comércio livre entre a UE e o Canadá, a legislação passada demonstra que a UE, na sua ambição, tem uma predisposição para usurpar o lugar do Reino Unido e não para ocupar uma posição paralela em relações comerciais existentes entre o Reino Unido e países terceiros.
Embora o Canadá seja um dos nossos parceiros de comércio mais antigos, não podemos negar que, por vezes, divergimos nas nossas opiniões. Por exemplo, o Canadá opôs-se às políticas de OGM da UE e intentou uma acção junto da OMC contra a proibição pela UE do comércio de produtos derivados da foca, para além do bárbaro abate anual das focas, e não se esqueçam que se opõe à Directiva relativa à qualidade da gasolina e do combustível para motores diesel para proteger as suas exportações de areias betuminosas para a UE.
Embora o Canadá tenha uma forte presença no comércio internacional e seja um dos mais antigos parceiros comerciais da União Europeia, temos de proceder sensata e construtivamente para concluirmos um acordo económico e comercial abrangente entre a União Europeia e o Canadá. As nossas posições divergentes em áreas como a política de combate às drogas, a política de pescas e a produção de petróleo a partir de areias betuminosas têm de ficar claras no acordo de forma a representar a política da União Europeia e respeitar, simultaneamente, os pontos de vista do nosso parceiro comercial. A reciprocidade é o cerne de relações comerciais e económicas equilibradas.
Embora o Japão e a União Europeia sejam economias maduras, a sua cooperação comercial não tem explorado as oportunidades oferecidas pelo seu peso e influência económicos. A cooperação comercial mais eficaz é prejudicada não apenas pelos direitos, como também pelas numerosas obstruções que o Japão colocou à normalização e ao acesso aos contratos públicos.
Embora o PIB seja um forte indicador macroeconómico, ele não reflecte os grandes problemas sociais da Lituânia, como o desemprego, a qualidade dos sistemas de educação e de saúde e as disparidades na distribuição dos rendimentos.
Embora o Parlamento tenha finalmente chegado a um acordo sobre o Registo de Transparência, cedendo, sem dúvida, à pressão do recente escândalo a respeito dos grupos de interesses, este registo será impotente.
Embora o acordo anterior não tenha de facto sido concluído, desta vez, todos os envolvidos parecem estar confiantes. O principal negociador do Canadá até admitiu, no início do ano, que este acordo foi uma prioridade de topo para o Canadá. Como segundo maior parceiro comercial, a UE está claramente destinada a contrabalançar a posição do mercado dos EUA e, inversamente, no que respeita à Europa, o Canadá representa uma porta de entrada para a área económica do NAFTA.
Embora o custo do projecto tenha aumentado exponencialmente de 6 para 16 mil milhões de euros desde o seu lançamento em 2006, penso que deve prosseguir agora com os recursos disponíveis. Não se deverá acrescentar ao ITER nem mais um euro.
Embora o objectivo da procura de mais frequências para as comunicações de banda larga sem fios deva ser prosseguido e incentivado, parece pertinente basearmo-nos nesse inventário - sem antecipar o seu resultado - para designar, sem uma avaliação técnica prévia, uma ou várias bandas de frequências específicas.
Embora o país tenha acesso a fontes de financiamento multilaterais, existe o perigo de no período imediatamente a seguir ao referendo se criar uma falha de financiamento que tornará o Sudão do Sul altamente vulnerável e em grande risco de um colapso do Estado.
Embora o processo de quitação em curso se centre no ano de 2009, é importante retirar lições para o futuro e, por fim, simplificar também a gestão financeira.
Embora o relatório do Parlamento Europeu sobre "Investir no futuro: um novo Quadro Financeiro Plurianual (QFP) para uma Europa competitiva, sustentável e inclusiva" contenha muitas ideias que devem ser apoiadas, não lhe dei o meu apoio porque considero que prejudica a imagem da União Europeia aos olhos dos seus habitantes. O relatório propõe aumentar o encargo fiscal que impende sobre os cidadãos europeus, e não posso concordar com isso.
Embora o relatório seja ambicioso na procura do maior apoio maioritário possível da Assembleia, entendo que, na sua forma actual, lhe falta ambição nos objectivos e metas que procura realizar.
Embora os números do desemprego juvenil europeu sejam extremamente preocupantes - em Janeiro de 2011, a taxa de desemprego das pessoas com idade inferior a 25 anos na UE aumentou para 20,6% - o relatório sobre esta iniciativa emblemática para 2020, "Juventude em Movimento”, insta os Estados-Membros a aumentarem o seu investimento na educação, formação e mobilidade.
Embora possamos concordar que, em determinados domínios, como a política monetária, a UE pode representar a posição predominante nas organizações multilaterais pertinentes, é difícil aceitar a ideia de que o Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa possa assumir o papel de representante de uma posição comum dos Estados-Membros na cena mundial, quando, com tanta frequência, os países da Europa têm interesses tão diferentes que é impossível chegarem, eles próprios, a uma posição comum.
Embora possamos discordar quanto à questão de saber se esses critérios foram preenchidos, foram feitos muitos progressos.
Embora reconhecendo o sentido de responsabilidade demonstrado pela Comissão nas dotações previstas para 2012, na minha qualidade de relatora sobre o orçamento destinado à Comissão dos Direitos da Mulher e da Igualdade dos Géneros, lamento os reduzidos aumentos em programas como o PROGRESS, responsável pela implementação de importantes iniciativas que visam os jovens, a luta contra a pobreza e a igualdade dos géneros, e ainda o Programa Daphne, responsável por políticas destinadas a combater a violência contra as mulheres.
Embora reconheça a importância e a necessidade de termos autoridades estatísticas independentes capazes de produzir dados fiáveis e credíveis sobre as previsões macroeconómicas e orçamentais de um Estado-Membro, votei contra este relatório porque a sua lógica, punitiva, se integra perfeitamente num pacote mais vasto a que me oponho pelas razões já expostas nos relatórios desta coordenação económica.
Embora reconheça a necessidade de avançarmos e de não atribuirmos culpas a ninguém, não podemos escapar aos factos e quando se trata de conduzir negociações em que o Parlamento já tinha cedido muito - bem, foi demais.
Embora reconheça a necessidade de um debate público sobre segurança externa e defesa em ordem à definição de uma política futura do PE nesta matéria, saúdo a elaboração deste relatório e formulo votos para que a UE continue a desenvolver um multilateralismo eficaz, que é uma das marcas da sua preocupação geoestratégica.
Embora reconheça a possibilidade de introdução de melhorias, nomeadamente na pormenorização dos acontecimentos por país, na descrição dos meios necessários à consecução dos objectivos da política externa da UE, bem como numa apreciação mais qualitativa desta política com a inclusão de recomendações estratégicas e organizativas para o futuro, saúdo a elaboração deste relatório e faço votos de que a UE continue a desenvolver um multilateralismo eficaz, que é uma das marcas da preocupação geoestratégica da UE.
Embora reconheça que o texto final aprovado hoje em Estrasburgo seja menos negativo do que o texto anterior acordado em comissão parlamentar, a imposição desta taxa continuará a ser uma realidade e trará um acréscimo dos custos existentes para os países periféricos da União Europeia.
Embora reconheça que é importante promover métodos humanos de gestão da mão-de-obra, a política social da UE já causou estragos em várias instituições do Reino Unido e não deve ser expandida. É necessária alguma flexibilidade e liberdade em matéria de política social, porque a política "de tamanho único” pode ser contraproducente quando aplicada a nível interno.
Embora saúde a declaração do Senhor Comissário, confirmo que sou contra qualquer tentativa de aplicar medidas proteccionistas num sector em que, na verdade, no passado, a Europa dificultou o acesso aos medicamentos de baixo custo.
Embora se espere que o Sudão do Sul se candidate à adesão ao Acordo de Cotonu, o 10.º Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento só estará disponível algum tempo depois da adesão ao acordo. Há, portanto, o risco de se verificar um vazio de financiamento no período imediatamente a seguir ao referendo, numa altura em que o Sudão do Sul estará muito vulnerável e em risco considerável de colapso nacional. É claramente necessário impedir isto por causa da ameaça de uma catástrofe humanitária; deveríamos, portanto, fazer tudo o que está ao nosso alcance para ajudar os sudaneses a ultrapassar este período difícil e para impedir a repetição dos conflitos sangrentos.
Embora se reconheça o papel das agências no fornecimento de informação e no fomento da liquidez nos mercados, é agora evidente que os operadores financeiros confiaram demasiado nas apreciações das ANC e que as suas acções contribuíram para gerar a crise financeira.
Embora seja a favor do aumento da coordenação e da eficiência e da concatenação das políticas, a fim de evitar vazios de regulação, entendo que a UE não deve perder a pluralidade de vozes de que dispõe no seio das instituições internacionais. A crise pôs em evidência as enormes diferenças que existem entre as economias da UE, mesmo no interior da própria área do euro, não falando sequer dos países que não pertencem ao euro.
Embora seja a favor dos princípios subjacentes ao relatório, penso que as suas conclusões não são totalmente correctas, pelo que me abstive.
Embora seja de saudar uma maior previsibilidade em relação às oportunidades de IDE para os investidores da UE, os potenciais aspectos negativos da política de investimento, por exemplo, e o receio, entre as populações locais, de redundâncias e cortes salariais devido à subcontratação e à deslocalização da produção não devem ser varridos para baixo do tapete.
Embora seja difícil desenvolver um método que seja simultaneamente coerente, consideramos que é necessário um conceito abrangente que tenha em conta as medidas já existentes e possa ser aplicado na prática. É importante desenvolver um novo instrumento que possa complementar o PIB, que tenha uma aplicação prática, que tenha como base indicadores claramente definidos e que assente em dados de qualidade.
Embora seja importante autorizar os acordos de investimento existentes, também é importante prever a possibilidade de actuar de forma cooperativa no sentido de lidar com as questões importantes que possam surgir em relação ao teor dos acordos e à sua interacção com a política de investimento da UE. Devemos reservar mecanismos apropriados para a acção da União para permitir o desenvolvimento e a implementação da política ao nível da UE. Reconheço que em relação à proposta da Comissão, o âmbito de tal acção é a questão mais difícil - para o Parlamento e ainda mais para o Conselho.
Embora seja inteiramente a favor de uma parceria desse tipo, que tem de ser uma parceria estratégica, estou muito surpreendido com a pressão que a Rússia está actualmente a exercer, especialmente na Ucrânia.
Embora seja vital dar a devida atenção à ligação entre estes serviços e a igualdade de oportunidades entre homens e mulheres, estes objectivos são claramente problemáticos e ultrapassados, uma vez que não têm em conta muitos dos aspectos qualitativos fundamentais de uma forte política de educação na primeira infância.
Embora talvez não estejamos satisfeitos, iremos votar a favor das directivas devido aos prazos extremamente apertados: ultrapassá-los tornaria as directivas inúteis.
Embora tenha assumido compromissos, ao abrigo do Protocolo de Quioto, de reduzir as suas emissões de CO2, renegou esses compromissos devido aos benefícios financeiros que retira das areias betuminosas. Não queremos um conflito com o Canadá, mas temos de insistir que não nos esquivaremos de enfrentar verdades inconvenientes.
Embora tenham sido construídas ou reparadas muitas estradas e tenham sido instaladas ligações à Internet, ainda existem bastantes necessidades a satisfazer, uma vez que há um fosso muito grande entre estas zonas e as regiões mais desenvolvidas.
Embora tenham sido realizados progressos técnicos significativos, o relatório é mais crítico no que respeita à situação financeira do projecto. O relatório levanta questões que é forçoso abordar e recomenda linhas de acção para que o sistema de satélites atinja a capacidade operacional plena com a maior brevidade possível, significando isto um retorno mais rápido do investimento, e fornece a base para o debate sobre a melhor maneira de a Comissão atingir este objectivo.
Embora tenhamos conseguido acordar com as delegações do Parlamento quanto à via a seguir, a implementação da solução encontrada ainda requer algum tempo.
Embora tenhamos de actuar a fim de incentivar o maior número possível de cidadãos a frequentar o ensino superior e de combater activamente o abandono escolar precoce - apenas 31% dos europeus possuem um diploma universitário, em comparação com os 40% dos Estados Unidos e os 50% do Japão - também precisamos de assegurar a empregabilidade dos diplomados.
Embora tenhamos realizado muitos debates sobre esta questão, as medidas tomadas na Europa têm, infelizmente, sido ineficazes, apesar da ameaça que ela representa para o nosso continente e a nossa economia.
Embora tenhamos um mercado interno, as empresas e os consumidores não aproveitam suficientemente as oportunidades que este oferece, na medida em que a proporção de transacções transfronteiriças continua a ser bastante baixa. O mercado interno pode ser revitalizado, para tal incentivando as transacções transfronteiriças, e creio que este relatório vai ajudar a alcançar este objectivo.
Embora tivesse gostado de um resultado mais ambicioso, o relatório Garriga Polledo sobre as perspectivas financeiras a partir de 2014 constitui um passo em frente, que é fruto de um amplo compromisso político no seio da Comissão Especial, criada pela primeira vez no Parlamento, antes de a Comissão apresentar a sua proposta.
Embora, como refere a relatora, esteja prevista a entrada da Croácia na União Europeia no segundo semestre de 2012 ou no início de 2013, pode aceitar-se a sua participação no referido Observatório, dado que esse país está a fazer esforços em termos de investigação e repressão dos crimes relacionados com droga.
Embora, inicialmente, a proposta visasse apenas os Estados-Membros cuja moeda é o euro, o Parlamento Europeu pretende a sua aplicação a todos os Estados que, mesmo não sendo membros da zona euro, tenham notificado a Comissão da sua vontade de aplicar o presente regulamento.
Embora, para já, não estejam ainda disponíveis dados numéricos fiáveis sobre a extensão dos prejuízos no sector da horticultura na sequência da crise do E coli, os danos económicos sofridos pelo sector não serão, decerto, desprezáveis.
Encaixado no meio do n.º 166, aparece um apelo ao fim das correcções. Este é o instrumento que permite ao Reino Unido pagar apenas uma contribuição líquida inaceitável em vez de uma contribuição líquida vergonhosa.
Encaramos com bons olhos o enfoque do relatório nos desafios comuns com que estamos confrontados: os problemas climáticos e ambientais, a luta pela democracia, pela paz e pela liberdade a nível mundial e a necessidade urgente de investigação, de inovação e de infra-estruturas. A estratégia Europa 2020 e o investimento em iniciativas com valor acrescentado europeu foram temas recorrentes nos debates realizados durante o trabalho de preparação do relatório.
Encaramos esse método de votação como um instrumento que deve ser aplicado em casos excepcionais e cuja utilização tem sempre de ser explicada de forma adequada e exaustiva, com a realização das verificações pertinentes para assegurar que a sua utilização seja coerente com o direito primário.
Encaro com bons olhos o enfoque do relatório nos desafios comuns com que a Europa está confrontada. O relatório aborda os problemas climáticos e ambientais como elementos integrantes de todos os domínios políticos, a luta pela democracia, pela paz e pela liberdade a nível mundial e a necessidade urgente de investigação, de inovação e de infra-estruturas. A estratégia Europa 2020 e o investimento em iniciativas com valor acrescentado europeu foram temas recorrentes nos debates realizados durante o trabalho de preparação do relatório.
Encerramento da sessão  
Encontramo-nos de facto numa encruzilhada crucial relativamente ao futuro da Europa.
Encontramo-nos num momento em que a tecnologia digital e a Internet estão a criar, simultaneamente, grandes oportunidades e enormes desafios para o sector cultural e criativo da Europa.
Encontramo-nos, com efeito, numa fase crucial das nossas relações económicas com o Japão, e subsistem algumas questões que carecem de clarificação. Como tal, acolho com satisfação o presente debate e estou desejoso de escutar os vossos pontos de vista sobre a forma como deveremos conduzir esta relação nos próximos anos.
Encontrar áreas onde se possam fazer economias neste caso é por vezes obviamente muito difícil.
Encontrará sem dúvida mais apoio para a sua visão de uma política externa e de segurança comum aqui do que entre os 27 Ministros dos Negócios Estrangeiros, que merecem, todos eles, o meu respeito, mas que têm, todos eles, um problema: o facto de serem Ministros dos Negócios Estrangeiros dos diferentes países individualmente.
Encontrei exemplos concretos de má gestão no âmbito do meu trabalho como relator principal do orçamento da UE para o exercício de 2010, relativamente ao domínio "outras secções". Refiro-me ao domínio dos serviços de segurança, onde os custos com a segurança têm aumentado constantemente, ao domínio da tradução e à utilização eficaz dos recursos de tradução, bem como a outros domínios.
Encontrei-me com o Ministro da Energia de Alberta, que tem participado nas rondas de negociações, como certamente muitos outros. O Canadá também tem pressionado os Estados-Membros, e ameaçado confrontar-nos com a Organização Mundial do Comércio, caso este acordo seja introduzido.
Encontrámo-los, seguramente, não apenas nos nossos assistentes pessoais, mas também, acima de tudo, num óptimo secretariado.
Enfatiza, por conseguinte, a necessidade de a UE cooperar com as grandes potências regionais a fim de participar activamente na instauração e na melhoria de um ambiente internacional que permita à UE promover, como exigido pelo Tratado, os seus valores e interesses.
Enfatizo ainda que as estratégias territoriais devem estar directamente relacionadas com as linhas de orientação das redes transeuropeias de transportes, as estratégias da política marítima integrada e a Estratégia Europa 2020, por forma a construir um espaço europeu inteligente, sustentável e inclusivo.
Enfrentamos o desafio de fazer da economia europeia a economia mais competitiva do mundo e, em minha opinião, é inaceitável criar um encargo que resultará na fuga de capitais da Europa.
Enquanto Grupo dos Verdes, entendemos que há alguns serviços, especialmente os que se prendem com o interesse público geral, que são demasiado sensíveis e potencialmente demasiado vulneráveis para serem negociados ao abrigo desta abordagem da "lista negativa". Apresentámos algumas alterações e esperamos sinceramente algum apoio dos senhores deputados.
Enquanto Parlamento, é nossa missão promover a combinação daquilo que a investigação produz e aquilo que pode ser feito em termos de inovação. V. Exa. formulou a sua própria União da Inovação, com boas iniciativas, e depois há também os outros vários fundos, como os fundos estruturais, por exemplo, que podemos usar para este efeito.
Enquanto Presidência que promoveu relações de boa vizinhança com o Parlamento, esperamos que os resultados que nos deixaram à beira de um acordo não sejam desperdiçados.
Enquanto a Rússia tem demais, nós temos de menos. Só quando estivermos em pé de igualdade conseguirmos alcançar um acordo.
Enquanto a primeira agência abrange áreas fora da UE, a segunda actua dentro da UE, e as duas perseguem objectivos diferentes. A Fundação Europeia para a Formação auxilia essencialmente os países vizinhos, com reformas no sector da educação e formação, enquanto o CEDEFOP promove a recolha de informações e a investigação sobre as políticas de formação profissional dos Estados-Membros. A Comissão está empenhada em assegurar sinergias entre as duas agências, nomeadamente, através de intercâmbios de informação, de programas de trabalho conjuntos, da organização conjunta de conferências e seminários, e de projectos conjuntos.
Enquanto amigo da Bulgária, apesar de amigo crítico, pretendo fazer tudo ao meu alcance para apoiar o progresso deste país, mas não em detrimento do bem-estar do meu próprio país. Por conseguinte, abstive-me na votação. Aquando da adesão da Bulgária à UE em 1 de Janeiro de 2007, subsistiram fraquezas nos domínios da reforma judicial e do combate à corrupção e à criminalidade organizada.
Enquanto as normas ilegais do Conselho Antifascista de Libertação Popular da Jugoslávia (AVNOJ) e Beneš não constituem fundamentos para bloquear a adesão à UE, a política de restituição da Sérvia tem, com toda a certeza, de cumprir o estipulado pela UE.
Enquanto decorrem as investigações intensivas, devemos ter o cuidado de não saltar para conclusões precipitadas. A este propósito, remeto para as últimas informações vindas da Alemanha a respeito da suspeita de os brotos de feijão serem possivelmente a fonte de contaminação: referem eles que os ensaios laboratoriais não se encontram concluídos e que, por conseguinte, convém evitar conclusões prematuras.
Enquanto democrata-cristão, congratulo-me com as referências a Deus e ao cristianismo, uma vez que constituem uma parte essencial da nossa cultura e da nossa história, e considero que é muito melhor incluí-las do que excluí-las e criar uma sociedade descrente.
Enquanto deputado italiano do Parlamento Europeu, congratulo-me com a candidatura de Mario Draghi para Presidente do Banco Central Europeu (BCE). Assisti à sua audição no Parlamento Europeu, no dia 14 de Junho. A sua carreira de prestígio, desde as suas nomeações académicas, até às posições ao mais alto nível que ocupou no mundo económico e financeiro, enquanto presidente do Conselho de Estabilidade Financeira, fazem dele um candidato excepcional para o cargo de Presidente.
Enquanto deputado proveniente da Polónia, gostaria também de expressar a minha firme convicção de que a Presidência polaca do Conselho Europeu se empenhará num debate sério e extremamente realista.
Enquanto estes últimos resumem a Europa ao montante das suas contribuições, que gostariam de ver diminuir, e ao seu retorno financeiro, que gostariam de ver aumentar, este relatório defende políticas europeias integradas fortes, quer se trate de políticas históricas ou das novas competências atribuídas pelo Tratado de Lisboa.
Enquanto europeus, não devemos estar satisfeitos com a situação do sistema educativo europeu. Não podemos aceitar que um em cada sete dos nossos jovens abandone a escola sem as competências e as qualificações de que necessita para encontrar emprego e ter uma vida realizada.
Enquanto instituição, devemos dar o exemplo, ou seja, devemos ser também suficientemente corajosos para fazermos economias.
Enquanto isso, os comerciantes afirmam que as suas reservas em relação às transacções transfronteiriças se devem a diferenças nas legislações aplicáveis aos mercados dos diferentes Estados-Membros.
Enquanto nos desfazemos das ruínas deixadas pelos nossos colegas socialistas húngaros, estamos a mobilizar enormes esforços para tornar a Hungria um país democrático, europeu e livre com base no mandato constitucional que recebemos dos cidadãos húngaros em eleições livres. É este o motivo de adoptarmos a nova Constituição que irá finalmente substituir a Constituição comunista de 1949, que evocava más memórias e constituía um símbolo de tirania para os húngaros.
Enquanto o dinheiro dos contribuintes continuar a fluir em Bruxelas nas quantidades actuais, haverá sempre representantes de grupos de interesses sem escrúpulos, tal como, enquanto houver carcaças, haverá abutres.
Enquanto os académicos discutem sobre qual a melhor forma possível de medir o progresso, nós, enquanto deputados europeus, devemos ter confiança no método que escolhermos e certificar-nos de que não é passível de ser contestado, tanto no presente como no futuro.
Enquanto os responsáveis europeus não reconhecerem que as suas políticas são a causa fundamental das crises que persistem, vamos assistir a uma degradação da situação económica, social e política, a qual, inevitavelmente, há-de provocar mais tensões sociais e novos conflitos com consequências imprevisíveis. O que acontecerá enquanto não reconhecerem que a criação da moeda única, à imagem do marco alemão, assentou em pressupostos errados que apenas serviram interesses de grupos económicos e financeiros fortes. E que essa é a causa fundamental do agravamento das crises...
Enquanto os responsáveis europeus não reconhecerem que as suas políticas são a causa fundamental das crises que persistem, vamos assistir a uma degradação da situação económica, social e política, a qual, inevitavelmente, há-de provocar mais tensões sociais e novos conflitos...
Enquanto parceiros europeus, gostaríamos que o Azerbaijão mantivesse um diálogo permanente com a sociedade civil, que a imprensa desse país usufruísse de liberdade de expressão e pudesse funcionar sem quaisquer pressões políticas para fornecer informações correctas ao público, e que o acesso à Internet fosse livre e isento de censura, a fim de facilitar a comunicação entre o Azerbaijão e a Europa.
Enquanto país detentor de um estatuto tão excepcional, prometeu, ao assinar os acordos mútuos de parceria com a UE, aplicar os princípios da democracia, dos direitos humanos e do Estado de direito, que constituem condições essenciais para essa cooperação. A detenção injustificada de jornalistas, de representantes de organizações juvenis e de activistas civis, a proibição de protestos pacíficos e o recurso à força física contra manifestantes são, por conseguinte, inaceitáveis.
Enquanto relator para a reforma da PAC no horizonte 2020, regozijo-me por termos alcançado um compromisso transversal aos grupos.
Enquanto relator para o futuro da política estrutural, eu diria igualmente que a política de coesão europeia também devem ser incluída nesta questão. Felizmente, muitas regiões conseguiram ultrapassar o limiar de financiamento máximo de 75%. Contudo, se existe menos pobreza nas várias regiões da Europa, a solidariedade europeia também pode diminuir.
Enquanto relator-sombra do Grupo do PPE, considero que temos de integrar as autoridades regionais e locais na elaboração e execução de parcerias e proceder a uma concentração temática das prioridades e dos recursos financeiros a alocar no futuro. A dimensão regional deve estar presente e contribuir que seja evidenciado o valor acrescentado europeu da política de coesão. No que respeita aos instrumentos financeiros, a possibilidade de recorrer a instrumentos de engenharia financeira deve ser reforçada, assim como deve ser prevista a possibilidade de os Estados-Membros e as regiões utilizarem programas multifundos.
Enquanto relator-sombra do Grupo do Partido Popular Europeu (Democratas-Cristãos), estou muito satisfeito com o documento final, que servirá de orientação para as negociações com o Conselho, permitindo-nos aprovar o orçamento geral da União Europeia para 2012 no final de todo o processo. O documento identifica especificamente as prioridades do Parlamento Europeu, colocando a necessidade de um crescimento inteligente, sustentável e inclusivo, tal como consagrado na Estratégia Europa 2020, no centro da estratégia orçamental da UE para 2012.
Enquanto relatora de parecer da Comissão do Desenvolvimento no presente relatório, congratulo-me com a sua aprovação hoje no plenário do Parlamento Europeu. É essencial insistir na necessidade de harmonizar os esforços dos vários órgãos da ONU, a fim de melhor promover a eficiência e a eficácia das medidas relativas ao desenvolvimento. A ajuda ao desenvolvimento levada a cabo pelas Nações Unidas deve concentrar-se particularmente no cumprimento dos Objectivos de Desenvolvimento do Milénio, com uma atenção especial para os países menos desenvolvidos.
Enquanto relatora de parecer da Comissão do Emprego e dos Assuntos Sociais, gostaria de salientar a importância do papel desempenhado pela cultura e pela criatividade na economia europeia e na concretização das metas da Estratégia Europa 2020, para uma sociedade do conhecimento e da inovação, bem como pelos potenciais novos postos de trabalho que representam.
Enquanto relatora-sombra, apresentei uma alteração em nome do Grupo Confederal da Esquerda Unitária Europeia/Esquerda Nórdica Verde, relativa à etiquetagem de origem, à etiquetagem obrigatória de produtos de origem animal e à etiquetagem ética e ambiental.
Enquanto representante do Grupo do Partido Popular Europeu (Democratas-Cristãos), participei nos trabalhos e nas negociações relativos à Directiva relativa aos atrasos de pagamento, uma das propostas legislativas cruciais anunciadas nas versão original do "Small Business Act”. Espero que os Estados-Membros envidem todos os esforços para adoptarem as disposições deste documento da forma mais rápida e correcta possível. O "Small Business Act” é uma boa proposta para as pequenas e médias empresas.
Enquanto representantes dos interesses dos cidadãos da Europa, é necessário que contribuamos para definir uma política de defesa europeia.
Enquanto vice-presidente da Comissão dos Direitos da Mulher e da Igualdade dos Géneros, sinto-me obrigada a sublinhar a importância de cooperarmos, incluindo no exterior, tendo em vista eliminar a discriminação e a violência em razão do sexo das vítimas, para restabelecer a dignidade social das mulheres e restaurar o seu contributo activo tanto para a economia local como para a economia internacional.
Enriquece a vida das pessoas. A UE é conhecida pela sua diversidade cultural e representa simultaneamente uma comunidade de valores que se aplicam de igual modo a todos os cidadãos. Esses valores europeus, como o respeito dos direitos humanos, da democracia e das liberdades fundamentais, são também representados pelos nossos produtos culturais. A identidade cultural, os valores e a posição que a UE ocupa no palco mundial estão interligados.
Entendemos igualmente que é da maior importância que o reforço da governação económica seja acompanhado pelo reforço da legitimidade democrática da governação europeia.
Entendemos que a execução da supervisão orçamental deve estar sempre subordinada aos grandes objectivos da União Europeia e, em particular, às exigências do artigo 9 º do TFUE relacionadas com a promoção de um nível elevado de emprego, a garantia de uma protecção social adequada e a luta contra a exclusão social. É igualmente importante que o quadro de supervisão reforçada seja estabelecido no contexto do Semestre Europeu de coordenação das políticas.
Entendemos que a redacção do relatório, que subordina a política de coesão a condições que obrigam os Estados-Membros a adoptar reformas, é pouco clara e atreita a erros de interpretação. Escusado será dizer que a política de coesão tem de continuar a ser um instrumento que visa o equilíbrio social e a solidariedade em todas as regiões.
Entendemos ser chegada a hora de pôr em marcha uma iniciativa política europeia, conjuntamente com os nossos restantes parceiros, com vista à obtenção de um cessar-fogo e à realização de negociações que ponham fim ao regime de Kadhafi., dando início ao processo de transição para uma democracia inclusiva. É evidente que a intervenção militar da NATO dificilmente poderá resolver o que quer que seja e é bom que respeite escrupulosamente o mandato da resolução da ONU, evitando todo e qualquer uso desproporcionado da força.
Entendemos ser de fundamental importância melhorar a transparência dos processos de identificação das capturas totais e garantir a probidade de todos os mecanismos de combate à corrupção, mediante o reforço da responsabilidade do governo local. A União Europeia deve receber relatórios regulares sobre a aplicação do acordo a fim de facilitar a supervisão e promover a transparência e a coerência das políticas para o desenvolvimento.
Entendo ainda que as autorizações de importação contribuem efectivamente para monitorizar de forma eficiente a importação desta tipologia de produtos, salvaguardando de forma eficaz o seu impacto no tecido económico da UE e, consequentemente, de cada Estado-Membro.
Entendo ainda que os pequenos agricultores devem ter uma atenção especial já que dão um contributo importante para os objectivos da PAC.
Entendo que a Directiva definirá um quadro jurídico da União Europeia para a gestão do combustível irradiado e dos resíduos radioactivos e fará parte integrante da legislação da UE, garantindo uma utilização segura da energia nuclear naqueles EstadosMembros que a mantêm nos respectivos cabazes energéticos.
Entendo que a justificação para este facto é inteiramente política. O relatório também refere as inspecções realizadas na nossa fronteira com a Turquia, que cumpre os requisitos de Schengen e demonstra a nossa preparação. Espero sinceramente que este relatório seja aprovado na próxima sessão do Conselho Europeu porque quanto mais rapidamente actuarmos nesta questão, mais iremos ganhar - do ponto de vista político, económico e social.
Entendo que deve solicitar-se aos Estados-Membros em causa que informem o Parlamento Europeu e o Conselho, por escrito, num prazo de seis meses a contar da data de entrada em vigor da decisão em apreço, sobre a aplicação destas medidas suplementares e as soluções dadas às lacunas constatadas.
Entendo que não existe actualmente outro indicador que seja tão conciso ou completo. Não podemos apresentar aos nossos cidadãos, que têm os seus problemas quotidianos para resolver, uma ficha clínica com a descrição do estado de saúde da economia.
Entendo que o Galileu deve manter o seu orçamento actual.
Entendo que o sistema multilateral de comércio, representado pela OMC, continua a constituir, de longe, o quadro mais eficaz de consecução do comércio justo e equitativo a nível mundial; reitero o meu firme apoio a uma conclusão bem sucedida das negociações da Agenda de Doha, considerando preocupante que as negociações bilaterais perturbem a consecução desse objectivo.
Entendo que os impostos arrecadados deviam ter sido muito mais canalizados para o desenvolvimento de infra-estruturas de transportes mas, infelizmente, e como é frequente, o Conselho carece de boas ideias a este respeito.
Entendo que os testes de stress devem ser realizados não só no seio da União Europeia e nos países vizinhos, mas a nível global.
Entendo que precisamos de manter o orçamento da política de coesão e criar um modelo de ajuda equitativo para todas a regiões com um rendimento intermédio a fim de tornar os futuros investimentos da UE nas regiões transparentes e justos. O aumento de 5% do orçamento é razoável. Não é, como afirmam os eurocépticos, um exemplo de prodigalidade europeia, mas uma admissão corajosa de que, se não nos dotarmos de meios para construir a Europa, continuaremos isolados e impotentes.
Entendo que se pode e deve encontrar uma solução. Apelo, pois, aos senhores deputados para que procurem uma solução construtiva para a questão pendente durante os próximos dias e solicito também ao Conselho que responda, por seu lado, com uma abordagem construtiva.
Entendo que um governo eficaz dos riscos é um elemento principal e indispensável para evitar crises futuras.
Entendo que, a longo prazo, isto irá constituir uma base firme para o crescimento económico na Europa, mas mais importante do que o crescimento económico é recordar que é através deste processo que as pessoas, os jovens, podem crescer como indivíduos e europeus.
Entendo que, no combate aos problemas de asilo, a Dinamarca tem assumido uma posição precursora determinante para as regras a nível de toda a União Europeia.
Entendo também que, embora ambos os países tenham trabalhado arduamente em nome da livre circulação dos seus cidadãos na Europa, eles devem, em qualquer caso, continuar a alinhar os seus controlos e as suas regras com as normas europeias, dada a natureza delicada das fronteiras da Europa Oriental nos Balcãs.
Entendo, pois, que é correcto prosseguir no caminho dos acordos de parceria neste sector de importância vital para a economia europeia.
Entre 2006 e 2008, as PME conseguiram ganhar apenas 33% do volume total de contratos públicos.
Entre 9 e 15 de Janeiro de 2011, a maioria da população do Sudão do Sul pronunciou-se a favor da criação de um Estado independente.
Entre as conclusões a retirar, há que salientar que os custos de exploração destes programas se estimam em 800 milhões de euros anuais e que as receitas só por volta de 2030 ascenderão a 80 milhões de euros/ano.
Entre as muitas análises e respostas inteligentes, há uma questão que não foi colocada, ou seja, o que dirão os cidadãos dos contribuintes líquidos.
Entre as propostas do relatório, com as quais concordo e, por isso, votei favoravelmente, gostaria de salientar a necessidade de novas e diversificadas formações ao longo da vida, essenciais para um trabalho de maior qualidade, nomeadamente em contexto laboral, bem como a necessidade de uma atenção muito especial aos jovens, às mulheres e aos deficientes, conforme o plasmado na Estratégia "Europa 2020”.
Entre as várias formas de precariedade organizada, existe uma que é de mais difícil erradicação que as outras: a dos trabalhadores domésticos. O relatório em apreço apoia a elaboração de uma convenção da OIT para proteger os direitos desses trabalhadores e, especialmente, das trabalhadoras clandestinas.
Entre elas estão o acordo relativo à criação de um Fórum Consultivo sobre o Gás e o mecanismo actualizado de alerta precoce.
Entre eles inclui-se a questão de como será financiado o custo de manutenção anual do Galileo, estimado em 800 mil milhões de euros, assim que este estiver operacional; os possíveis riscos para a protecção de dados associados à utilização de serviços e aplicações do sistema global de navegação por satélite; e a necessidade premente de encontrar fundos complementares para garantir que as operações relacionadas com o Serviço Europeu Complementar de Navegação Geoestacionária (EGNOS) e com o sistema Galileo tenham rapidamente êxito.
Entre eles, os potenciais riscos para a protecção de dados e em particular a incerteza quanto à forma como será financiado o custo de manutenção anual do Galileo, que se estima rondar os 800 milhões de euros. A falta de clareza relativamente à sustentabilidade financeira de um projecto tão importante para a economia europeia, e, contudo, também tão ambicioso, exige uma abordagem cautelosa e objectiva.
Entre muitos outros, o ponto mais importante é o orçamento, que é, indubitavelmente, o único instrumento e o mais importante para construir o delicado equilíbrio entre a consolidação das contas públicas e a necessidade de apoiar o crescimento. É o único verdadeiro baluarte que temos contra o risco de a consolidação deprimir a economia europeia de uma forma severa, ainda que reversível. O orçamento é, portanto, um instrumento fulcral.
Entre os aspectos mais relevantes, destacamos: a necessidade de se fazer uma avaliação exaustiva e pormenorizada das causas da insuficiente realização dos objectivos em matéria de cooperação para o desenvolvimento e das diversas linhas de apoio ao sector das pescas na Mauritânia; a defesa do apoio à construção, o mais rápido possível, de instalações adequadas para o desembarque de peixe ao longo da costa central e meridional da Mauritânia (incluindo Nouakchott), de modo a que o pescado capturado nas águas mauritanas possa ser desembarcado em portos nacionais e não fora do país, como é frequente acontecer actualmente; que os acordos de pesca entre a UE e países terceiros devem ser precedidos de um amplo debate nos países interessados que permita a participação do público, de organizações da sociedade civil e dos parlamentos nacionais, promovendo desta forma uma maior democracia e transparência.
Entre os aspectos negativos, e apesar dos esforços da senhora baronesa Ashton, temos as diferentes bitolas usadas para avaliar os casos da Líbia e da Síria no Conselho de Segurança das Nações Unidas, bem como no Conselho de Ministros da União Europeia.
Entre os objectivos da Estratégia "Europa 2020” contam-se a redução das taxas de abandono escolar para menos de 10% e o aumento da proporção dos jovens que completam o ensino superior para pelo menos 40%. Esses objectivos inscrevem-se na ambição europeia, apresentada pela primeira vez na Estratégia de Lisboa, de fazer da União a economia baseada no conhecimento mais competitiva de todo o mundo. É por isso que o processo de Copenhaga - que, desde 2002, tem vindo a criar as bases de uma maior cooperação no desenvolvimento das políticas dos Estados-Membros em matéria de ensino e formação profissionais - se reveste de particular importância.
Entre os principais avanços, gostaria de referir dois: o período de reflexão, que foi prolongado para 14 dias, e a apresentação do resumo contendo toda a informação e o preço total a pagar antes do clique final de confirmação da encomenda.
Entre outras coisas, criticamos o facto de não haver um compromisso claro no sentido de uma abordagem muito mais decidida de combate à pobreza.
Entre outras coisas, trata-se da dívida externa ou de um excesso de desequilíbrios externos em que os mercados se focaram, e tal significa claramente que na nossa resposta à situação temos de ir mais além do ajustamento orçamental.
Entre outras fontes de financiamento possíveis, o relatório propõe também que se considere a possibilidade de introduzir pagamentos por serviços ecossistémicos às empresas, através dos quais contribuem para a conservação da biodiversidade e a protecção das florestas. A par de diversas outras medidas, como o reforço da coordenação a nível da UE e do intercâmbio de informações entre os Estados-Membros, a Comissão é também exortada a considerar a apresentação de uma proposta legislativa que proíba a construção em terrenos desbravados por acção de incêndios comprovadamente resultantes de fogo posto.
Entre outras, destaco a marcação de origem, ou seja, a introdução de um requisito relativo à indicação do país de origem de produtos têxteis importados de países terceiros. A actual ausência de regras harmonizadas relativamente à marcação de origem coloca a UE em desvantagem em relação aos seus principais parceiros comerciais, como é o caso do Canadá, da China, do Japão e dos EUA, que requerem a marcação de origem para os bens importados. A marcação de origem facilitaria a escolha dos consumidores e contribuiria para a redução de indicações de origem fraudulentas, imprecisas ou enganadoras.
Entre outros aspectos, propomos o reforço da cooperação entre os sectores cultural e criativo e as universidades europeias, aumentando o número de formações especializadas para jovens e melhorando a mobilidade de todos os criadores e agentes culturais.
Entre outros exemplos, propomos a manutenção do sistema de quotas de produção de leite como uma condição essencial para a defesa dos produtores dos países mais sensíveis; defendemos a manutenção dos direitos de plantação da vinha e a manutenção das ajudas à destilação em álcool de boca e à destilação de crise; propomos a criação de um seguro agrícola público, financiado por Fundos comunitários, que garanta um rendimento mínimo aos agricultores em casos de catástrofe natural; apresentámos propostas para uma agricultura social e ambientalmente sustentável, uma visão incompatível com desbragadas profissões de fé no mercado e na competitividade, como faz este relatório.
Entre outros requisitos, contam-se a cooperação entre os Estados-Membros e a preparação de uma posição comum em matéria de, nomeadamente, poupança e cortes orçamentais. A UE e os Estados-Membros têm de avançar no sentido de reforçar o papel e a posição da UE no seio da ONU (alterações no apoio à ONU, especialmente em matéria de políticas e ajuda humanitárias e a questão da resolução de conflitos).
Entretanto, a Comissão Europeia continua a negociar acordos de comércio livre que, em geral, apenas servem interesses de grupos económicos e financeiros e não dão a atenção devida aos direitos laborais, não promovem o direito de negociação colectiva e de livre associação nem tomam medidas quanto à eliminação efectiva da discriminação em matéria de emprego, de profissão, à eliminação do trabalho forçado ou do trabalho precário e mal pago, incluindo também do trabalho infantil.
Entretanto, a Europa deve acompanhar atentamente a situação na Hungria e encorajar os democratas húngaros a retomarem a iniciativa.
Entretanto, a avaliação Schengen da Roménia e da Bulgária foi concluída em todos os capítulos em Março, com um resultado positivo.
Entretanto, devemos ponderar a criação de um visto cultural para artistas e demais trabalhadores do sector da cultura.
Entretanto, espero, em primeiro lugar, que consigamos apoio suficiente em plenária para nos permitir prosseguir e demonstrar que a Europa também toma decisões que são positivas para os seus cidadãos. Em segundo lugar, espero que um certo número de Estados-Membros comece efectivamente a fazer uso das novas oportunidades e seja capaz de, com o peso dos seus bons resultados, seduzir outros Estados-Membros a participar.
Entretanto, na Grécia, o povo tem a sensação de isto de poupar e tornar a poupar nunca mais tem fim.
Entretanto, o Conselho e o Parlamento têm uma enorme responsabilidade que vai para além do acordo, porque terão de decidir se querem continuar com as más práticas que levaram à fragilização do Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento e, indirectamente, à crise, ou se pretendem pôr termo à política de negociatas e de acordos ao nível dos EstadosMembros e abrir espaço a uma nova abordagem das políticas económicas que proporcione soluções europeias comuns, se baseie em regras estabelecidas em comum e dê ensejo a que finalmente se conclua a aplicação da vertente de economia política da integração, dando ênfase à construção de uma Europa forte.
Entretanto, o Hamas está a tornar bem claro que merece realmente figurar na lista de organizações terroristas.
Entretanto, o espectro da intolerância religiosa alarga a sua sombra - vimos os recentes acontecimentos no Egipto -, encontrando a sua justificação em tempos incertos para suscitar o medo e causar a destruição. A liberdade de religião e de crença é um direito humano universal que deve ser protegido em qualquer lado do mundo.
Entretanto, porém, importa garantir a aplicação uniforme do instrumento em todos os Estados-Membros, com o estabelecimento de uma verdadeira distinção entre crimes graves, aos quais se destina e que sanciona, e crimes que não são considerados graves.
Entretanto, temos de continuar a trabalhar com vista a salvaguardar a estabilidade financeira e, assim, proteger a recuperação económica da Europa, que é fundamental para um crescimento sustentável e para melhorar o emprego.
Entrou ultimamente em vigor, em Março, uma nova directiva que estabelece medidas de combate aos atrasos de pagamento nas transacções comerciais, o que constituirá um contributo importante para melhorar a prática de pagamentos na Europa.
Então por que razão não temos isso mesmo a nível europeu? Porque é que os Estados-Membros continuam a não se responsabilizarem por 80% da despesa da UE? Reitero aqui o meu pedido ao Conselho para que comece finalmente a trabalhar nas declarações nacionais dos Estados-Membros.
Então vamos subsidiar-nos uns aos outros! Isto não faz sentido. É a política da pedincha - o que os americanos chamam pork-barrel - a entrar aqui, no Parlamento.
Então, e só então, os pacotes de verdadeira austeridade poderão resultar. Só então o povo grego aceitará os cortes que são necessários.
Então, intervindo a título pessoal, preocupa-me que estas preferências comerciais de emergência possam parecer recompensar o Governo paquistanês pela sua falta de acção neste domínio.
Então, o que aconteceu, Senhor Presidente da Comissão? Um ministro do interior da Liga Norte, em Itália, diz que os tunisinos falam todos francês - o que é bom, significa que todos eles poderão receber autorizações de residência Schengen e seguir para França. Naturalmente, o Presidente francês pergunta se perderam o juízo. Então, agora, todos os tunisinos que chegam a Itália querem ir para França? Querem empurrá-los todos para aqui, não é? Nesse caso, vamos fechar a fronteira.
Enviarei a todos outra mensagem electrónica dentro de alguns minutos, para lembrar este exercício e para lhes dar instruções pormenorizadas sobre o que devem fazer quando o alarme soar e em que consiste o mesmo.
Enviemos, pois, uma mensagem forte à Comissão Europeia e aos produtores agrícolas da Europa, mostrando o nosso apoio a uma PAC mais justa, mais simples e mais flexível.
Envolve uma política de investimento comum da União Europeia no contexto da política comercial internacional, com todos os seus efeitos concomitantes na situação da UE e dos Estados-Membros em matéria de política social, económica e de emprego, tendo em conta os interesses dos grupos financeiros, das grandes empresas e das actividades económicas, por um lado e, por outro, dos sindicatos e trabalhadores.
Era evidente no seu semblante que estavam cientes de que não existiam provas concretas contra o rapaz; as provas eram contraditórias, os testemunhos pareciam ser engendrados pela polícia, e nunca deveria ter sido extraditado.
Era necessário estimular a investigação fundamental e, acertadamente, foi criado o Conselho Europeu de Investigação, que no futuro deverá combinar melhor a excelência e a coesão. Havia necessidade de mais investigadores e foram introduzidas as acções Marie Curie, que requerem ainda um esforço suplementar.
Era particularmente importante para nós que, antes da atribuição do espectro, tivessem sido adoptados regulamentos claros destinados a evitar que os teatros ou outras pessoas usando microfones sem fios, por exemplo, sejam confrontados com custos de mudança de frequência ou de novas tecnologias.
Era uma verdadeira oportunidade para a União Europeia mostrar como contribui de forma tangível para melhorar as vidas dos cidadãos europeus. O regulamento proposto teria sido um meio particularmente adequado para responder a questões controversas sobre alimentos provenientes de animais clonados, tornando mais rigorosas as disposições de regulamento de 1997.
Eram estas as questões que o nosso grupo queria referir como exemplos a discutir, pois estes serão os aspectos que nos darão credibilidade quando, mais tarde, solicitarmos fundos.
Escolhi apenas dois exemplos específicos que demonstram que estamos a fazer progressos e que o problema está nos pormenores.
Escrevi ao Ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros do Iraque e voltei a falar com ele ontem. Não questiono a soberania do Iraque sobre todo o seu território, mas considero que o país tem o dever de proteger os direitos humanos dos residentes de Ashraf.
Escusado será dizer que concluir um acordo com a Índia, neste momento, é não só de enorme valor económico mas também de grande importância estratégica. A Índia está tão-só no começo de um percurso de desenvolvimento que a tornará um dos actores-chave da economia deste século.
Escusado será dizer que, quanto mais educarmos os nossos jovens em toda a Europa, mais alegre nos parecerá o futuro num contexto mundial muito exigente.
Escutei com particular agrado a observação do Senhor Comissário em relação aos medicamentos genéricos e ao facto de que não haverá risco de um impacto negativo para os pacientes. Já me desloquei à Índia muitas vezes, e também a países em desenvolvimento, e aí ouvi os pacientes com Sida afirmarem quão importante é para eles terem acesso a medicamentos baratos.
Escutei o que foi dito acerca da ecologização. A ecologização possui diferentes significados para diferentes pessoas em diferentes países, incluindo no que diz respeito à forma como é aplicada. É necessário que nos ocupemos desta matéria. A ecologização não é um simples chavão que possamos utilizar de forma leviana, porque ela terá consequências tremendas para todos.
Esforçámo-nos durante os últimos cinco meses, e fá-lo-emos igualmente durante o tempo que ainda nos resta, por transmitir isto mesmo e para que o Conselho determine que, no que diz respeito às normas técnicas, a Roménia e a Bulgária estão aptas a integrar o espaço Schengen.
Especialmente o Parlamento Europeu está a convidar Sudaneses e Sudaneses do Sul a proporem planos específicos, tendo em conta questões sensíveis, designadamente a questão da cidadania, a partilha da dívida e dos rendimentos do petróleo.
Especificamente, não apoio o apelo do deputado Audy ao aumento do financiamento destinado ao Conselho Europeu de Investigação e a torná-lo uma entidade jurídica independente, dotada de poder de decisão e directamente responsável pela sua estratégia científica e pela sua gestão administrativa.
Espera-se que este relatório possa fortalecer o núcleo duro dos parâmetros de trabalho incorporado na legislação da Organização Internacional de Trabalho.
Espera-se que quaisquer actores que procurem influenciar o processo decisório e a implementação de políticas a nível europeu participem no registo comum, que facilitará o registro e o acesso a informações sobre os representantes de grupos de interesses ("lobbyists"). Àqueles que não se registarem ser-lhes-á negado o cartão de acesso de longo prazo às instalações do Parlamento Europeu.
Esperam-se despesas suplementares dentro de poucos anos, para além das despesas inicialmente previstas no programa, e creio que é provável que sejam necessários montantes adicionais para concluir o projecto.
Esperamos ainda que a Comissão - e tenho a certeza de que a senhora Comissária Vassiliou vai tomar medidas para assegurar que isso aconteça - apresente um Livro Branco sobre as indústrias culturais e criativas logo que possível, a fim de reforçar esta estratégia trans-sectorial na UE e nos Estados-Membros. O corte de fundos para a cultura e a educação em tempo de crise - como o meu país está a fazer, com o pretexto de que a cultura não é essencial à sobrevivência - significa não investir no futuro e num crescimento inteligente e inclusivo; significa não compreender que a cultura é essencial à vida.
Esperamos ainda que a Rússia contribua de forma positiva para a resolução do conflito do Nagorno-Karabakh. Não é a questão do fornecimento de armas relativamente a ambas as partes que está em causa, mas a mediação pacífica entre os dois lados do conflito.
Esperamos igualmente que a discussão e a apresentação das nossas perguntas e preocupações possam conduzir a um aperfeiçoamento e a uma melhor preparação da legislação de execução já referida.
Esperamos que a adesão ao espaço de Schengen se torne uma realidade e que não tenhamos de esperar até Setembro.
Esperamos que a proposta que os senhores irão apresentar em 29 de Junho seja conforme às recomendações efectuadas no nosso relatório.
Esperamos que as futuras alterações à legislação sobre a reforma do sistema judicial tomem em consideração a declaração da Comissão de Veneza do Conselho da Europa e eliminem estas preocupações.
Esperamos que dentro de pouco tempo conheçamos melhor certos aspectos da segurança alimentar devido à investigação científica e ao progresso.
Esperamos que isso nos permita aumentar a confiança.
Esperamos que no seu relatório a Comissão se debruce com especial atenção sobre estas questões. Entretanto, esta legislação permitirá uma autorização rápida de fibras têxteis novas.
Esperamos que se possa avançar em breve com a aprovação de legislação que regulamente as indicações de origem também neste sector.
Esperamos que tenham uma visita frutuosa e sabemos que vão acompanhar com interesse o relatório do senhor deputado Cadec sobre o acordo de parceria no sector da pesca entre a União Europeia e a República das Seicheles, que será posto à votação amanhã. Tudo o que pedimos é que na próxima visita tragam um pouco de sol a Bruxelas.
Esperamos que, em Junho, com base numa negociação tripartida, a 100.ª sessão da Conferência Internacional do Trabalho faça avançar esta Convenção e esta recomendação. São essenciais para legalizar uma relação que com demasiada frequência se baseia na exploração. Esperamos que se possa obter o reconhecimento jurídico do trabalho doméstico.
Esperamos, além disso, uma cooperação aprofundada no domínio da imigração ilegal, a melhoria dos controlos nas fronteiras e um intercâmbio mais eficaz de informações sobre o terrorismo e a criminalidade organizada.
Esperamos, portanto, que seja envidado um grande esforço para simplificar os procedimentos de registo no sistema burocrático da Índia, que é muito oneroso, talvez mesmo mais oneroso do que o europeu, o que diz tudo.
Esperava-se que a nova constituição húngara - 20 anos após a queda do regime comunista e num momento em que a Hungria assume a Presidência da União Europeia - reflectisse cabalmente os valores mais estimados na UE. Serão estes valores apenas valores políticos? Admito que, enquanto liberal, estou preocupada com a possibilidade de o governo minar as liberdades cívicas e o controlo democrático.
Esperemos que a nova legislação venha a simplificar as disposições actuais em matéria de etiquetagem.
Esperemos que isso contribua para um combate mais eficaz ao imundo comércio de peles de cães e gatos que são usadas como ornamento em peças de vestuário lançadas ilegalmente no nosso mercado.
Esperemos que o referendo venha pôr fim ao conflito e que definitivamente se entre num processo de paz duradouro. A UE vai ter um papel importante nos futuros desenvolvimentos dessa região e não pode abdicar do seu importante papel na pacificação da região.
Espero dessa decisão de responsabilidade, essencialmente, que se perceba que as questões económicas e financeiras são cruciais e decisivas para a Europa, mas que as questões económicas e financeiras são instrumentais para aquela que é a finalidade principal da Europa, que é a finalidade de manter a paz.
Espero pois que, amanhã, os senhores deputados estejam preparados para responder ao desafio que este tão importante pacote legislativo representa para o Parlamento, que pela primeira vez na sua história está a exercer os seus poderes de co-legislador, à semelhança do Conselho.
Espero que a Alta Representante e Vice-Presidente da Comissão, Baronesa Ashton, assim como a própria Comissão, transmitam a nossa inquietude ao Governo do Azerbaijão face à supressão da democracia nesse país, e que exijam medidas correctivas imediatas.
Espero que a Comissão apresente propostas concretas de introdução de normas laborais e sociais aperfeiçoadas, e propostas sobre a promoção da responsabilidade social das empresas nas suas políticas externas.
Espero que a Comissão clarifique dúvidas no que respeita à igualdade de oportunidades para investigadores e coordenadores das várias regiões e países comunitários, desde que, evidentemente, satisfaçam o requisito de excelência científica.
Espero que a Comissão venha a ter em consideração esta questão e que sugira uma solução. Durante a votação manifestei também o meu apoio aos pequenos produtores agrícolas, bem como ao fornecimento de combustível mais barato e impostos indirectos mais baixos para os produtores agrícolas. O relatório do senhor deputado Deß também vai ao encontro da minha proposta de maior flexibilidade no segundo pilar.
Espero que a Europa saiba dotar-se dos meios para promover a sua cultura, para que o seu modelo e o seu património possam influenciar outros, para que a Europa possa defender a sua identidade e desenvolver a sua economia.
Espero que a chamada de atenção para os bons exemplos de balcões únicos seja seguida de maiores esforços para melhorar o funcionamento de todos eles, para que sirvam realmente os interesses das pequenas e médias empresas.
Espero que a condicionalidade ex ante seja totalmente integrada no processo de programação. Espero também que as condicionalidades ex ante estejam directamente ligadas à política e à eficácia da programação, que o seu número seja limitado, que sejam adaptadas ao contexto específico e que respeitem os critérios acordados.
Espero que a declaração do Conselho amanhã seja positiva e que nos garanta um resultado positivo, e quero agradecer a todos aqueles que contribuíram para esse resultado positivo.
Espero que a inclusão do Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento no orçamento, que eu também reivindico - essa coisa evasiva, esse acontecimento sempre anunciado mas nunca concretizado - consiga preservar a natureza original do Fundo.
Espero que a revisão do código das PME consiga de facto simplificar a burocracia, garantir o acesso ao crédito e a sua recuperação e facilite a internacionalização.
Espero que a votação de amanhã envie uma mensagem clara e positiva aos deputados europeus sobre a adesão da Roménia e da Bulgária ao espaço Schengen.
Espero que a votação de hoje encoraje uma melhor harmonização das regras para os fundos e programas europeus ao abrigo dos quais há projectos de desenvolvimento urbano e local que são elegíveis para co-financiamento, a fim de minimizar, tanto quanto possível, a burocracia e erros potenciais na implementação.
Espero que amanhã, na reunião extraordinária de Ministros da Agricultura da União Europeia, estes prejuízos causados aos agricultores sejam, em primeiro lugar, reparados sem exclusões, e, em segundo lugar, que se extraiam ensinamentos, nomeadamente quanto à forma como se deve proceder numa situação que causou efectivamente vítimas mortais, mas causou igualmente danos aos produtos de muitos países, como o meu, a Espanha. Há que extrair lições desta crise.
Espero que as inevitáveis lições deste incidente sejam, de facto, aprendidas.
Espero que as taxas mais baixas impostas aos veículos menos poluentes levem os proprietários das empresas de transporte que ainda não o tenham feito a renovar as suas frotas.
Espero que consigamos pô-lo em prática a uma escala mais vasta, utilizando os fundos de forma ainda mais eficaz.
Espero que depois da votação o Parlamento e o Conselho se sentem para conseguir rapidamente um acordo nesta matéria.
Espero que ele dê continuidade ao trabalho com a mesma dinâmica.
Espero que esta confiança se mantenha a longo prazo, para que possamos manter esta liberdade de circulação, esta liberdade de nos deslocarmos dentro da União Europeia, como um bem público maior no longo prazo.
Espero que esta questão possa ser discutida na cimeira de Nizhny Novgorod.
Espero que este Conselho envie uma mensagem forte e clara nesse sentido, salientando a necessidade dos EstadosMembros respeitarem e implementarem de forma correcta e efectiva as regras de Schengen, chamando a atenção para a necessidade de uma maior solidariedade e partilha de responsabilidades entre os EstadosMembros, um reforço das competências da Frontex e dos seus meios e a necessidade de se criar um verdadeiro mecanismo de avaliação de Schengen que verifique o cumprimento das regras e os controlos nas fronteiras e que permita identificar problemas, ajudar a resolvê-los e em último recurso sancionar os EstadosMembros em caso de continuado incumprimento.
Espero que este ano o processo seja mais suave e menos atribulado do que o processo orçamental relativo a 2011.
Espero que este tipo de problema, o adiamento da quitação do Conselho pelo Parlamento, nunca mais se repita e peço por isso que ainda durante a Presidência húngara realizemos uma discussão política e cheguemos a acordo.
Espero que isso aconteça já agora e espero também, Senhor Presidente em exercício do Conselho, que transmita a mensagem ao Conselho e aos Estados-Membros que, a partir de 2014, o Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento terá de fazer parte integrante do orçamento da União. Obviamente, não se deve daí depreender que se deve permitir que esta operação conduza a cortes em recursos que por regra se destinam à cooperação para o desenvolvimento.
Espero que isso possa encorajar a inovação nos têxteis e no vestuário, tornando mais fácil para os consumidores a possibilidade de beneficiarem de produtos inovadores.
Espero que leve ao Conselho dos Ministros da Agricultura este forte sinal do Parlamento Europeu.
Espero que na Áustria, em particular, tenham sido retiradas lições deste caso no que respeita a abordar e sopesar de uma forma sensível os interesses da economia e do ambiente e, portanto, que o caso tenha um impacto positivo no futuro.
Espero que num futuro próximo consigamos igualmente chegar a um entendimento acerca da indicação da origem dos artigos.
Espero que o Conselho também chegue rapidamente a uma conclusão positiva em relação aos passos decisivos dados por este Parlamento para assegurar a rastreabilidade e a adequada informação sobre os produtos.
Espero que o Conselho tenha devidamente em conta a nossa posição. Uma das questões mais polémicas neste debate consiste em saber se se deve ou não autorizar a exportação de resíduos nucleares para países não pertencentes à UE. Apoiei claramente a opção de proibir as exportações para países terceiros, contrariamente a propostas inicialmente apresentadas.
Espero que o Governo de Israel aprecie devidamente as oportunidades que este acordo com a Palestina proporciona.
Espero que o Governo ponha fim a este tipo de tratamento desigual e estabeleça condições iguais para todos. A directiva prevê ainda um incentivo à renovação da frota: quanto mais recente e menos poluentes forem os veículos, menos impostos pagarão. Isso exige grandes investimentos às empresas de transporte, que terão, na verdade, um retorno muito rápido, quer devido a uma tarifação mais baixa, quer a um consumo de combustível inferior.
Espero que o Parlamento chegue a um acordo final e aprove, o mais rapidamente possível, a totalidade do pacote em matéria de governação económica, de modo a transmitir uma mensagem forte e coesa para a opinião pública e pôr fim à especulação.
Espero que o Parlamento chegue a um acordo final e que aprove a totalidade do pacote de governação o mais rapidamente possível de modo a enviar uma mensagem forte e unificada ao público e aos mercados e a pôr fim à especulação.
Espero que o clima na Cimeira Europeia de Junho, na qual este tópico será examinado, não seja contaminado por sentimentos populistas.
Espero que o cumprimento dessas recomendações seja rigorosamente acompanhado, especialmente no que se refere às fronteiras entre a Bulgária, a Grécia e a Turquia, pois, como sabem, a confiança mútua entre os Estados Schengen assenta no pleno respeito, por esses Estados, das suas obrigações recíprocas.
Espero que o nosso acordo do "pacote de seis medidas” abra caminho à conversão destes instrumentos em mecanismos comunitários.
Espero que o relatório se revele útil para determinar politicamente, e incentivar a redefinição do papel da União Europeia em organizações internacionais.
Espero que os representantes das instituições europeias oiçam com atenção e acompanhem a situação na Hungria, e que profiram uma declaração inequívoca muito em breve sobre a invalidação das fronteiras e do Tratado de Paris, e sobre a Constituição húngara, que consagra os direitos colectivos das minorias húngaras e a criação de domínios colectivos de autodeterminação.
Espero que possamos afirmar no Conselho, antes de a Presidência húngara chegar ao fim, que a preparação técnica foi terminada.
Espero que possamos melhorar o relatório amanhã. Se o fizermos, o nosso grupo terá todo o prazer em apoiá-lo.
Espero que possamos ultrapassar as últimas divergências durante as próximas semanas para podermos finalizar um acordo antes do Verão. Isto é muito importante, porque o meu grupo está a trabalhar para ter uma votação final no plenário em Julho.
Espero que seja dado, brevemente, um segundo passo para a criação de normas mais rigorosas que garantam a consistente integridade da administração pública da União e o reforço das suas regras institucionais.
Espero que surjam rapidamente propostas concretas para lutar contra os preconceitos e as discriminações, para combater a ilegalidade e para promover os direitos humanos, a dignidade humana e a paz.
Espero que todas as instituições tenham retirado as devidas ilações da crise financeira, económica e social que teima em não nos largar.
Espero que todos os EstadosMembros tenham aprendido as lições da crise, nomeadamente a de que um orçamento equilibrado e uma disciplina orçamental forte são recompensados pela diminuição dos custos de financiamento nos mercados financeiros e que a honestidade nos relatórios estatísticos é essencial para uma confiança contínua dos mercados.
Espero que, com este apoio, nós possamos dar-lhe um pequeno impulso adicional para propor Christine Lagarde como a próxima detentora do cargo de Director-Geral do FMI.
Espero que, durante a votação de amanhã, o bom senso prevaleça sobre as ambições de redução de CO2, que são economicamente infundadas.
Espero que, finalmente, as pessoas entendam que o público está realmente cansado das economias que lhes dizem respeito mas não das economias que nos dizem respeito.
Espero que, nos próximos meses, os problemas sejam resolvidos de forma pacífica.
Espero sinceramente que a Comissão encontre outro caminho para testar a cultura de segurança.
Espero sinceramente que isto conduza, por exemplo, à eliminação dos milhares de milhões em subsídios que têm um efeito nefasto no ambiente e na natureza que ainda temos neste mundo.
Espero sinceramente que o desenvolvimento e a colocação em prática dos sistemas, das aplicações e das soluções especificados no relatório decorram conforme planeado e que, já nos próximos anos, seja possível aplicar as diversas soluções, facilitando a vida das empresas e dos cidadãos e aumentando a segurança no mar, no ar e nas estradas.
Espero sinceramente que o nosso relator, o senhor deputado Coelho, defenda as prerrogativas do Parlamento, como sempre faz com grande êxito e com o nosso total apoio.
Espero sinceramente que, aquando da assembleia interparlamentar agendada para Junho, tenhamos conseguido a libertação de todas essas pessoas, incluindo de Eynulla Fatullayev, director de um jornal, e que o Governo e as suas entidades tenham cumprido finalmente as suas promessas.
Espero também que venhamos a discutir que actividades subsidiárias serão adequadas de um ponto de vista ético quando temos um trabalho a fazer como deputados ao Parlamento Europeu.
Espero, Senhora Comissária, que nos Livros Verdes que propõe, leve estas questões em consideração e que possamos contar em breve com uma plataforma comum de direitos mínimos aplicável a todos os Estados-Membros.
Espero, contudo, que o Conselho se torne rapidamente parte no acordo e que haja também um rápido e amplo consenso nesta Assembleia, que constituirá um veemente sinal do dever de transparência e também um apelo à acção. Espero que a votação se aproxime da unanimidade.
Espero, efectivamente, que o Parlamento chegue a um acordo final e aprove, o mais rapidamente possível, a totalidade do pacote em matéria de governação económica, de modo a transmitir uma mensagem forte e coesa para a opinião pública e a pôr fim à especulação.
Espero, obviamente, que o resultado da reunião extraordinária de amanhã seja a reparação sem exclusões e o regresso à normalidade, para que os produtos que estão em perfeitas condições possam circular em toda União Europeia e no mundo em geral.
Espero, por conseguinte, que possamos aproveitar esta dinâmica das negociações para apresentar, muito em breve, uma proposta sobre a matéria.
Espero, por isso, que a minha informação esteja incorrecta e que os polícias, que desempenham um serviço no interesse destes países e da segurança de toda a União Europeia, continuem a ser bem pagos no futuro, para que não fiquem susceptíveis ao suborno
Espero, portanto, que a Comissão e o Comité se empenhem verdadeiramente em assegurar que os Estados-Membros - grandes ou pequenos -, tomem medidas concretas. A Espanha já deu o exemplo desenvolvendo um certo volume trabalho; esperamos que os outros a sigam.
Espero, portanto, que este pacote seja definitivamente aprovado antes das férias de Verão e, sobretudo, aplicado o mais rapidamente possível, para que a União Europeia não seja apanhada sem estar preparada, como no passado, para responder aos desafios que ameaçam a sua estabilidade.
Espero, portanto, que todos os outros grupos políticos aceitem prestar este serviço ao nosso Comissário, que, acrescentaria, está neste momento a trabalhar com grande afinco.
Esperávamos que nos apoiasse, Senhor Comissário Dalli. Não compreendemos por que razão o Conselho não esteve do nosso lado, pois o Conselho é constituído por representantes eleitos dos Estados-Membros.
Essa a razão por que a Comissão vos está explicitamente a oferecer, a todos, a possibilidade de rever a directiva no momento certo, de modo a podermos aprender com as nossas experiências e melhorar ainda mais esta directiva.
Essa a razão por que desejo, uma vez mais, expressar a minha mais profunda solidariedade com o povo japonês.
Essa a razão por que o meu grupo deseja salientar um certo número de aspectos destas negociações, que deverão culminar num acordo que ajude a alcançar os objectivos do desenvolvimento sustentável e da erradicação da pobreza, acordo que deverá ser acompanhado por compromissos inequívocos e verificáveis, com base, evidentemente, na cooperação, mas, também, por sérios compromissos sociais e ambientais.
Essa a razão por que saudei igualmente a introdução destas novas contas económicas do ambiente europeias e propus alargar o seu âmbito a outros módulos.
Essa a razão por que é tão importante promover a liberdade de circulação dos trabalhadores dentro da União Europeia.
Essa a razão por que é tão importante que o Parlamento envie de novo um sinal forte ao Canadá neste momento. Não iremos abdicar desta peça de legislação, para a qual trabalhámos durante tanto tempo, dentro e fora da União. Espero que amanhã um grande número de colegas dê o seu apoio a uma alteração que apresentei em conjunto com outros deputados.
Essa alteração é consistente com a percepção cada vez mais negativa dos imigrantes, que alimenta a xenofobia.
Essa atribuição de fundos apenas resulta em despedimentos financiados. A decisão em causa é ainda mais inaceitável numa altura em que a União Europeia e os seus Estados-Membros estão a adoptar medidas de austeridade e de redução orçamental que irão contribuir para a recessão económica, desmantelamento dos serviços públicos, desemprego, precariedade laboral, cortes salariais, bem como para as desigualdades sociais.
Essa coerência implica também uma resposta séria à exigência de inovação manifestada pelo público, pelos destinatários das políticas da UE e pelos grupos sociais e indústrias da Europa.
Essa convenção irá permitir-nos lutar de forma mais eficaz contra as condições de trabalho inaceitáveis de demasiados trabalhadores desse sector, que são predominantemente mulheres e, em muitos casos, trabalhadores imigrantes, particularmente, imigrantes clandestinos. A convenção irá complementar outras convenções da OIT e de outras organizações internacionais. O Parlamento Europeu defendeu também a ratificação pela UE e respectivos Estados-Membros da Convenção Internacional sobre a Protecção dos Direitos de Todos os Trabalhadores Migrantes.
Essa estratégia deve visar tanto a protecção das florestas como a utilização sustentável dos recursos madeireiros, na medida em que as florestas oferecem soluções para as alterações climáticas.
Essa indicação está, de facto, contida na proposta de regulamento sobre a marcação de origem "fabricado em"​​, aprovada nesta Câmara em 21 de Outubro de 2010, que introduz um mecanismo de controlo e visa simplificar a legislação em vigor, na perspectiva da criação de um enquadramento legislativo melhor e mais claro para as empresas e para a protecção dos consumidores.
Essa informação contribuirá para que decidamos a necessidade de o actualizar, a fim de garantir a sua devida aplicação.
Essa modificação deve andar de mão dada com a avaliação da necessidade de divulgar melhor a informação acerca dos produtos a nível de instrumentos financeiros.
Essa parceria abre novas oportunidades ao estabelecimento de uma cooperação eficaz. Não devemos, portanto, perder a oportunidade de apoiar energicamente a Rússia nessa modernização - não apenas investindo na modernização da economia, mas também na sua sociedade.
Essa postura crítica comum decorre da nossa posição como países periféricos, pois, no fim de contas, seremos nós a pagar esta taxa bastante singular e que os Estados-Membros que gozam de uma localização geográfica no centro da União Europeia arrecadarão.
Essa prática oferece uma imagem muito negativa da nossa Instituição. Faço notar que o montante atribuído excede por vezes o valor efectivamente gasto.
Essa reflexão conjunta deve procurar traçar um rumo que conduza ao êxito de ambos os dossiês de que os consumidores possam beneficiar.
Essa resistência pode ser transmitida dos animais aos seres humanos e constituir, assim, um risco para a saúde ou dificultar o tratamento de algumas doenças. É, por conseguinte, importante acompanhar de perto a utilização dos antibióticos na pecuária e em animais de estimação. É a protecção dos consumidores e a segurança da produção de alimentos que estão em causa, que devem registar um nível igualmente elevado em todos os Estados-Membros da UE. Considero adequado o Parlamento Europeu, que é composto pelos representantes eleitos do povo, exigir a adopção de medidas por parte da Comissão. Só poderemos reagir rapidamente e de forma eficaz se conhecermos a realidade da situação. Apoiei, portanto, o relatório apresentado e espero que a Comissão apresente num futuro próximo uma proposta para a adopção de medidas que visem o acompanhamento da utilização de antibióticos no sector de pecuária.
Essa revisão deve basear-se na Política Europeia de Vizinhança, que é sensível às necessidades dos países mais pobres e já não apenas aos interesses da Europa.
Essa situação não só conduzirá à discriminação na Europa, como é também extremamente questionável do ponto de vista do impacto que terá sobre as populações.
Essa situação vai contra todas as posições recentemente aprovadas, devendo ser a excepção.
Essa solução requer a participação das Nações Unidas, dos Estados Unidos e da União Europeia, e necessita do seu apoio activo para se conseguir a transferência de 3 400 refugiados do Campo de Ashraf para os Estados Unidos, o Canadá, a Austrália, a Noruega, a Suíça e Estados-Membros da UE, ou para outros locais onde tenham família ou outras ligações. Esta é a única opção que permite evitar uma nova catástrofe humanitária e mereceu a concordância dos próprios refugiados de Ashraf.
Essa é a minha resposta aos comentários do senhor Comissário e do senhor Presidente da Comissão sobre o segundo pilar. Não podemos aceitar um corte orçamental.
Essa é a razão pela qual queremos proibir os seus descendentes e por que queremos uma rotulagem clara dos descendentes.
Essa é uma exigência fundamental do nosso compromisso.
Essa é, de facto, uma suposição inovadora, mas creio tratar-se de uma questão de carácter.
Essas alterações não serão aprovadas, mas a tentativa está lá. As instituições europeias não devem ser tímidas em momentos como este.
Essas empresas, nas quais se incluem as empresas italianas, teriam de aguardar pelo processo de tradução para conseguirem obter os documentos necessários, comprometendo a rapidez de acção, factor de importância capital na actividade empresarial.
Essas informações podem constituir um fundamento extremamente importante para as decisões em matéria de política ambiental.
Essas informações podem constituir um fundamento importante para as decisões em matéria de política ambiental. A reciclagem e a prevenção dos resíduos, as emissões para a atmosfera e as alterações climáticas, a par do consumo e da produção sustentáveis, seriam passíveis de uma melhor supervisão se se dispusesse de dados de qualidade que combinassem o ambiente com a economia.
Essas informações serão extremamente valiosas para a tomada de decisões em matéria de política ambiental.
Essas negociações irão permitir a pesca nas águas da Mauritânia por navios que arvoram pavilhão da UE com base no princípio das existências excedentárias, conforme estabelecido na Convenção das Nações Unidas sobre o Direito do Mar. É igualmente necessário que a Mauritânia ratifique os instrumentos internacionais de pesca pertinentes.
Essas obrigações europeias poderão ser emitidas pelo FEEF, pelo MEE ou por uma nova agência europeia a criar futuramente.
Essas pessoas já correm riscos ao arrancar com as suas empresas, e depressa têm de fazer face aos desafios do negócio, à crise económica, às incertezas quanto ao futuro.
Essas são fantásticas notícias, pois significa que o Governo holandês pode exercer o seu direito de só aprovar o orçamento se não houver quaisquer aumentos, como defende o governo.
Esse acordo traduzir-se-ia em avultadas perdas de postos de trabalho a nível das explorações agrícolas e a nível industrial em zonas rurais da Irlanda e da UE no seu todo.
Esse apoio tem por objectivo facilitar a sua reintegração no mercado de trabalho. A votação de hoje diz respeito a um pedido de assistência relativamente a situações que abrangem 2 834 casos de despedimento (todos potenciais beneficiários de assistência) na empresa General Motors Belgium e em quatro dos seus fornecedores que operam no sector automóvel na região de Antuérpia de nível NUTS II, durante o período de referência de quatro meses de 14 de Junho a 14 de Outubro de 2010, num montante total de 9 593 931 euros, financiado pelo FEG.
Esse candidato - que é uma mulher, aliás - possui as qualidades requeridas.
Esse conhecimento foi frequentemente insatisfatório do ponto de vista dos cidadãos. Dentro de seis a nove meses, disporemos de muito mais dados, factos e resultados do que os que foram tornados públicos nos últimos 20 anos.
Esse departamento deve ser mobilizado, por se tratar de uma estrutura credível e que já deu boas provas, como por exemplo no caso da crise da Líbia.
Esse documento jurídico define as regras relativas à selecção das cidades, e os senhores deputados sabem melhor do que eu que uma decisão desta natureza só pode ser alterada através de uma nova iniciativa que seguirá o processo legislativo ordinário. A decisão dispõe que só têm acesso à acção em apreço os 27 Estados-Membros da União Europeia. A decisão inclui uma lista cronológica para cada ano até 2019 com os dois Estados-Membros que têm direito à nomeação. Já foram seleccionadas duas cidades para 2014, e o Conselho está prestes a confirmar as duas cidades para o ano de 2015.
Esse facto é bastante injustificável, pois para um Estado do antigo bloco comunista, a Mongólia aproveitou desde muito cedo a sua independência, enveredando por uma via de democratização da sua sociedade. A Mongólia adoptou uma constituição democrática ainda em 1992 e, desde então, realizaram-se várias eleições que, segundo os observadores, decorreram, em geral, de forma democrática e correcta - o que não pode ser, de modo algum, tomado como certo nos Estados dessa região.
Esse foi seguramente o lema do meu grupo nestas negociações. Duvido que os mercados e os nossos cidadãos acreditassem em soluções céleres mas superficiais.
Esse foi um grande passo, um passo difícil, que enfrentou uma imensa resistência.
Esse lugar é no meio desta Assembleia, atrás do pódio, porque a Senhora representa o Conselho, a Comissão e o Parlamento também. Creio que este diálogo precisa de ser desenvolvido e fortalecido para que a nossa política externa, dirigida e controlada pelos cidadãos da Europa, tenha legitimidade democrática.
Esse nível de desempenho tem de ser definido. O aspecto mais importante no que respeita a esses dados é a sua quantidade. O segundo aspecto mais importante é o do tempo que eles levam a ser transmitidos, a força com que são transmitidos, de forma a permitir a sua coexistência, e, por fim, as prioridades estabelecidas através do software.
Esse o motivo por que as declarações efectuadas pelo Primeiro-Ministro Netanyahu de que em Ramallah as autoridades deviam optar entre Israel e o Hamas não beneficiam nem a paz, nem o encontro de uma solução, nem a realização do projecto segundo o qual os dois Estados iriam viver lado a lado, num espírito de mútuo respeito.
Esse ponto não faz parte da ordem do dia.
Esse reforço deve estar ligado ao reforço da legitimidade democrática das decisões tomadas, ou seja, com o envolvimento mais próximo e atempado das partes interessadas, bem como dos parlamentos nacionais e do Parlamento Europeu. O presente relatório, que apoiei, defende que o plano de medidas correctivas deve estabelecer um conjunto de medidas políticas específicas que o Estado-Membro em causa implementou ou visa implementar devendo incluir o respectivo calendário.
Esse regulamento abordava as questões mais prementes e submeteu as agências de notação de rating à supervisão e regulação. Contudo, não resolveu todos os problemas.
Esse tipo de propostas foi apresentado durante muitos anos relativamente à fronteira entre a Polónia e a Alemanha, em prejuízo dos cidadãos polacos.
Esse é o desafio que aqui deixo e que aqui colocamos à Comissão Europeia, Senhor Comissário.
Esse é o objectivo da complementaridade orçamental que queremos alcançar através desta conferência, semelhante a uma convenção, que foi o objecto de uma proposta que fizemos ao Conselho durante o processo de conciliação e reiterámos neste relatório.
Esse é o objectivo do chamado "pacote de governação económica", de que faz parte este relatório do meu colega Carl Haglund. O relatório é relativo às medidas de execução para corrigir os desequilíbrios macroeconómicos excessivos na área do euro.
Esse é um caminho perigoso que poderia conduzir a graves desequilíbrios e a consequentes injustiças no tratamento dos países mais pobres.
Essencialmente, precisamos de mais Europa, não de menos Europa, e a Comissão deve afirmá-lo com maior veemência. O melhor da Europa foi mostrado no domingo à noite, quando, numa extraordinária cadeia de solidariedade humana, a população de Lampedusa salvou 500 náufragos cujo destino era, seguramente, a morte. O pior da Europa, se se confirmarem as notícias do jornal The Guardian, seria a não intervenção das forças militares da NATO para salvar homens, mulheres e crianças numa embarcação à deriva.
Esses comentários são os seguintes. A segurança alimentar a nível da UE e mundial e a globalização tornam imperativa uma nova política agrícola comum forte que, em primeiro lugar, melhore a nossa competitividade no mercado internacional, em segundo lugar, assegure um rendimento adequado aos agricultores, em terceiro lugar, assegure que os consumidores possam adquirir produtos de qualidade a preços justos, em quarto lugar, assegure o desenvolvimento sustentável das zonas rurais e, em quinto lugar, ajude a melhorar o estado do ambiente.
Esses critérios resumem-se a cinco. A Bulgária e a Roménia cumprem os seguintes: cumprem os requisitos em matéria de protecção de dados, cumprem o Sistema de Informação de Schengen (SIS), cumprem a cooperação policial, cumprem a emissão de vistos e cumprem o controlo das fronteiras externas aéreas, marítimas e terrestres.
Esses dados podem ser recolhidos no quadro das contas do ambiente, para cujo efeito é, no entanto, necessária a participação de cada Estado-Membro e uma plena harmonização ao nível da UE.
Esses domínios incluem a investigação e a promoção da inovação, o combate ao desemprego, à pobreza e à exclusão, a preparação adequada para as alterações demográficas, a utilização responsável dos recursos naturais, a segurança interna e externa, a política regional e agrícola, e o desenvolvimento de infra-estruturas de energia e de transporte.
Esses factores debilitam a confiança necessária à cooperação judiciária. O prazo de detenção antes do julgamento e durante a tramitação do processo varia significativamente de um Estado-Membro para outro.
Esses indivíduos também tomam decisões sobre os destinos das pessoas deste continente. E há outra questão: alguma vez se discutiu o facto de, imediatamente antes de uma reunião do Ecofin, em vésperas de um Conselho Europeu, haver sempre uma, duas ou três agências de notação de crédito que consideram desadequada a solução que está sobre a mesa para determinado problema? Quem são de facto as pessoas que exercem o poder sobre o desenvolvimento económico na Europa? Quem está por trás delas?
Esses interesses mútuos devem ser tratados de forma positiva e construtiva e, no que toca à política externa, isso significa também, como é natural, que a Rússia deve assumir alguma responsabilidade.
Esses programas permitem às pessoas adquirir as qualidades próprias de uma mão-de-obra móvel.
Esses testes de resistência devem estabelecer uma situação em que não seja possível proporcionar dados que subsequentemente não possam ser verificados. É esse o motivo por que queria exortá-lo a não se permitir ser manipulado por membros do Conselho de Ministros, mas antes a estabelecer critérios claros, comuns e verificáveis, de molde a que estes testes de resistência concretizem o seu objectivo.
Esses trabalhadores não têm frequentemente contratos correctos nem benefícios sociais.
Esta Assembleia está prestes a aprovar a quitação relativa a 27 agências da UE - numa altura em que o Tribunal de Contas Europeu lançou uma investigação de larga escala às suas contas para 2009.
Esta Constituição foi adoptada por um único partido, sem consultas públicas ou profissionais, e a legitimidade democrática dos seus autores é duvidosa.
Esta Eurovinheta constitui apenas um pequeno passo em frente com vista a esse objectivo.
Esta abordagem abrangente, que engloba todas as relações bilaterais, políticas e económicas de uma forma equilibrada, é necessária para satisfazer os nossos objectivos e as nossas ambições de uma parceria estratégica mais aprofundada.
Esta abordagem híbrida sui generis da política externa da UE dá força àqueles de nós que se opõem, em primeiro lugar, à criação do SEAE, considerando que as ambições globais da UE enfraquecem a soberania nacional.
Esta abordagem não pode nem deve restringir-se à UE, devendo, sempre que possível, ser também adoptada em acções externas, em particular durante a negociação de acordos. O respeito das normas da Organização Internacional do Trabalho, os princípios enunciados na Carta Social Europeia e o diálogo social são apenas alguns dos domínios que podem ser discutidos nestas ocasiões. Considero que o relatório que aprovámos apoia fortemente estes objectivos.
Esta abordagem permitirá compatibilizar o objectivo de redução de emissões de gases com efeito de estufa, estipulado para um país, com o tratamento holístico e global de cada um dos sectores industriais, evitando a fuga de carbono.
Esta abordagem é preferível à continuação do debate sobre a introdução de limites máximos para as ajudas sem que seja encontrada uma solução. Digo-o esta tarde porque é a minha opinião sincera.
Esta ajuda está de facto condicionada ao cumprimento de certos critérios que o Senhor Presidente muito bem conhece: eleições livres e regulares, liberdade de associação, liberdade de imprensa, liberdade de expressão, luta contra a corrupção, independência da justiça, reforma do exército e reforma da polícia.
Esta alteração aproximar-nos-ia da concretização dos objectivos ambiciosos consagrados no Tratado, e um aumento de 5% na despesa implicaria, de facto, um aumento muito reduzido, já que a inflação se situa actualmente nos 3,2%. Além disso, este aumento insignificante do orçamento da UE irá beneficiar as regiões mais pobres, que são quem mais beneficia da assistência da UE destinada a assegurar que as diferenças no desenvolvimento sejam ultrapassadas.
Esta alteração em curso numa das instituições de cúpula do sistema é indissociável da disputa entre diferentes fracções do grande capital em que emergem contradições entre as grandes potências. É inseparável, também, da questão não resolvida da reforma do sistema monetário e, com ela, da guerra monetária em torno da disputa da hegemonia do dólar no plano mundial.
Esta alteração introduz uma exigência de indicar a presença de partes não têxteis de origem animal em produtos têxteis. Há que salientar que as peles são com frequência utilizadas como adorno em roupa relativamente barata, muitas vezes importada da Ásia.
Esta análise - especialmente no tocante à redução dos custos e encargos administrativos e burocráticos - está em linha com a forma actual deste instrumento. A proposta de harmonização dos sistemas de tributação não pode conduzir a mais uma redução dos impostos sobre as empresas - presumivelmente pequenas empresas - enquanto os salários são afectados pelos planos de austeridade. É certo que a análise tem como objectivo melhorar o acesso das PME ao financiamento, mas não faz qualquer referência a assuntos sociais e ambientais e não menciona sequer o plano da Comissão Europeia para a apresentação de uma iniciativa em favor do empreendedorismo social anunciada para o fim do corrente ano. É verdade que, ao apresentar esta proposta, a Análise do "Small Business Act” manifesta uma pequena abertura a favor da economia social, mas contém fragilidades no que respeita aos desafios associados a estas outras formas de empreendedorismo. À semelhança do que aconteceu com a Directiva "Serviços de Comunicação Social Audiovisual", a Análise do "Small Business Act” não leva em linha de conta as lições contidas no relatório Monti para a recuperação da confiança dos cidadãos na União Europeia.
Esta análise incluirá todos os aspectos comerciais da utilização, como as estruturas jurídicas, contratuais e financeiras dos diferentes modelos de utilização, que assegurem o estabelecimento de um modelo de administração estável.
Esta assembleia tem raízes na tradição da comunidade polaco-lituana, que há mais de dois séculos representa a fronteira da Europa, enquanto projecto político, cultural e civil.
Esta atitude colide directamente com a Lei Fundamental da República Federal da Alemanha, segundo a qual "os cuidados prestados às crianças e a sua educação constituem um direito natural dos pais e um dever que é, em primeiro lugar, da sua responsabilidade” (artigo 6.º, n.º 2). Este relatório é uma manifestação da agenda anti-família da UE e procura interferir nas competências sociais dos Estados-Membros.
Esta atitude positiva deve ser verificada na prática, sobretudo em relação às 27 barreiras não tarifárias identificadas pela União Europeia, cuja eliminação é indispensável para podermos abrir as negociações com o Japão e transformá-las numa das prioridades da nossa política comercial.
Esta avaliação de impacto é importante para nós, não só para garantir que estamos a transmitir regulamentação que é necessária e eficaz, mas também para parar de responsabilizar uma entidade chamada Bruxelas por tudo o que corre mal.
Esta cidade pretende demonstrar o seu enorme potencial e promover-se junto dos europeus. Não há dúvida de que merece esta oportunidade, e devemos apoiá-la.
Esta classificação determina também se os resíduos serão eliminados em camadas geológicas profundas ou próximas da superfície. A responsabilidade final pelo combustível irradiado e os resíduos radioactivos cabe aos EstadosMembros.
Esta competição aparente levou o país à apatia política e desvalorizou o papel da Duma. O Presidente Medvedev poderia intervir de forma decisiva quanto a esta matéria e terminar a sua Presidência com pelo menos um sucesso comprovado.
Esta comunicação foi um contributo para a mais recente revisão do processo de Copenhaga, sendo agora o Comunicado de Bruges, obviamente, a agenda europeia por excelência em matéria de formação profissional para os anos de 2011-2020.
Esta crise exige uma acção decisiva da Europa.
Esta crítica é feita por pessoas cuja prioridade é a sua política externa nacional e os seus próprios interesses nacionais e que, sem consultarem qualquer dos seus parceiros, tomam decisões unilaterais, que acabam por dividir a Europa em vez de a unir.
Esta decisão significará que zonas relativamente ricas de Estados-Membros mais pobres (como Mazóvia e Varsóvia) continuarão a receber apoio.
Esta decisão vai contribuir para uma transição mais harmoniosa para o euro, dando resposta adequada à necessidade acrescida de transporte transfronteiriço de notas e moedas durante o período que antecede a mudança de moeda em circulação.
Esta destruição ambiental tem também impacto nas populações indígenas, as Primeiras Nações cujo ambiente está a ser destruído. Quem conhecer um pouco do Canadá, tenha visitado a Colúmbia Britânica e saiba como as grandes empresas internacionais têm usado a sua influência para levarem as populações indígenas a desistirem das suas terras ancestrais e permitirem a sua compra, não o pode simplesmente ignorar.
Esta desvalorização de 50% da moeda islandesa provocou uma subida em flecha da taxa de inflação na Islândia, que passou de 5% para 14%. A única forma de restabelecer a calma nos mercados é permitir que a Grécia, a Irlanda, Portugal e outros países reestruturem a sua dívida através da emissão de obrigações europeias (Eurobonds) a taxas razoáveis e garantidas pela União. Estou a referir-me à iniciativa Tremonti-Juncker.
Esta diferenciação por taxas mais elevadas de utilização das infra-estruturas proporciona-nos uma alternativa para combater o congestionamento de tráfego, e ainda que só incluamos a poluição atmosférica e sonora no cálculo dos custos externos, o mecanismo de diferenciação introduzido na Directiva pode ainda dar um contributo eficaz para a redução do congestionamento de tráfego típico das estradas europeias.
Esta directiva contribuirá para o fim da exploração de residentes ilegais de países terceiros por parte de alguns empregadores que lhes pagam salários desadequados e lhes impõem condições de trabalho insatisfatórias.
Esta directiva de 1999, revista em 2006, visa harmonizar a imposição de obrigações aos veículos pesados de mercadorias. A revisão adoptada constitui um primeiro passo na internalização dos custos externos no transporte rodoviário e, por conseguinte, um passo para levar à prática o princípio do "poluidor-pagador". A poluição atmosférica e sonora originada pelo tráfego será assim taxada, por via electrónica, à razão de três a quatro cêntimos por quilómetro, em função da classe Euro do veículo, do tipo de estrada e do nível de congestionamento.
Esta directiva faz parte do pacote legislativo sobre a chamada governação económica, constituído por seis diplomas legislativos e que é um verdadeiro atentado aos direitos sociais e laborais, integrando-se também na cruzada da União Europeia (UE) contra a independência e soberania nacionais.
Esta directiva não impedirá os comerciantes de oferecerem aos consumidores disposições contratuais que vão para além da protecção prevista na mesma.
Esta directiva visa simplificar e completar o quadro normativo vigente, fundindo num único instrumento legislativo as quatro directivas existentes, que prevêem apenas cláusulas de harmonização mínimas e deixam à discrição dos Estados-Membros a adopção de regras mais rigorosas, o que contribuiu para a existência de uma enorme fragmentação a nível comunitário e a elevados custos de conformidade para as empresas em transacções transfronteiras.
Esta directiva, sem resolver o problema da poluição, agrava a desigualdade entre Estados-Membros, ao colocar um maior ónus sobre os países periféricos como Portugal, que são exportadores, mas não são países de atravessamento.
Esta discussão ainda está em curso. Não quero com isso dizer que todas as perguntas foram respondidas e foi, precisamente, por esse motivo que tomei a iniciativa de organizar uma conferência sobre salários e fixação de salários na União Europeia.
Esta disposição é muito útil, em particular para os consumidores alérgicos a artigos de couro e para os consumidores que, por razões ideológicas, não querem comprar têxteis que contenham elementos de origem animal.
Esta distribuição de tarefas possibilitaria ainda o reforço da cooperação com o mais importante parceiro comercial e militar da UE, os Estados Unidos.
Esta estratégia adoptará uma abordagem holística e incluirá propostas concretas para mais medidas destinadas a resolver o problema da RAM no que respeita à saúde pública e animal.
Esta exigência - que subverte o espírito da organização, uma organização de Estados e não de organizações supranacionais - não é feita com o objectivo de tornar mais democrático o funcionamento da ONU ou para criar uma nova ordem mundial mais justa e pacífica.
Esta extraordinária equipa, liderada por Monika Strasser, não só foi competente e profissional, como também se revelou invulgarmente interessada no seu trabalho.
Esta foi a lógica subjacente ao meu voto a favor do relatório.
Esta foi uma questão muito debatida. A solução que apresentámos, sob a forma de uma série de declarações das três Instituições, parece suficiente para evitar um precedente.
Esta formação de carácter multicultural e plurigeográfico proporcionará uma formação mais completa e mais rica, contribuindo para a construção de um efectivo sentimento de pertença europeu que ajudará a cimentar o conceito de Cidadania Europeia constante dos Tratados.
Esta frase assume todo o seu sentido neste período pós-recessão mundial durante o qual assistimos uma retoma económica mais rápida nos Estados Unidos e a um crescimento ousado nas potências emergentes do grupo BRIC.
Esta grande abertura a possíveis modificações leva-me a expressar-me negativamente quanto às alterações que pretendem limitar tais deliberações futuras.
Esta heterogeneidade é também confirmada pela conclusão de que 75% dos 21 milhões de euros globais atribuídos a apoio financeiro foram totalmente disponibilizados através dos bancos intermediários, tendo sido mobilizados por apenas 50 000 do total de 23 milhões de pequenas e médias empresas.
Esta hipocrisia está igualmente patente no facto de quem protesta hoje de forma tão veemente contra a Hungria e o seu Primeiro-Ministro, Viktor Orbán, se ter mantido em silêncio quando o anterior Governo socialista da Hungria quase levou o país à bancarrota, recorrendo à força para silenciar a oposição quando protestou em manifestações e reuniões democráticas.
Esta inclui actividades e iniciativas da UE destinadas a promover normas laborais e sociais em países terceiros.
Esta iniciativa advoga a necessidade de melhorar o acesso ao mercado de trabalho por parte dos mais jovens - objectivo actualmente bastante pertinente, dado o valor atingido pelo desemprego juvenil em diversos Estados-Membros.
Esta iniciativa permite que os jovens adquiram conhecimento, aptidões e competências essenciais para o trabalho e a vida.
Esta iniciativa é composta por 28 acções-chave e medidas concretas que visam fomentar a educação e formação dos jovens, através da mobilidade e empregabilidade, indo ao encontro dos objectivos da Estratégia UE 2020 de reduzir o abandono escolar para menos de 10 %, aumentar o nível de educação terciária de 31 para 40 % até 2020 e reduzir o desemprego, sobretudo o jovem, que actualmente se cifra em cerca de 21 %. Por isso, e como proponente da acção preparatória para a juventude O teu primeiro emprego EURES, não podia estar mais de acordo com as propostas plasmadas no relatório e votei-o favoravelmente, consciente de que a UE deve continuar, e reforçar, todas as medidas de apoio aos nossos jovens. Só assim conseguiremos uma Europa mais forte, solidária e inclusiva.
Esta inovação aparenta abertura e uma maior flexibilidade financeira, mas, num período de austeridade e de restrições orçamentais como aquele em que nos encontramos, conduzirá inevitavelmente a cortes no financiamento de outras regiões, em particular das regiões do Objectivo 1 (convergência), que incluem as regiões do sul de Itália.
Esta ligação permitirá a todos os países da União o acesso online a dados sobre cidadãos clandestinos que tentam chegar à Europa e garante um controlo mais eficaz nas fronteiras externas da União Europeia.
Esta linha de actuação é contrária à regulamentação da UE em matéria de livre circulação de bens e serviços. Ela resultará também num aumento da xenofobia e no aumento da influência dos partidos que proclamam slogans populistas e nacionalistas.
Esta manhã, estamos a reflectir sobre os desafios que a cultura enfrenta no mundo globalizado do século XXI. A Comissão Europeia, com a publicação do seu Livro Verde no ano passado, reconheceu finalmente o potencial das nossas indústrias criativas e culturais. A União Europeia possui património cultural e bens culturais, bem como uma indústria cinematográfica extremamente dinâmica e viva. O programa MEDIA celebra 20 anos no Festival de Cannes e apoiou 20 dos filmes que estarão a concurso, bem como festivais, as artes do espectáculo e grandes exposições, que decorrem ao longo de todo o ano e em toda a Europa.
Esta matéria é, pois, da exclusiva competência do direito nacional, no devido respeito pelas obrigações internacionais da Grécia, incluindo as convenções da Organização Internacional do Trabalho de que é signatária.
Esta medida importante irá criar melhores oportunidades para as comunidades empresariais das duas partes e liberalizará ainda mais as relações comerciais e económicas a nível global. A aplicação de medidas proteccionistas é, portanto, contraproducente e fazemos votos de que não se escondam por detrás de ameaças de saúde exageradas, que foi o que, a nosso ver, aconteceu recentemente com a proibição de todas as importações de produtos hortícolas da UE.
Esta medida permitirá alterar a actual situação, absurda e injusta, em que o montante da ajuda pode variar até um coeficiente de seis, colocando os agricultores de vários Estados-Membros em condições desiguais e distorcendo a competitividade entre os agricultores europeus.
Esta medida poderá representar também uma nova fonte de financiamento de formas de transporte mais limpas como o caminho-de-ferro e as vias navegáveis.
Esta medida é igualmente muito importante a par do Livro Branco da Comissão, recentemente publicado, " Roteiro do espaço único europeu dos transportes - Rumo a um sistema de transportes competitivo e económico em recursos".
Esta medida é sem dúvida necessária para pôr termo às negociações vergonhosas e pouco transparentes dos membros do Conselho nos bastidores.
Esta medida, que aplica o princípio do "poluidor-pagador", visa incentivar a renovação progressiva das frotas de veículos pesados de mercadorias que circulam nas nossas estradas.
Esta meta deve ser cumprida, como o nome sugere, desenvolvendo a ideia do intercâmbio de jovens e ajudando-os a adquirir novas competências.
Esta mudança de paradigma será, na minha opinião, fundamental para estancar o crescimento do desemprego entre os mais jovens, e para lhes garantir um futuro com mais possibilidades.
Esta nomeação também será confirmada pela reunião do Conselho dos Chefes de Estado e de Governo, mas já é algo muito prestigioso para a Itália, não só por causa do perfil profissional extremamente elevado, da competência e da experiência do senhor Draghi em assuntos económicos europeus, mas também porque a sua investidura para os próximos oito anos recebeu o pleno apoio de todos os líderes europeus.
Esta nova abordagem será igualmente relevante para as regiões de montanha que também podem desempenhar um papel de vanguarda na consecução dos objectivos da estratégia Europa 2020.
Esta nova directiva, que compreende a fusão de quatro directivas já existentes, pretende dar um novo impulso para a plena prossecução do mercado interno, eliminando os obstáculos jurídicos ao comércio transfronteiriço. Após longas negociações entre as várias instituições, este novo quadro jurídico irá garantir condições comuns e claras para os cidadãos e as empresas do espaço europeu.
Esta nova legislação europeia elimina alegadamente obstáculos ao comércio transfronteiriço, criados pelas diferenças nos regimes jurídicos nacionais. A questão é que nada no relatório da senhora deputada Wallis prova a existência objectiva desses obstáculos, nem, por conseguinte, de um problema que carece de solução. Logo, nada, à excepção da vontade de dar início a um novo método de imposição de legislação supranacional, justifica essa posição. Além disso, seria criado o risco de utilização desse regime para proteger disposições nacionais, sobretudo em matéria de direitos do consumidor.
Esta nova proposta de Acordo sobre a Directiva europeia relativa aos direitos dos consumidores culmina duras negociações entre o Parlamento Europeu, o Conselho e a Comissão. É um compromisso sobre as normas destinadas a proteger melhor os consumidores e a garantir condições comuns claras para as empresas concorrentes no mercado único.
Esta não será certamente uma tarefa fácil, dada a natureza delicada da matéria e o impacto potencial das decisões tomadas neste contexto. O desafio que nos preparamos para abraçar reside, pois, em encontrar indicadores fiáveis que sejam teoricamente coerentes, politicamente pertinentes e empiricamente mensuráveis.
Esta não é a primeira vez que o Parlamento Europeu debate a questão dos directórios de empresas enganosos e o problema das "empresas de repertórios" tem sido abordado com frequência com a Comissão e os Estados-Membros.
Esta não é auto-suficiente e enfrenta a influência das economias chinesa, indiana e brasileira, que se estão a desenvolver a um ritmo elevadíssimo. O apoio financeiro e a simplificação dos procedimentos legislativos relacionados com o desenvolvimento científico devem constituir uma prioridade para a UE. Ficar parado é andar para trás.
Esta não é uma declaração abstracta. A política de coesão e a política agrícola comum têm impacto no quotidiano de milhões de cidadãos. Não pode haver dúvidas de que algumas das tarefas executadas pela UE não seriam levadas a cabo por qualquer outro organismo.
Esta operação destina-se à prevenção e detecção de passagens ilegais das fronteiras para Lampedusa, Sicília, Sardenha e território continental italiano. A Frontex está igualmente a fornecer apoio às autoridades italianas em actividades de controlo de fronteiras de segunda linha, dando instruções aos migrantes e fazendo a respectiva triagem.
Esta opinião é dominante em todos os grupos do Parlamento Europeu, como atesta o facto de não terem sido apresentadas alterações ao relatório.
Esta parceria é extremamente importante para os nossos parceiros árabes, que procuram o apoio da União Europeia para as transições democráticas no Mediterrâneo meridional. Não devemos desiludi-los.
Esta pergunta, Senhora Alta Representante, é ainda mais premente depois de, na semana passada, a Fatah e o Hamas terem restabelecido a unidade palestiniana ignorando por completo as condições das Partes - isto é, incluindo a União Europeia - para um Governo Palestiniano unificado, nomeadamente, o reconhecimento do Estado de Israel, a renúncia à violência e ao terrorismo e o cumprimento dos compromissos assumidos anteriormente.
Esta perspectiva - a que alguns também chamam "economia social de mercado” - é, na verdade, um novo paradigma que vai além da economia do bem-estar e repõe a centralidade do ser humano.
Esta política de austeridade radical está a conduzir novamente os cidadãos da Grécia, Portugal e Espanha, mas também os dos países do norte da Europa, a um nacionalismo imprudente que julgávamos ter vencido há muito tempo na Europa.
Esta política é porventura mais importante na Tunísia do que em qualquer outro sítio. O discurso do Primeiro-Ministro Essebsi na televisão pode ajudar na perspectiva das eleições de 24 de Julho, mas ele reconheceu os problemas de um país onde as taxas de crescimento económico se situam entre 0 e 1%. Temos de assegurar o apoio à Tunísia, à sua economia e à sua sociedade civil, e isso significa pensar não só a longo prazo, não só na importância de uma nova estratégia, mas na nossa acção presente e como prestamos apoio aos países - Egipto, Tunísia e outros - neste momento em que estamos confrontados com os problemas orçamentais. É por esta razão que iniciámos um debate com as instituições financeiras, com os Estados-Membros da UE, com aqueles que pretendem prestar apoio a estes países, porque ajudá-los a fazer frente aos défices quando o turismo ruiu, quando a economia não funciona adequadamente, é muito importante.
Esta profunda crise dos orçamentos nacionais está a ser acompanhada por uma orgia de cortes, que está a gerar situações dramáticas em vários Estados-Membros da União Europeia, em parte por via da adopção de medidas impostas pela União Europeia. Há o risco de, na sequência da crise bancária, da crise económica e da crise orçamental nacional, 2011 e 2012 virem a ser os anos da crise social na Europa.
Esta proposta altera certos elementos do Regulamento n.º 1215/2009 (CE), a fim de permitir a prorrogação da sua validade até 31 de Dezembro de 2015 e de fazer alguns ajustes decorrentes da entrada em vigor dos acordos bilaterais com a Bósnia-Herzegovina e a Sérvia.
Esta proposta de regulamento aqui analisada apenas prevê a recolha e a compilação de dados no âmbito das emissões para a atmosfera, dos impostos ambientais por actividade económica e das contas de fluxos de materiais para a economia.
Esta proposta de resolução do Parlamento Europeu sobre "Investir no futuro: um novo Quadro Financeiro Plurianual (QFP) para uma Europa competitiva, sustentável e inclusiva" é importante, simultaneamente, para a concretização dos objectivos UE 2020 (no que respeita à restauração e à protecção a longo prazo dos níveis de crescimento económico) e para prevenir a reincidência da actual crise conómica.
Esta proposta de resolução do Parlamento Europeu sobre o Relatório 2010 sobre a implementação dos programas da política de coesão para 2007-2013 inclui pontos que são contrários aos princípios do nosso posicionamento político, pelo que não pode ser apoiada.
Esta proposta de resolução do Parlamento Europeu é importante pois os GNSS (Sistemas Globais de Navegação por Satélite) podem ser aplicados a todos os meios de transporte (terrestres, marítimos e aéreos), permitindo que o tráfego funcione de forma mais eficiente, apoiando o crescimento económico e reduzindo a poluição. Ao mesmo tempo, o GNSS faz parte dos principais objectivos de inovação da estratégia Europa 2020.
Esta proposta de resolução sugere, entre outras coisas, a atribuição de financiamento para a investigação e para o desenvolvimento das novas aplicações do GNSS susceptíveis de serem aplicadas em áreas como a alteração climática, a agricultura, a protecção civil, sistemas de alerta de catástrofes naturais e assim por diante.
Esta proposta refere-se à aceleração e clarificação da aplicação do procedimento relativo aos défices excessivos.
Esta proposta refere-se à celebração de um novo protocolo ao Acordo de Parceria entre a UE e São Tomé e Príncipe. O objectivo principal aqui é definir as oportunidades de pesca disponíveis para a frota da UE com base no excedente existente, bem como determinar o valor da contribuição financeira a prestar, separadamente, para direitos de acesso e para apoiar o sector.
Esta proposta vem dar resposta às dúvidas subjacentes, seguindo os princípios da igualdade e da cooperação, relativamente à competência de uma comissão no caso de um dossier legislativo se revestir de importância significativa.
Esta proposta, em linha com as medidas anteriores, propõe-se facilitar ainda mais a vida aos grandes importadores europeus - os seus principais beneficiários - que acedem a matérias-primas e produtos finais de baixo custo, com sacrifício das indústrias nacionais e de milhares de postos de trabalho.
Esta proposta, em linha com as medidas anteriores, propõe-se facilitar ainda mais a vida aos grandes importadores europeus - os seus principais beneficiários, que assim acedem a matérias-primas e produtos finais de baixo custo, com sacrifício das indústrias nacionais e de milhares de postos de trabalho.
Esta prática não originaria certamente segurança jurídica. É importante que os Artigos 5.º e 6.º sejam mantidos.
Esta questão foi já debatida em anos anteriores, nomeadamente em 2007, quando o Parlamento Europeu e a Comissão, juntamente com vários organismos e associações, organizaram uma conferência intitulada "Para Além do PIB". Nesta conferência, a Comissão defendeu que o PIB não é um sistema de medição a longo prazo adequado, tal como o progresso económico e o progresso social não são suficientes para aferir questões como as alterações climáticas, a eficiência dos recursos ou o bem-estar individual.
Esta questão interessa-me particularmente porque a verdadeira intenção do mandado de detenção europeu é frequentemente comprometida pela emissão sistemática de mandados de detenção, frequentemente por delitos menores.
Esta questão não diz respeito à Organização Mundial de Comércio: é uma questão de vontade política, e podemos demonstrar isso mesmo, e é isso que satisfará este Parlamento, e isso é a base para se chegar a acordo.
Esta questão tem implicações a nível da saúde humana, sobretudo dos trabalhadores que lidam com estes animais, mas também a nível económico, pois está em causa o futuro competitivo da pecuária comunitária. O PE já debateu este assunto por mais de uma vez, tendo adoptado algumas iniciativas, como a base de dados que deve ser permanentemente actualizada, mas chegou a hora de se passar das palavras aos actos para que os normativos em vigor deixem de ser letra morta. É, pois, essencial que a nova PAC tenha esta problemática em conta e estimule as boas práticas pecuárias.
Esta rede reforçada contribuirá igualmente para tornar a economia digital da Europa mais competitiva, na esperança de desenvolver um ambiente inovador e criativo, capaz de fomentar futuros progressos no domínio da tecnologia digital.
Esta redução substancial dos recursos não é, com efeito, uma opção válida para aqueles que acreditam numa Europa verdadeiramente competitiva, e os países que fazem este pedido deveriam especificar de forma clara quais os projectos prioritários que terão de ser abandonados para possibilitar estes cortes.
Esta região foi a chave do conflito e, segundo a declaração do Grupo de Crise Internacional, os desenvolvimentos nesta parte do país influenciarão o destino de todo o Sudão. O país permanecerá em paz ou mergulhará numa nova guerra?
Esta resolução apela à afectação ao orçamento europeu de recursos à altura das ambições da UE. Sou totalmente a favor desta ideia e dou-lhe o meu apoio.
Esta resolução destaca a necessidade de eliminar as barreiras não pautais do mercado japonês e de desregulamentar o acesso ao mercado japonês de contratos públicos, antes de se assinar um acordo de livre comércio com este país.
Esta resolução foi aprovada na sequência da proposta apresentada pela Comissão no sentido de dar início a negociações com vista à renovação do Acordo de Parceria no domínio da pesca entre a União Europeia e a Mauritânia.
Esta resolução sobre a Cimeira UE-Rússia prevê relações comercias mais ambiciosas, um novo Acordo de Parceria e Cooperação e a liberalização do regime de vistos, mas Moscovo tem de dar garantias da melhoria da situação dos direitos humanos no país, pondo fim a decisões judiciais com motivações políticas, à falta de liberdade de imprensa e à ocupação das províncias georgianas.
Esta revisão constitui igualmente um primeiro passo para o restabelecimento de uma concorrência leal entre os transportadores europeus, uma vez que alguns Estados-Membros, como França e a Alemanha, já aplicam o princípio do "poluidor-pagador" e pretendem vê-lo alargado a todos os outros.
Esta revisão permitirá doravante gerir melhor o tráfego graças ao aumento das receitas em períodos de pico (não excedendo 175% ao longo de um período cinco horas), mas prevê igualmente uma diminuição proporcional em períodos de menor afluência a fim de não penalizar financeiramente as empresas de transporte rodoviário.
Esta semana chegaram muitas pessoas da Líbia - nacionais de países terceiros, e até Líbios - e este fluxo poderá aumentar.
Esta semana estamos a celebrar o Dia da Europa, em que recordamos a Declaração Robert Schuman, que falava de uma Europa que "se fará por meio de realizações concretas que criem em primeiro lugar uma solidariedade de facto". Neste momento é essa solidariedade que está a faltar, em especial na expressão de uma vontade política forte e partilhada por todos os Estados-Membros, a qual não só dará maior protecção às nossas fronteiras, mas também tornará mais credível a nossa economia. O relatório Gualtieri sublinha claramente o facto de que as forças armadas europeias não são adequadas para construir um sistema de defesa europeu comum ou para alcançar os objectivos definidos no Tratado de Lisboa para a segurança interna e externa da União. Sem uma capacidade militar credível, a política comum de segurança e defesa europeia continuará a existir no papel e nas palavras dos que não possuem as ferramentas necessárias para a executar eficazmente.
Esta semana, li uma frase interessante num jornal alemão. Os mercados - escreve o jornal alemão - desconfiam da União Europeia porque já não acreditam que ela encontrará soluções para os problemas. O povo da Europa, os cidadãos, desconfiam da União Europeia porque já não acreditam que os governos encontrarão soluções para os seus problemas.
Esta semana, representantes do Fundo Internacional para a Irlanda e do Programa para a Paz e a Reconciliação vieram aqui ao Parlamento Europeu para debater com a Comissão do Desenvolvimento Regional a importância do apoio do Parlamento e da União ao programa. Não tenho dúvidas de que a União Europeia e os demais parceiros internacionais devem reflectir maduramente sobre a questão e decidir prosseguir com esse profícuo e eficaz programa.
Esta sensação é confirmada pelo n.º 27, que salienta que, na ausência de serviços adequados à primeira infância, as nossas crianças mais pequenas correm o risco de cair na criminalidade e no comportamento anti-social. A sua confiança no ser humano é espantosa, e eu pergunto-me como conseguiu a Humanidade viver sem a senhora deputada até agora. Não, na verdade, o melhor favor que pode fazer aos nossos mais pequenos é deixá-los em paz!
Esta sessão plenária teve o efeito de cancelar as poucas contribuições positivas do relator e dos grupos políticos àquilo que já era, desde o princípio, uma proposta fraca. A responsabilidade por esta situação não é do Parlamento, e sim da Comissão. Há algumas questões relativamente às quais até nós, os eurocépticos da Lega Nord, estamos a dizer sim a um elevado grau de harmonização, mas apenas quando a harmonização faz sentido e é compatível com o interesse público, com os interesses das pequenas e médias empresas e, porque não, com as prerrogativas dos Estados-Membros.
Esta situação confirma uma verdade, ou seja, que, em muitas situações, os verdadeiros "bons" somos nós, os "maus". Nós, que afirmamos que é preciso controlar a imigração e as fronteiras externas, continuamos a pedir à Europa - como acaba de o fazer, com toda a razão, o senhor deputado Cohn-Bendit - que reparta pelo seu território um número de refugiados que poderá ascender a 50 000 ou a 100 000, pois as pessoas que fogem da Líbia não são delinquentes.
Esta situação constitui agora um risco de segurança para toda a região. Também por este motivo, é importante a adopção da resolução neste momento. A União deve assumir uma abordagem mais activa e mais responsável, no Azerbaijão e em toda a região. Deveríamos aprender com a experiência do conflito entre a Rússia e a Geórgia e impedir a repetição de tragédias semelhantes.
Esta situação deve ser tida em conta, e temos de antecipar que a libertação de frequências apenas será possível quando países como a Rússia e a Bielorrússia também o fizerem.
Esta situação deveria soar como um sinal de alarme antes da votação. Reitero, com a máxima veemência possível, que aprovar a utilização de 523 milhões de euros de - não nos esqueçamos - dinheiro dos contribuintes raia a loucura, quando o órgão responsável pela auditoria oficial da UE investiga possíveis fraudes e a má gestão financeira das referidas agências. O adiamento relativo à Agência Europeia de Medicamentos e à Academia Europeia de Polícia (CEPOL) é o menos.
Esta situação foi referida em diversas ocasiões recentes. O relatório Monti de 9 de Maio de 2010 - "Uma nova estratégia para o mercado único" - salienta que, embora a livre circulação dos trabalhadores seja um sucesso do ponto de vista jurídico, é a menos utilizada das quatro liberdades do mercado único.
Esta situação não contribui de forma alguma para a confiança nos sistemas jurídicos europeus.
Esta situação pode comprometer as iniciativas políticas nacionais sobre legislação ambiental, social ou fiscal. O acordo de comércio livre deverá ser o mais importante de todos os acordos negociados até à data.
Esta situação pode, pois, ter custos económicos e sociais elevados, bem como um impacto negativo no crescimento sustentável da União e na sua capacidade para melhorar a sua competitividade global no futuro.
Esta situação salienta uma vez mais a necessidade de se instar à realização de um inquérito independente aos crimes de guerra e a que o regime de Rajapaksa seja responsabilizado.
Esta situação vai contra o objectivo da coesão territorial, segundo o qual o desenvolvimento dos Estados-Membros, numa perspectiva geográfica, deve processar-se de forma equilibrada, o que é precisamente um objectivo consagrado no Tratado de Lisboa.
Esta situação é extremamente preocupante, e estamos ansiosos por mostrar aos pescadores que estamos inequivocamente ao seu lado.
Esta situação, que faz com que não tenhamos influência sobre a segurança das centrais nucleares, não pode continuar.
Esta solidariedade pode revestir-se de várias formas, por exemplo, prestando apoio em fronteiras externas que estejam sob pressão. A Frontex tem aqui um papel fundamental, e mostrámos através da recente intervenção RABIT na fronteira greco-turca e da operação naval conjunta Hermes, que os Estados-Membros estão prontos a apoiar outros Estados-Membros.
Esta solução deve ser complementada por uma estratégia de longo prazo destinada a apoiar a economia europeia, de modo a assegurar que estará à altura do mercado globalizado em que vivemos.
Esta subida vertiginosa dos preços está também a trazer-nos profundos efeitos negativos: redução de saídas para o mar, rendimentos de miséria por parte dos pescadores, agravados pelos baixos preços pagos na primeira venda, aumentos das importações, de países terceiros, de produtos da aquicultura e da pesca para o mercado europeu e um consequente abandono da actividade, por dificuldades financeiras, com mais perda de postos de trabalho.
Esta sugestão e aviso constam do documento apresentado, do qual alguns pontos poderiam ser mais específicos nas suas críticas.
Esta transparência das instituições e clareza da actuação dos seus agentes deve ser um elemento intrínseco a uma efectiva e genuína democracia.
Esta violência indiscriminada provocou traumas psicológicos profundos às vítimas, resultando em medos de longa duração, emoções suprimidas, auto-censura e passividade.
Esta votação compromete-nos em relação a um maior reconhecimento do sector cultural e do seu potencial, que continua a ser elevado porque o sector sempre resistiu a todos os obstáculos jurídicos ou económicos.
Esta é a análise clara que podemos fazer hoje.
Esta é a burla do século! Senhor Comissário Olli Rehn, consegue garantir-me, agora mesmo, que esse cenário, em que a Grécia primeiro refinancia a sua dívida o mais que pode com o dinheiro dos contribuintes neerlandeses e depois abandona o euro e cancela as suas dívidas, é um cenário que não irá acontecer? Não podemos confiar nestes gregos, nos políticos gregos que, juntamente com a Comissão Europeia, abriram caminho para entrar no euro de forma enganosa e com dados incorrectos, e que agora parecem estar sobretudo interessados em aumentar os seus próprios ordenados.
Esta é a lei que vigora hoje na Europa: uma força policial nacional que diz às pessoas que têm uma autorização de residência emitida pela Itália: 'O Sr. Sarkozy decidiu que não valem'. Se este é o estado da lei na Europa, então eu digo que algo está a ir mal, e é por esse motivo que vos peço que parem de nos dizer que os problemas no Norte de África constituem um problema de segurança. O problema no Norte de África e o problema da guerra na Líbia estão a causar um problema de insegurança para as pessoas que vivem nesses países.
Esta é a mensagem que o Presidente da Comissão Barroso, falando em nome da Comissão Europeia, envia há meses aos Estados-Membros.
Esta é a terceira candidatura a ser examinada sob o orçamento de 2011 e diz respeito a EUR 9.593.931 do Fundo Europeu de Ajustamento à Globalização a favor da reintegração no mercado de trabalho de 2 834 trabalhadores da General Motors Bélgica e de quatro empresas suas fornecedoras de Antuérpia.
Esta é uma União de culturas diferentes e prioridades divergentes.
Esta é uma abordagem equilibrada, pois o parecer reconhece os progressos realizados por estes dois países no que respeita aos critérios que têm de ser cumpridos para a integração no espaço Schengen (controlo das fronteiras terrestres, marítimas e aéreas, vistos, cooperação policial, capacidade de ligar e utilizar o Sistema de Informação Schengen e protecção de dados), mas também exige relatórios regulares sobre a evolução de determinadas questões consideradas pendentes.
Esta é uma causa de natureza organizacional que permanece intocada neste relatório, e não há comités de avaliação de risco nem exigências de competências profissionais dos administradores que evitem as consequências danosas do uso das poupanças das famílias para obter lucros por via especulativa. O comportamento de manada nos mercados financeiros é um fenómeno incontornável que leva fatalmente à constituição de bolhas especulativas e ao seu rebentamento.
Esta é uma concessão prejudicial.
Esta é uma condição sem a qual são impossíveis quaisquer negociações com países terceiros. A política comercial não pode ignorar o desrespeito dos direitos dos trabalhadores, pelo que a sociedade apenas pode continuar a desenvolver-se se estes obstáculos forem eliminados.
Esta é uma condição sem a qual são impossíveis quaisquer negociações com países terceiros. A política comercial não pode ignorar o desrespeito dos direitos dos trabalhadores, pelo que a sociedade apenas pode continuar a desenvolver-se se estes obstáculos forem eliminados. É essencial que as normas laborais internacionais sejam utilizadas para garantir que o desenvolvimento económico continue a estar muito centrado na melhoria da vida e da dignidade humanas e não na determinação das condições e dos direitos dos trabalhadores.
Esta é uma condição sine qua non.
Esta é uma fase delicada do desenvolvimento cerebral, físico e cognitivo das crianças, bem como da sua expressão linguística. São os anos em que as crianças aprendem e assimilam os instrumentos que, enquanto adultos, utilizarão para elaborar mecanismos cognitivos que são diferentes, mas necessários para a sua educação e o seu trabalho no futuro.
Esta é uma importante fonte de medicamentos genéricos para os países em desenvolvimento, e não devemos ceder à pressão da indústria farmacêutica que visa pôr entraves ao fornecimento de medicamentos genéricos por parte do Canadá.
Esta é uma matéria particularmente sensível no meu país, embora todo o capítulo sobre agricultura seja importante para ambas as partes. É também de notar que estamos obrigados a reduzir as emissões de CO2.
Esta é uma nova proposta de Acordo sobre a Directiva europeia relativa aos direitos dos consumidores, que culmina duras negociações entre o Parlamento Europeu, o Conselho e a Comissão.
Esta é uma outra área na qual a Comissão tem de introduzir melhorias.
Esta é uma questão ainda mais sensível numa altura em que outros projectos europeus de importância fundamental estão em dúvida, se não mesmo em crise. O euro está sob pressão constante e o problema é, em parte, criado pela mesma falta de ambição e coerência europeias. O Espaço Schengen é reduzido diariamente e as barreiras nacionais reaparecem ao mesmo tempo que o espírito e a legislação europeus são ignorados ou violados por outros Estados-Membros.
Esta é uma questão de longa data que temos agora de acometer mais rapidamente, pois, da próxima vez, pode suceder que o agente patogénico tenha de ser tratado com antibióticos mas, por ser resistente a eles, não seja possível tratá-lo. Temos de trabalhar esta questão.
Esta é uma questão importante, que faz parte do acordo. Há que ter consciência de que ela teve um custo elevado para alguns de nós e que, para a levar a bom termo, necessitamos de uma unidade tão ampla quanto possível neste Parlamento em relação a todos os aspectos do acordo.
Esta é uma questão muito relevante para a Lituânia.
Esta é uma questão que temos de analisar atentamente, talvez alinhando o orçamento para provar aos cidadãos e aos Estados-Membros que o que estamos a fazer é agregar valor.
Esta é uma situação injusta, que prejudica os caminhos-de-ferro amigos do ambiente, aliviando simultaneamente as estradas que são prejudiciais ao ambiente.
Esta é uma tarefa crucial, mas o papel do FMI, para além da estabilização dos mercados, é também o de ajudar a corrigir os desequilíbrios mundiais que conduziram a esta crise.
Esta é, em grande medida, a visão do Grupo do Partido Popular Europeu (Democratas-Cristãos), se não for a de todas as delegações, atendendo a que apoiamos a internalização dos custos em todos os tipos de transporte e também apoiamos a utilização de recursos para promover a mobilidade.
Esta é, naturalmente, uma questão complexa, e teremos de ter em conta todas aquelas questões sensíveis que se prendem com uma simplificação, porém, o facto é que certas disposições do Regulamento estão realmente desactualizadas e precisam de ser repensadas e revistas.
Esta última representa um elemento fundamental de informação para o consumidor antes da aquisição de um produto.
Estabelece o nível máximo de emissões em função da potência do motor utilizado e organiza a redução progressiva das emissões em etapas sucessivas.
Estabelecemos medidas para as ajudar mas, infelizmente, nem sempre foram bem sucedidas. O Instrumento Europeu de Microfinanciamento "Progress" criado pela Comissão era, de facto, uma medida muito apropriada para proporcionar às pequenas empresas oportunidades de obterem financiamento durante a crise.
Estabeleceu, ou pretende estabelecer, contactos com os Estados-Membros e as autoridades israelitas para discutir o desenvolvimento desta iniciativa e, eventualmente, apresentar um contributo positivo da União Europeia que pudesse conduzir a um desfecho mais responsável?
Estabeleceu-se como objectivo a redução da taxa de abandono escolar precoce, para um nível inferior a 10 %, e permitir que 40 % dos jovens completem o ensino superior, até 2020. São metas bastante ambiciosas, mas necessárias para o crescimento económico e o aumento da competitividade dos Estados-Membros e, consequentemente, para a criação de postos de trabalho.
Estamos a absorver antibióticos através dos nossos alimentos, o que resulta num aumento de resistência.
Estamos a acompanhar os incidentes que envolvem detenções e pressão política sobre activistas democráticos, jornalistas e a oposição política. O Azerbaijão e outros países da região têm de perceber claramente que as violações de direitos humanos e cívicos não serão toleradas em circunstância alguma.
Estamos a aguardar que a Comissão apresente um Livro Branco que reflicta esta abordagem global e coloque a ênfase na necessidade de assegurar um futuro para as nossas florestas e a preparação de todos nós para investir nesse futuro.
Estamos a apoiar o processo, mas o referendo representa, definitivamente, um ponto de viragem: é uma situação completamente nova em termos qualitativos. Não é a mesma situação de antes.
Estamos a assistir à renacionalização da Europa.
Estamos a avançar no domínio da facilitação dos vistos. O Conselho de 28 de Fevereiro adoptou directrizes de negociação para a facilitação dos vistos e acordos de readmissão, e instamos os Estados-Membros a aproveitarem ao máximo as opções de flexibilidade criadas pelo Código de Vistos, nomeadamente a possibilidade de abolir ou de reduzir os emolumentos relativos a vistos para determinadas categorias de cidadãos. Na vertente da ajuda, a Comissão está a quadruplicar o seu apoio à população e à sociedade civil da Bielorrússia.
Estamos a debater em conjunto como devemos participar no futuro da Líbia - para apoiar o diálogo nacional, a Constituição e a preparação das eleições. Enviei duas missões à Líbia para se encontrarem e trabalharem com jovens e com mulheres naquele país. Como o chefe da minha equipa me disse, é a primeira vez que ali se debate uma Constituição - palavras e argumentos que eles ignoravam.
Estamos a desenvolver medidas destinadas a apoiar a transferência dos resultados da investigação e a sua transformação em produtos e serviços concretos e comercializáveis.
Estamos a entrar numa fase crucial das negociações do Acordo de Comércio Livre UE-Índia.
Estamos a executar um programa muito sistemático de consolidação orçamental em todos os Estados-Membros, que se mostram empenhados em realizar reformas estruturais corajosas com vista a estimular o crescimento e a criação de emprego.
Estamos a falar de alguém com um currículo inatacável e uma experiência internacional significativa em instituições públicas e privadas, alguém que já foi extremamente pro-activo (como, por exemplo, na sua presidência do Fórum de Estabilidade Financeira). As suas publicações testemunham um perfil académico sem dúvida à altura das tarefas que terá de cumprir e a sua experiência no campo monetário tem de dissipar qualquer dúvidas no que diz respeito às suas capacidades. Não é coincidência que o consenso no que diz respeito à sua nomeação tenha sido quase unânime.
Estamos a falar de ter uma mão-de-obra formada, algo de que nós precisamos e sabemos disso.
Estamos a gastar o nosso dinheiro da forma mais judiciosa possível? Não há demasiado dinheiro a ser gasto com a administração? Não há demasiado dinheiro a ser gasto com formalidades e burocracias? Estamos a canalizar dinheiro suficiente para a segurança alimentar? À semelhança do que acontece com a ecologização, as pessoas falam da segurança alimentar como se de um chavão se tratasse.
Estamos a lutar contra a jurisdição militar e pelo primado do direito, o qual não é compatível com a jurisdição militar.
Estamos a melhorar a nossa colaboração com a NATO, a partilhar informações sobre as nossas operações pela primeira vez com o objectivo de desenvolver as nossas relações. Na sexta-feira passada, co-presidi com o Secretário-Geral Rasmussen a reunião do Comité Político e de Segurança (CPS) e o Conselho do Atlântico Norte no primeiro debate que travámos sobre a Líbia. Há ainda a nossa colaboração com a União Africana com o Presidente Jean Ping, e com a Liga Árabe com Amr Moussa e, naturalmente, com o seu sucessor, e com a Organização da Conferência Islâmica e com o Professor Insanoglu, sob a liderança do enviado especial das Nações Unidas, Al-Khatib.
Estamos a pedir facilidade para financiar as agências públicas, critérios sustentáveis para a biomassa lenhosa utilizada para a produção de energia e, finalmente, uma gestão pró-activa viável das florestas adaptadas às alterações climáticas.
Estamos a pedir testes de resistência exaustivos e vinculativos, realizados por peritos independentes.
Estamos a perder o espírito europeu.
Estamos a procurar abandonar os valores de referência históricos e individuais e transitar para prémios baseados na superfície. O papel dos pequenos agricultores deve ser reconhecido e, com base na subsidiariedade, os EstadosMembros devem decidir eles próprios sobre como apoiar estes pequenos agricultores. A importância dos jovens agricultores é mencionada.
Estamos a produzir demasiada legislação que é aplicada a vários níveis, e, por isso, o mercado interno não funciona como devia.
Estamos a receber mensagens dissonantes nesta Câmara. O Conselho Europeu diz uma coisa, o Banco Central Europeu outra diferente e o Fundo Monetário Internacional outra ainda.
Estamos a reforçar a Estratégia "Europa 2020”, que se destina a preparar a UE para enfrentar os desafios colocados pela concorrência da China e de outras economias em rápido crescimento e para promover a nossa transição para energias mais renováveis.
Estamos a tentar estabelecer uma resposta coordenada, responsável e coerente a todas as questões relacionadas com a migração e as fronteiras porque está tudo ligado. Não podemos estabelecer uma política de vistos se não existir controlo das fronteiras. Não podemos estabelecer uma protecção credível das pessoas que pedem asilo se não existir uma política comum de asilo na União Europeia. Não podemos ter uma migração legal que trabalha se não trabalharmos também com a integração, e não podemos combater a migração irregular se não existir uma política adequada e decente de regresso e de readmissão. Portanto, para termos tudo isto, necessitamos de uma estrutura clara e necessitamos de uma estrutura europeia.
Estamos a ter um pequeno problema com a Internet. Não tenho a lista correcta dos oradores e o quadro electrónico mostra ainda o relatório Klinz.
Estamos a trabalhar juntos em matéria de migração legal, estamos a tentar reforçar a Frontex; e tenho vindo a prometer-vos uma comunicação sobre integração desde a minha audição em Fevereiro passado e, já no ano passado, propusemos uma melhor governação de Schengen.
Estamos a trabalhar também em conjunto com os Estados-Membros em matéria de recuperação, tendo transmitido uma série de informações ao relator a respeito da situação da recuperação de verbas.
Estamos a tratar de reafectar os meios do Eurostat e melhorar a sua gestão, a fim de nos concentrarmos nas nossas grandes prioridades.
Estamos a viver uma crise de uma dimensão extraordinária que já durou muito tempo e ameaça durar ainda mais.
Estamos actualmente a considerar a possibilidade e a analisar a forma de complementar este mecanismo de avaliação, a fim de criar confiança mútua e garantir uma aplicação coerente das regras.
Estamos agora a falar sobre o segundo ano deste período de dez anos e a verdade é que não podemos dizer que só atingiremos os objectivos fixados muito mais tarde.
Estamos ainda a planear a terceira; portanto, o trabalho está em curso e vai prosseguir.
Estamos apenas a sugerir que a Comissão não volte as costas a um sector que precisa urgentemente de ajuda, uma ajuda que, hoje, pode revestir a forma de um aumento das ajudas de minimis.
Estamos aqui a falar da confirmação, por parte dos ministros das finanças, de que os fundos da UE foram gastos correctamente nos seus países de origem.
Estamos aqui num debate que foge às questões essenciais, ou seja, que foge a este problema grave do capitalismo internacional, a este problema grave dos mercados financeiros a controlarem as nossas economias, a tentarem impor as suas regras aos próprios países, a continuarem a aprofundar as desigualdades, as descriminações, os ataques aos direitos dos trabalhadores, dos serviços públicos essenciais, a contribuírem para o aumento da pobreza e da exclusão social, não só no plano internacional, nos países menos desenvolvidos, mas igualmente aqui na União Europeia e em muitos dos nossos Estados-Membros.
Estamos cientes de que, se pretendemos ser bem sucedidos a nível da aplicação plena do Tratado de Lisboa - e isto é o que o relatório diz - também necessitamos desse financiamento sustentável no âmbito do próximo quadro.
Estamos completamente ao vosso lado e, embora a velocidade que pedem seja talvez um pouco elevada de mais, podem estar certos de que estamos conscientes de que esse será o próximo passo.
Estamos conscientes de que, no que respeita à mobilidade, será necessária uma mudança, a fim de proteger o clima. Nós, no Grupo dos Verdes/Aliança Livre Europeia queremos proteger o clima e assegurar a mobilidade para o futuro, razão por que é imperioso que exista concorrência leal.
Estamos convictos de que a Europa pode ser líder mundial nesta transformação profunda, não das nossas infra-estruturas e organizações, mas também, e ainda mais significativamente, da nossa maneira de produzir, consumir e viver.
Estamos de acordo com a ideia da Comissão dos Transportes e do Turismo de definir alguns princípios gerais sobre o modo como os acordos sobre transportes aéreos devem ser avaliados em termos de substância.
Estamos de acordo em que há outras causas para essas falhas, mas os nossos recentes inquéritos Eurobarómetro mostram que os obstáculos relacionados com o direito dos contratos ficam em primeiro lugar numa lista de onze detectados nas transacções entre empresas e consumidores. É por isso que temos de nos ver livres destes obstáculos, um por um, começando já pelo direito dos contratos.
Estamos de acordo quanto à importância fundamental das nossas relações com a Rússia, tanto no contexto bilateral como no contexto multilateral, a nível regional ou a nível mundial.
Estamos de acordo sobre estes testes.
Estamos de acordo: o investimento em investigação e desenvolvimento, em redes transeuropeias de transportes, energia e telecomunicações deve ser aumentado.
Estamos decididos a confirmar o nosso apoio à sua plena adesão ao acordo, embora consideremos que é essencial que os dois países em questão nos informem por escrito, no prazo de seis meses, de que foram tomadas medidas adicionais destinadas a colmatar estas lacunas.
Estamos em tempo de poupança e por isso mesmo temos de ser prudentes na maneira como despendemos o nosso dinheiro. É um facto que 80% do orçamento europeu são despendidos nos Estados-Membros e são por estes geridos.
Estamos empenhados no diálogo com a Itália, a França e a Dinamarca, a fim de esclarecermos exactamente aquilo que foi feito e aquilo que está a ser proposto, e se isso está em conformidade com as regras de Schengen.
Estamos hoje a discutir o facto de não querermos animais clonados porque os requisitos do bem-estar animal não estão a ser cumpridos, o que dá origem a riscos.
Estamos igualmente a apoiar operações na Tunísia, Egipto e Argélia para as pessoas que fugiram da Líbia.
Estamos já a preparar-nos para o trabalho de consulta dos consumidores relativamente a algumas questões fundamentais, nomeadamente: que tipo de informação é importante e de que modo deve ser disponibilizada; qual é a incidência dos desenvolvimentos tecnológicos, tais como o comércio electrónico, nas modalidades de compra de produtos têxteis; em que medida as crescentes exigências em matéria de rastreabilidade, sustentabilidade e responsabilidade social das empresas influenciam o mercado das fibras têxteis; como podemos utilizar melhor as tecnologias disponíveis na era digital; como poderemos nós, Instituições da União Europeia, adequar a nossa legislação às exigências crescentes dos cidadãos relativamente às questões éticas, sociais e ambientais.
Estamos muito satisfeitos com o forte apoio que o Parlamento deu ao conceito das parcerias de inovação em 11 de Novembro de 2010. O Presidente do Parlamento foi convidado a indicar quatro deputados para o conselho de direcção, e estamos ansiosos por que isso aconteça.
Estamos no momento menos indicado para a adopção de atitudes populistas e para a tomada de decisões políticas sem uma visão a longo prazo, que é, a meu ver, o que o Conselho tem, até certo ponto, vindo a fazer. O Conselho, assim como o Parlamento, é responsável pelos europeus.
Estamos num momento histórico para o mundo, e V. Exa. tem a oportunidade de liderar o papel internacional da UE, através por exemplo, de iniciativas como a que anunciou de abrir una representação da União em Bengasi. V. Exa. pode contar com o apoio deste Parlamento, e não apenas com o seu apoio, mas também com o seu mandato para estabelecer, com a maior brevidade possível, uma representação racional, estruturada e coerente da União Europeia na cena internacional.
Estamos particularmente satisfeitos com o apoio previsto para as pequenas explorações agrícolas, que são fundamentais porque se revestem de extrema importância para a protecção dos solos e para a qualidade dos produtos nelas produzidos.
Estamos perante mais uma fastidiosa repetição da habitual retórica da Comissão em relação às questões da aprendizagem ao longo da vida e da promoção da mobilidade a nível da UE, consideradas a melhor garantia para melhorar a empregabilidade e a adaptabilidade dos trabalhadores. A formação profissional é encarada aqui como uma forma de promover o empreendedorismo e de responder à necessidade de criar um ambiente onde as empresas possam ter êxito, desenvolver e crescer, acrescentando que para crescer precisam de uma carga tributária reduzida e previsibilidade para que possam planear e fazer investimentos.
Estamos perante mais uma resolução cheia de contradições. Por um lado, saúda-se a designação, por parte da Comissão, do novo Representante para as PME e apoia-se o seu mandato de acompanhamento dos progressos realizados pelos Estados-Membros na implementação do SBA e de defesa dos interesses das PME em todos os serviços da Comissão, assegurando, em particular, a aplicação efectiva do princípio Think Small First.
Estamos perante um compromisso sobre as normas destinadas a proteger melhor os consumidores e a garantir condições comuns claras para as empresas concorrentes no mercado único.
Estamos perante um intolerável processo de extorsão dos recursos nacionais, dos trabalhadores e do povo português, para os bolsos do capital financeiro. A UE - revelando a sua natureza e reais objectivos - medeia este processo de extorsão, criando as condições institucionais para que o mesmo se efective e aprofunde. O processo de ingerência externa em curso é disso bem revelador.
Estamos perante um relatório que todos devemos saudar, uma vez que afecta a vida quotidiana de todos os cidadãos, mas, no espírito construtivo que me é característico, há alguns aspectos que eu gostaria de destacar.
Estamos perante uma enorme tragédia humana que inclui a perda de muitas vidas e que põe em perigo milhares de muitas outras e perante uma crise de confiança no consumo de alimentos básicos, com consequências económicas e sociais difíceis de prever.
Estamos perante uma matéria de elevada sensibilidade ambiental que requer a máxima atenção por parte dos decisores políticos e um acompanhamento sério e rigoroso da gestão destes resíduos.
Estamos plenamente conscientes do papel específico desempenhado pela Índia em matéria de acesso aos medicamentos a preços acessíveis nos países em desenvolvimento.
Estamos preocupados com questões relacionadas com os pagamentos no âmbito do programa Daphne de combate à violência de género, e temos esperança de que, com o passar dos anos, aumente a sensibilidade sobre esta questão e tenhamos verdadeiramente em conta a perspectiva de género em todos e cada um dos programas operacionais levados a cabo na UE.
Estamos preocupados, muitíssimo preocupados, porque a pior coisa que podia acontecer era que, no futuro próximo, realizássemos testes de stress e que tivéssemos o tipo de resultados que providenciassem a desculpa perfeita para muitos operadores de centrais nucleares obsoletas, incluindo as da zona onde vivo, manterem as centrais em actividade durante ainda mais tempo, em vez de as encerrarem.
Estamos preparados para elaborar programas de assistência técnica para acompanhamento das difíceis medidas de austeridade que as autoridades gregas têm de aplicar.
Estamos prestes a reformular a política comum das pescas e, como tal, é também nossa especial obrigação sermos cautelosos e não agirmos precipitadamente em relação a esta matéria.
Estamos seguramente nas últimas páginas do capítulo do resgate.
Estamos também a analisar de que forma poderemos reforçar a avaliação de Schengen, a fim de garantirmos, previamente, que o actual sistema de revisão pelos pares, que não é muito bom, é substituído por algo realizado a nível europeu, com um papel mais relevante do Parlamento Europeu.
Estamos também a procurar facilitar o acesso por parte dos Estados-Membros aos diversos fundos existentes em matéria de migração, simplificando e facilitando as questões relativas a fronteiras, asilo, integração, etc.
Estamos também disponíveis para discutir com o Parlamento e a Comissão aspectos do possível papel do Conselho sem, claro, atrasar a entrada em vigor do acordo entre estas duas Instituições.
Estamos também particularmente satisfeitos com as amplas referências feitas aos jovens agricultores, que, em certa medida, representam o futuro da agricultura.
Estamos todos conscientes de que uma das características muito frequentes das zonas fronteiriças é uma taxa de desemprego mais elevada do que a média comunitária, embora com diferenças inter-regionais significativas, bem como um elevado nível de desemprego não declarado devido ao facto de as pessoas sem trabalho não estarem contabilizadas.
Estamos totalmente dependentes dos nossos mercados internacionais. O custo elevado do gasóleo levou as transportadoras ao limite.
Estamos, assim, em condições de receber a Bulgária e a Roménia no Espaço Schengen e espero que o Conselho adopte a mesma posição logo que receber o nosso parecer positivo.
Estamos, assim, perante uma questão verdadeiramente transversal e que exige uma abordagem coordenada ao nível comunitário, a qual deverá procurar assegurar que os antimicrobianos se possam manter como uma ferramenta eficaz no combate às doenças, tanto nas pessoas como nos animais, incentivar uma utilização prudente e responsável e limitar ao estritamente necessário qualquer recurso a que eles se faça.
Estamos, como é natural, abertos a uma utilização mais eficiente e a uma melhor aplicação. Concordo que há que evitar os erros, a detenção de pessoas inocentes, etc. A meu ver, uma melhor aplicação é do interesse de todos nós.
Estamos, contudo, extremamente preocupados com o recente surto de violência e, como disse, com a ocupação militar da cidade de Abyei, o que constitui uma violação clara do Acordo de Paz Global (APG). Instamos as partes em questão a abstrair-se de futuras provocações e a negociar as condições para uma coexistência pacífica a longo prazo das comunidades locais residentes em Abyei e nas redondezas.
Estamos, pois, a trabalhar de forma muito afincada para levar estas negociação a bom porto, e existe uma oportunidade real de o conseguirmos. A Índia está claramente interessada ao mais alto nível político. A Cimeira UE-Índia, em Dezembro, culminou num firme compromisso, expresso por ambas as partes, com vista à conclusão das negociações o mais rapidamente possível.
Estamos, por conseguinte, perante más notícias adicionais, desta vez vindas de Espanha, um país que há muito tempo luta por manter a confiança dos investidores.
Estamos, porém, confrontados com o envelhecimento das centrais nucleares e com a prática da subcontratação. 80% dos que trabalham na indústria nuclear são subcontratados.
Estando esgotado o tempo atribuído ao período de perguntas, às perguntas que não obtiveram resposta será dada resposta por escrito (ver Anexo).
Estando fora da zona euro, a Grã-Bretanha deverá ficar imune a essas dívidas, mas o nosso governo anterior contraiu dívidas no valor de 10 mil milhões de libras esterlinas, nos termos da cláusula do Tratado de Lisboa que se refere a circunstâncias excepcionais, e o governo actual vai continuar a conceder empréstimos directa e indirectamente. A Grécia e a Irlanda entrarão, mais cedo ou mais tarde, em situação de incumprimento relativamente às suas dívidas, e isso será uma demonstração de que aplicámos mal o nosso dinheiro.
Estando tanto a Roménia como a Bulgária, neste momento, preparadas para a abertura das fronteiras, apesar do facto da fronteira Bulgária-Grécia ser muito sensível, é necessário que a Bulgária tome medidas adicionais e que seja adoptada uma abordagem comum tripartida (Bulgária-Grécia-Turquia).
Estaremos a dar força aos argumentos de populistas, de extremistas e, em alguns casos, de xenófobos que querem pôr em causa o grande acervo comunitário neste domínio. É por este motivo que consideramos que a melhor forma de não pôr Schengen em risco é precisamente reforçar as regras de governação de Schengen e clarificar alguns dos seus aspectos.
Estaremos a facilitar demasiado a nossa tarefa se simplesmente determinarmos que as regiões mais prósperas também exigem um apoio específico. A meu ver, isto é um convite ao desperdício de dinheiro.
Estará a Comissão disposta a reafectar, pelo menos, 10 % dos 51 mil milhões de euros anuais actualmente destinados aos fundos regionais e de coesão como financiamento de arranque para novas redes eléctricas no domínio das energias renováveis?
Estará a Comissão em condições de reiterar o seu apoio a uma política agrícola comum forte e adequadamente provida de recursos no âmbito do próximo quadro financeiro plurianual?
Estará absolutamente certo de que se trata do método mais seguro? Na minha opinião, não é. Nem é o usado noutros países.
Estaríamos efectivamente a desenvolver uma dupla personalidade, considerando que aprovámos resoluções sobre a aplicação da Estratégia Europa 2020 e que estamos a elaborar relatórios, tal como estou eu próprio a fazer, sobre a aplicação da plataforma contra a pobreza. A governação económica que está a ser proposta...
Estas agências são uma expressão evidente da financeirização da economia - sem tradução nem correspondência em real acréscimo de actividade produtiva - e constituem peça central da estratégia de desenvolvimento do neoliberalismo, sempre em busca de taxas de lucro que a produção real não pode assegurar, em virtude da bem conhecida baixa tendencial da taxa de lucro.
Estas agências são, na sua génese, intermediárias de informação, que facilitam o acesso ao mercado aos emitentes de dividida e aos investidores, permitindo uma redução nos custos de informação e consequentemente uma maior liquidez e transparência.
Estas alterações vão ainda mais longe do que a proposta inicial da Comissão para o regulamento, pois alargam consideravelmente o âmbito dos mecanismos de reexame dos acordos e de retirada das autorizações que são já uma fonte de grande preocupação para os Estados-Membros e para muitos deputados do Parlamento.
Estas aplicações, actualmente baseadas em grande parte no sistema GPS norte-americano, representam cerca de 6% do PIB total da UE.
Estas cedências comerciais, como reconhece o próprio relatório, irão prejudicar a indústria têxtil da União Europeia e os países e regiões dela mais dependentes.
Estas contas de sustentabilidade que vamos adoptar hoje e amanhã constituirão o primeiro passo.
Estas conversações estão reflectidas no programa. O programa português merece o apoio da União Europeia e do Fundo Monetário Internacional. A nossa assistência conjunta de 78 mil milhões de euros é demonstrativa de um forte compromisso em ajudar Portugal e em salvaguardar a estabilidade financeira da Europa.
Estas devem ser objecto das necessárias avaliações e controlos de impacto, para que não haja tomadas de decisão precipitadas que podem ser contraproducentes, aumentando os obstáculos à entrada nos mercados e o risco de notações mais prudentes, com os respectivos efeitos sobre a economia real e os empréstimos.
Estas discussões contribuirão para o processo de preparação da sessão do Conselho Europeu de 21 de Junho, que abordará as mesmas questões.
Estas empresas escolhem amiúde as suas vítimas entre empresas sedeadas noutro Estado-Membro.
Estas expulsões constituem um dos acontecimentos mais sombrios da história europeia. O último século foi descrito, não sem razão, como o século das expulsões. Prestamos, hoje, homenagem a todas as vítimas destes actos desumanos.
Estas foram as exigências feitas imediatamente após a Segunda Guerra Mundial.
Estas incluem os direitos aduaneiros, as medidas não tarifárias, os investimentos e os contratos de direito público.
Estas iniciativas foram criadas na sequência de consultas abrangentes com associações de pequenas e médias empresas e com as autoridades relevantes.
Estas intervenções, que são apenas algumas entre muitas, são específicas e necessárias para manter os equilíbrios que são essenciais para os territórios. O meu apoio a este relatório reconhece o excelente trabalho levado a cabo pelo senhor deputado Mikolášik e é prestado na esperança de que a política de coesão, mesmo no próximo período de programação, prossiga o seu caminho de agregação e desenvolvimento dos territórios e da economia europeia..
Estas leis quase impossibilitam que um governo futuro governe o país. Temos a impressão, como referiu um dos nossos colegas, de que o Governo é como uma equipa de futebol que tenta alterar as regras e o árbitro durante o jogo. Não é assim que se tratam os opositores políticos e não é, sem dúvida, este o funcionamento de uma democracia no século XXI.
Estas medidas excepcionais terminaram a 31 de Dezembro de 2010 e a sua não prorrogação traria graves consequências na produção de riqueza, pondo em causa a sua recuperação económica e os processos internos de reforma e de transição. Assim, concordo com as alterações propostas pelo relator, bem como com a prorrogação destas medidas até 31 de Dezembro de 2015 e com a salvaguarda dos ajustamentos necessários no âmbito dos novos acordos bilaterais com a Bósnia e Herzegovina e a Sérvia.
Estas medidas ficarão intrinsecamente ligadas a todas as outras medidas de longo prazo propostas, como a preparação para uma política de imigração comum. O reforço da Frontex e a demonstração de uma maior solidariedade são aspectos particularmente cruciais - e com este ponto termino - para apoiar os Estados-Membros situados nas nossas fronteiras externas. A situação no Mediterrâneo em anos recentes só serve para pôr em destaque as deficiências no acervo de Schengen.
Estas medidas podem representar uma economia de milhões de euros por ano às empresas europeias e canadianas, graças a procedimentos de certificação de produtos mais rápidos e mais simples e, portanto, menos onerosos. A aceitação recíproca dos resultados da certificação constitui um grande benefício para a UE uma vez que estabelecerá a aceitação recíproca dos resultados do procedimento de certificação em todos os domínios da aeronavegabilidade para todos os Estados-Membros.
Estas medidas são, portanto, indissociáveis da situação hoje existente na região dos Balcãs - designadamente na Bósnia e Herzegovina, na Sérvia e no Kosovo - de grave crise económica e social.
Estas melhorias irão contribuir para impulsionar a inovação na Europa, facilitando a comercialização de novos alimentos sem quaisquer concessões em matéria de segurança. Este dossiê exige a nossa atenção concertada no sentido de aplicar estas melhorias sem mais demora, uma vez que elas trarão enormes benefícios quer em termos de protecção do consumidor quer em termos de inovação no sector alimentar.
Estas metas são ambiciosas, tendo em conta que a situação actual é muito instável e obriga os jovens a viver num eterno estado de incerteza, muito distantes da perspectiva encorajadora de um emprego estável no futuro e do seu lugar na sociedade.
Estas novas concessões são absurdas, uma vez que se concentram num sector - o dos têxteis - que é dominante no Paquistão, mas que, em contrapartida, na Europa, foi destruído, precisamente como resultado da concorrência desleal dos países asiáticos.
Estas novas disposições da Directiva Eurovinheta, permitirão que os Estados-Membros incorporem nas portagens cobradas aos veículos pesados de mercadorias, para além do custo da utilização da infra-estrutura, um montante correspondente ao custo da poluição sonora e atmosférica originada pelo tráfego.
Estas organizações privadas e orientadas para o lucro detêm demasiado poder sobre Estados soberanos e apoio plenamente os planos para enfrentar esta anomalia a nível europeu.
Estas pessoas são claramente uma razão para a acção e solidariedade europeias. A Comissão convidou todos os Estados-Membros para uma conferência, a realizar-se em 12 de Maio, para debater a redistribuição e a prorrogação do projecto de Malta, a fim de dar assistência a Malta relativamente aos milhares de pessoas que têm estado a chegar a este país. Mas também vamos ter aqui o Alto Comissariado das Nações Unidas para os Refugiados (UNHCR), pelo que vamos tentar pedir aos Estados-Membros que assumam maiores responsabilidades pelos refugiados que fogem da violência crescente na Líbia e que estão retidos na Tunísia e na fronteira.
Estas políticas não servem os interesses dos cidadãos da Europa, nem as suas esperanças de crescimento real.
Estas preferências comerciais foram concedidas por um período que termina em 31 de Dezembro de 2010. O fim das preferências comerciais poderia retirar aos beneficiários uma vantagem económica objectiva nas suas trocas comerciais com a UE, podendo ter sérias consequências nos desempenhos económicos globais de todos os Balcãs Ocidentais, com repercussões negativas nos seus processos internos de reforma e transição e comprometendo inclusive a sua recuperação económica. A presente proposta, que votei favoravelmente, visa prorrogar a validade destas medidas até 31 de Dezembro de 2015.
Estas propostas de alteração de duas directivas são fundamentais para a sobrevivência das empresas fabris europeias. A Comissão propõe a isenção de 50% dos tractores fabricados na UE nos últimos cinco anos devido ao atraso tecnológico, que não permite - sem um enorme dispêndio de dinheiro - proceder às modificações mecânicas necessárias para se passar à fase seguinte, e devido à crise económica que está a afectar o mercado dos tractores, cujo volume de negócios sofreu uma quebra de 20% por ano desde 2008.
Estas propostas de directrizes de negociação foram partilhadas com o Parlamento, sujeitas aos devidos requisitos de confidencialidade. O Conselho está a analisar essas directrizes, e aguardamos com expectativa o parecer do Parlamento a seu respeito. A altura e a forma como este capítulo poderá ser negociado dependerão, em última análise, da data em que o Conselho chegará a acordo quanto às directrizes de negociação suplementares.
Estas propostas têm conduzido a que as pessoas em causa tenham vindo a exercer pressões (lobbying) sem precedentes, envolvendo inclusivamente deputados aqui nesta Assembleia.
Estas questões são, sem dúvida, importantes, mas a proposta tem motivações puramente políticas. A introdução de novos critérios criaria um sistema a dois níveis nos Estados-Membros.
Estas reduções fazem parte de um esforço para sair da crise.
Estas regras técnicas visam a aproximação da legislação dos Estados-Membros tendo em vista a aplicação, para cada tipo de veículo, do procedimento de homologação CE previsto pela Directiva 2007/46/CE. Por conseguinte, as disposições da Directiva 2007/46/CE, relativas aos sistemas, componentes e unidades técnicas para veículos aplicam-se à presente directiva.
Estas regras técnicas, respeitantes à aproximação das legislações dos Estados-Membros, permitem que o procedimento de homologação CE estabelecido pela Directiva 2003/37/CE seja aplicado relativamente a cada modelo de tractor.
Estas reservas não podem ser disponibilizadas através, por exemplo, da incorporação de todas as políticas ou objectivos em matéria de eficiência energética, de transportes e outros na política de coesão. A redução dos recursos dos programas existentes não substituirá a necessidade de novos recursos adicionais se quisermos definir novos objectivos para a União Europeia, se quisermos que a integração europeia proporcione verdadeiro valor acrescentado, nomeadamente para os contribuintes, que estão atentos, e bem, a todos os cêntimos afectados ao orçamento europeu.
Estas restrições permitirão também melhorar o estado das infra-estruturas, que sofrem mais danos nesses períodos de ponta do tráfego.
Estas situações de emergência foram resolvidas através de políticas desenvolvidas conjuntamente pela UE, o FMI, o BCE e os governos dos respectivos Estados-Membros.
Estas são as três coisas de que necessitamos. Há muitos aspectos diferentes que aqui poderíamos mencionar e que exigem a partilha de tarefas.
Estas tendências não se esbateram, antes se agudizaram, com a Guerra Fria. O caminho que a Rússia empreendeu rumo à democracia pluralista de matriz liberal tem conhecido avanços e recuos, mas é inegável o caminho percorrido desde os tempos da Cortina de Ferro. Não obstante, é inútil negar o muito que ainda há a fazer neste tocante, bem como a evidência de que a União Europeia e a Federação Russa têm não só um património histórico, cultural e religioso comum como interesses e desafios que são coincidentes e que justificam uma aproximação aos mais diversos níveis. A União Europeia deve continuar a trabalhar para que esta convergência seja possível e frutuosa.
Estas três pessoas trabalham no complexo britânico. A senhora gostaria, muito justamente, de encontrar os recursos necessários para resolver esta situação. Para a ajudar, eu gostaria de salientar que há sete funcionários da União Europeia nas Bahamas. O que se passa nas Bahamas que é tão infinitamente mais decisivo para o destino da União Europeia, em comparação com Bagdad? Não seria melhor ter 17 funcionários em Bagdad, uma vez que estamos em vias de assinar o primeiro acordo UE-Iraque da história, no período pós-Saddam? Talvez eles pudessem até resolver in situ o drama do Campo de Ashraf, já que estou certo de que a intervenção pessoal da Senhora Baronesa poderia facilmente conduzir a uma solução positiva.
Estava aterrorizada com as cartas ao ponto de ter medo de as abrir quando chegavam à sua caixa de correio.
Este Acordo de Parceria pode sem dúvida melhorar a visibilidade da frota do atum da UE no Atlântico, oferecendo às embarcações, e às áreas da UE dependentes delas, um quadro jurídico estável a prazo médio, e contribuindo para a continuidade das zonas de pesca cobertas pelos acordos no Golfo da Guiné. É, no entanto, desejável que a comissão mista reúna mais frequentemente no futuro, e que seja permitida a participação nas reuniões de representantes do Parlamento Europeu na qualidade de observadores.
Este Acordo deveria ser juridicamente vinculativo e abrangente, e deveria abranger todas as áreas relacionadas com a democracia, o Estado de direito, o respeito dos direitos humanos e dos direitos fundamentais
Este Acordo deverá gerar economias para as empresas europeias e canadianas de aviação graças a procedimentos de certificação de produtos simplificados mais rápidos e, desta forma, menos onerosos, e à aceitação recíproca dos resultados da certificação. Ainda segundo a relatora, o Acordo poderá incrementar a segurança em virtude de as autoridades responsáveis pela regulamentação e aplicação estarem a aproximar-se para cooperarem em todos os domínios respeitantes à certificação, inspecção e aplicação, tendo em vista assegurar o mais alto nível de segurança para os passageiros e os transportes de carga.
Este Acordo deverá gerar economias para as empresas europeias e canadianas de aviação graças a procedimentos de certificação de produtos simplificados, mais rápidos e, desta forma, menos onerosos, e à aceitação recíproca dos resultados da certificação.
Este Acordo refere-se a certos aspectos da segurança da aviação civil, não entrando nas questões de criação de um espaço de aviação totalmente aberto entre estes dois países, o que, segundo a relatora, deve ser objecto de uma recomendação em separado. O principal objectivo do Acordo é minimizar a duplicação das avaliações, dos ensaios e dos controlos, salvaguardada a inexistência de diferenças significativas ao nível da regulamentação, permitindo que a UE e o Canadá confiem nos sistemas de certificação de cada uma das partes.
Este Acordo traz consigo o reconhecimento mútuo de sistemas de certificação para produtos, peças ou equipamentos aeronáuticos, em termos de aeronavegabilidade e manutenção. Isto evita que as empresas cujos produtos tenham sido certificados num país tenham de passar por todo o processo de certificação noutro país. Esta simplificação representa boas notícias para um mercado que vale perto de 50 000 milhões de euros em trocas comerciais entre as duas regiões.
Este Acordo é mutuamente vantajoso para a UE e as Seicheles: por um lado, contribui substancialmente para a estabilização do mercado europeu das conservas de atum, através da concessão de licenças de pesca para tunídeos, promovendo inclusive a criação de 760 postos de trabalho na Europa; por outro, graças ao apoio sectorial da contrapartida financeira concedida para o sector das pescas, as Seicheles aumentam as suas capacidades em matéria de gestão dos recursos haliêuticos e vigilância das pescas.
Este Acordo é um primeiro passo, embora seja sem dúvida um passo importante, para alcançar uma maior transparência, ao tornar obrigatório de facto o registo de todos os lobbyistas que queiram usufruir de um acesso permanente ao PE e à Comissão, do qual deverão constar todos os elementos que permitam identificar a estrutura legal e interesses financeiros dessa organização.
Este Conselho Europeu deve enviar um sinal claro de que se a posição de um país é insustentável na área do euro, então, a menos que esse país efectue mudanças radicais, a área do euro não deve hesitar em levantar a possibilidade de reestruturar a sua dívida ou mesmo - por muito cruel que pareça - de esse país abandonar o clube.
Este Fundo presta assistência aos empregados atingidos pelos efeitos da globalização e da crise. O ponto em questão é da responsabilidade da Comissão do Emprego e dos Assuntos Sociais, é apresentado por iniciativa da Comissão do Desenvolvimento Regional e deve ser possível rejeitá-lo durante a votação em separado, que terá lugar mais tarde.
Este Fundo é também extremamente importante em termos de dotações financeiras e âmbito de aplicação, e o seu montante é 64% superior ao do seu antecessor, o 9.º Fundo Europeu de Desenvolvimento.
Este Parlamento devia envergonhar-se de si próprio, em particular o Grupo da Aliança dos Democratas e Liberais pela Europa e o Grupo do Partido Popular Europeu (Democratas-Cristãos). Enquanto nos Países Baixos, note-se, o Governo Rutte deixa os doentes e os deficientes à sua sorte, os mesmos grupos que o constituem têm, nesta Assembleia, enorme facilidade em desperdiçar dinheiro.
Este Parlamento está disposto a trabalhar com lealdade para criar esse mecanismo, um mecanismo que não faça double standards, isto é, que não seja mais exigente com os países candidatos do que com aqueles que já são membros do clube.
Este Parlamento não pode aceitar um corte no financiamento destinado ao desenvolvimento rural.
Este acordo celebrado entre a CE e o Canadá em matéria de segurança na aviação civil vem no seguimento do Acordo horizontal já aprovado pelo Parlamento Europeu em Março de 2011. O Canadá é um país estratégico para os Estados europeus neste domínio e é actualmente o 11º parceiro comercial mais importante da UE, uma vez que ambas as partes dispõem de fábricas líderes a nível mundial de produção de aeronaves, motores e electrónica espacial.
Este acordo comercial, tanto quanto sei, poderá reduzir potencialmente as movimentações destinadas a acabar com a importação deste tipo de petróleo para a Europa. O movimento sindical canadiano e europeu, juntamente com activistas ambientais e defensores dos povos indígenas, precisam de unir esforços para lutar em conjunto e resistir a esta proposta de acordo.
Este acordo deve, em particular, respeitar os modelos sociais e ambientais de ambas as partes - dos Estados-Membros e do Canadá - e a sua capacidade para continuarem a legislar nas áreas que são sensíveis para as nossas sociedades.
Este acordo inclui, além disso, cláusulas de suspensão, caso uma das partes verifique uma violação dos elementos essenciais relativos aos direitos humanos.
Este acordo palestiniano constitui um acontecimento político fundamental e, ao contrário do que acaba de se dizer aqui, o Hamas, pela primeira vez, aceitou que a OLP e a Autoridade Palestiniana fossem seus parceiros nas negociações. Aceitou as fronteiras de 1967 e as condições do Quarteto, incluindo a rejeição da violência.
Este acordo permitiu a criação de 230 empregos a bordo em benefício da população das Seicheles, de 2 900 postos de trabalho nas Seicheles e de 760 postos de trabalho na Europa em diversas áreas do sector.
Este acordo será uma Carta de privatização, particularmente em termos de água, telecomunicações e electricidade. O capítulo relativo aos investimentos conferirá, escandalosamente, às corporações o direito de processar os governos quando as políticas sociais ou ambientais travarem os seus lucros.
Este acordo tem um grande número de aspectos positivos.
Este ano assinala-se o 25.º aniversário da catástrofe nuclear na cidade ucraniana de Chernobil.
Este ano, o Conselho fez novamente tudo o que pôde para impedir o nosso trabalho de auditoria.
Este aponta para uma questão da maior importância e que não tem vindo a ser debatida com suficiente frequência, designadamente, a necessidade de as autoridades nacionais actuarem, em cooperação com a Comissão Europeia, no sentido de prevenir o desemprego ao ajustarem "por medida" a formação profissional às necessidades do mercado de trabalho.
Este aspecto deve também estar associado à possibilidade de apreensão dos navios em qualquer porto da UE caso existam motivos para suspeitar que houve incumprimento da lei.
Este aspecto é extremamente importante para todos os países da Europa, sendo que o conteúdo da segunda parte do n.º 36 e o n.º 37 constitui uma tentativa de assegurar a legalidade e combater a actividade criminosa contra as florestas na Europa.
Este aspecto é relevante para reforçar a confiança do Mercado na concepção e na credibilidade dos testes. A Comissão, o Comité Europeu do Risco Sistémico (ESRB) e a Autoridade Bancária Europeia (ABE) deverão formar uma ideia clara daquilo que os testes de esforço devem mostrar e devem verificar e assegurar que os pressupostos dos testes de esforço reflectem os riscos.
Este assunto tem de ser mais amplamente debatido, mas, como disse, tudo será em vão se o orçamento for insuficiente.
Este ataque marcou a rotura da aliança que existia anteriormente e do pacto secreto entre Hitler e Estaline, feito em Agosto de 1939, pacto esse que dividiu a Europa.
Este aumento necessário do orçamento europeu deve ser acompanhado de economias substanciais realizadas através da optimização das despesas (partilhadas). Além disso, a política agrícola comum (PAC), essencial para a segurança e a independência alimentar do nosso continente, e a política regional da UE, reforçada pela criação de uma categoria intermédia de regiões que permite conceder um apoio financeiro suplementar às regiões cujo PIB per capita se situa entre 75 % e 90 % da média europeia, como Auvergne e Limousin, ocupam no relatório o lugar que lhes é devido.
Este avanço tecnológico permitirá às empresas europeias inovar e posicionarem-se na linha da frente dos serviços possibilitados pela tecnologia de posicionamento global.
Este cenário pode ter consequências catastróficas para a saúde humana. A resistência aos antibióticos representa um problema de séria gravidade que pode ser resolvido de imediato e com eficácia.
Este compromisso constituiu a base do subsequente pedido de derrogação à OMC.
Este conflito está a ameaçar o processo de paz que devia ter ocorrido após o referendo de Janeiro de 2011.
Este contexto levanta a seguinte importante questão: que futuro têm a política comum das pescas e o Fundo Europeu das Pescas? Se este fundo não está a ser muito utilizado, isso significa que precisa de ser revisto e reformulado.
Este debate deve ser realizado em conjunto com os nossos colegas dos parlamentos nacionais sem preconceitos e diminuindo o azedume que é evidente em algumas capitais e em alguns comentários.
Este desafio envolve satisfazer interesses nacionais, que são muitíssimo diversos, e, em simultâneo, melhorar o valor acrescentado europeu, que é reflectido no quadro financeiro plurianual.
Este desastre afectou particularmente a Bielorrússia e, na minha opinião, é insultuoso que os cidadãos deste país sejam impedidos de participar na cerimónia oficial de comemoração.
Este dinheiro não é um brinde oferecido por Bruxelas. É apenas uma pequena percentagem do dinheiro que sai dos bolsos dos contribuintes para ser gasto exactamente onde a Comissão pretende, com a ameaça adicional de termos de publicitar que isto ou aquilo nos foi dado pela UE, para não termos de pagar uma multa.
Este dinheiro será reinvestido em infra-estruturas de transporte de qualquer tipo, devendo um mínimo de 15% das receitas ser canalizado para projectos da RTE-T. Considero que precisamos igualmente de medidas a longo prazo para lograr a convergência nos métodos de cálculo dos custos externos no contexto de todos os sistemas de tarifação dos EstadosMembros, o que poderia garantir a transparência dos sinais dados ao sector europeu dos transportes rodoviários.
Este documento introduz requisitos estritos que as ANC devem observar a fim de erradicar potenciais conflitos de interesses e para melhorar a qualidade da notação e das metodologias, bem como da transparência das notações.
Este documento traz o espírito das guerras dos Balcãs à Europa Central. O Presidente do Parlamento da Hungria, László Kövér, afirmou recentemente sobre as barragens de Gabčíkovo-Nagymaros que era necessária uma intervenção militar do lado húngaro, que o Tratado de Paris não se aplica à Eslováquia, e questionou igualmente as fronteiras eslovacas no contexto do espírito desta Constituição.
Este duplo desafio faz com que a sustentabilidade da dívida seja um objectivo praticamente inalcançável.
Este envolve, em primeiro lugar, cuidados de saúde, incluindo a investigação clínica e preventiva e tecnologias médicas. O cancro é a segunda causa de morte mais comum na Europa, e dado que a população está a envelhecer, espera-se que um em cada três homens e uma em cada quatro mulheres terá uma experiência directa da doença até aos 75 anos. A investigação sobre o cancro está à beira de uma série de avanços, especialmente no que respeita a métodos mais precisos e menos dispendiosos, e ainda a métodos menos penosos para os pacientes, tanto ao nível dos check-ups (diagnóstico de controlo) preventivos como dos tratamentos. O financiamento da investigação sobre o cancro pode salvar a vida de pessoas e reduzir os custos do tratamento.
Este equilíbrio de pagamentos não só será mais justo, mas mobilizará também melhor as diversas estruturas envolvidas na produção agrícola a fim de responder aos novos objectivos que estamos a estabelecer a nós próprios, pois os exemplos históricos baseados em dotações recebidas antecipadamente já não se justificam no contexto em que estamos agora a definir objectivos muito claros para a futura política agrícola comum.
Este era o elo que faltava e conclui o procedimento de uma forma muito lógica, semelhante à que está prevista na supervisão orçamental.
Este esforço de aproveitamento dos meios à disposição tenderá a contribuir para melhorar as oportunidades de crescimento sustentável e reduzir as disparidades entre regiões e facilitar a inclusão social e a coesão entre regiões. Este esforço não resultará sem um claro estabelecimento de prioridades por parte da União e dos Estados-Membros que permita evitar a dispersão de fundos e potenciar o que é realmente essencial prosseguir. A flexibilidade que se deseja deve ser acompanhada de uma fiscalização rigorosa da aplicação dos fundos de forma a que esta se faça com o máximo respeito pelas regras do rigor e da transparência.
Este estado de coisas tem de ser levado em conta, a fim de tornar mais fácil a obtenção de empréstimos para esses fins por parte das pequenas e médias empresas. É igualmente importante referir que os procedimentos administrativos neste âmbito precisam de ser simplificados.
Este estudo deve constituir a base para a forma como os consumidores podem obter, através da etiquetagem, "informações exactas sobre o país de origem e informações suplementares que garantam a total rastreabilidade dos produtos têxteis". Espero que esta base se traduza numa legislação sensata e útil.
Este exemplo ilustra a necessidade de transparência na transferência de resíduos e de inspecções oficiais fidedignas.
Este facto abalou a confiança dos cidadãos neste processo.
Este facto demonstra a utilização generalizada de antibióticos na criação de animais, e devo referir que os agricultores europeus estão fartos de serem os únicos a adoptar e a cumprir normas, correndo o risco de perderem rendimentos.
Este facto está bem patente nas conclusões do Conselho "Assuntos Externos” de 31 de Janeiro.
Este facto exige o desenvolvimento de um quadro europeu que inclua objectivos, direitos e valores partilhados. A Estratégia Europa 2020 tem de centrar-se na criação de uma sociedade inclusiva aumentando o emprego. A diminuição das taxas de abandono escolar e a redução da pobreza apenas podem ser conseguidas proporcionando a todas as crianças um futuro que abra caminho a uma vida melhor.
Este facto imprime um novo ímpeto à perspectiva europeia para os Balcãs ocidentais. O Conselho Europeu regressará a esta matéria na sua reunião de Dezembro de 2011.
Este facto levou a uma situação em que o povo da Mongólia não está a beneficiar dos recursos do país. Tem de trabalhar em muito más condições, com alguns trabalhadores, por exemplo, a extraírem o ouro com mercúrio.
Este facto marcaria o fim das tradições jurídicas nacionais e das leis que cada Estado-Membro estabeleceu em matérias tão sensíveis como o direito civil e dos contratos. Não obstante, apesar de o objectivo da criação de um instrumento facultativo ser facilitar o comércio transfronteiriço, tendo em conta as devidas necessidades dos consumidores e das empresas, devemos ter presente que a legislação europeia existente já responde às necessidades dos vários intervenientes.
Este facto não implica que a pessoa visada por um Mandado de Detenção Europeu não possa, e não deva, exercer os seus direitos no Estado de execução. A Directiva 2010/64/UE de 20 de Outubro de 2010 estabelece o direito à interpretação e tradução em processo penal e aplica-se igualmente ao Mandado de Detenção Europeu.
Este facto resulta de, ao contrário da extradição, o Mandado de Detenção Europeu constituir um sistema plenamente judicial.
Este facto suscita uma questão que gostaria de colocar sobre o direito fundamental desses possíveis membros de gerações futuras - o direito a nascerem. A preocupação com os futuros seres humanos constitui um valor europeu - ou não? Talvez não europeu, apenas húngaro? Então a Europa deveria agradecer à Hungria por lhe recordar alguns aspectos essenciais.
Este facto é preocupante, dado que as crianças desfavorecidas são as que comprovadamente beneficiam mais do acesso a serviços deste tipo.
Este facto, conjugado com as alterações climáticas, constitui motivo suficiente para mobilizar todos os Estados-Membros da UE e para se envidarem esforços comuns e consistentes em prol da gestão das florestas da União. Estes esforços têm de ser acompanhados por adaptações políticas no domínio da energia, da indústria, do comércio, da investigação e da coesão, incluindo a política regional e o Fundo de Solidariedade.
Este fenómeno está, no entanto, associado ao risco de esses países - e, em particular, as suas empresas - exportarem normas laborais menos exigentes do que as da União Europeia.
Este financiamento não deve ser reduzido na actual situação económica da UE, pelo contrário, devemos disponibilizar mais verbas.
Este foi um grande esforço da Bélgica, creio que o podemos dizer, iniciado sob a Presidência belga do Conselho, com três personalidades belgas envolvidas e, sobretudo, do relator, que conseguiu abrir caminho a novas soluções. Neste momento, devo dizer que gostaria que o grande esforço da Bélgica redundasse num sucesso maior do que o que temos agora.
Este fundo europeu foi criado com vista a prestar um apoio complementar aos trabalhadores despedidos em resultado de mudanças a nível do comércio mundial.
Este imposto tributaria as transacções financeiras especulativas para desencorajar este tipo de prática e contribuiria para gerar novos rendimentos destinados aos Estados-Membros da União Europeia.
Este infeliz relatório promove a integração da educação nos objectivos quantificáveis da estratégia reaccionária da "Europa 2020” que têm de ser "transformados” em objectivos nacionais, inscrevendo-a no objectivo estratégico da UE de ganhar a corrida aos monopólios contra outros centros imperialistas.
Este inferno ligado à austeridade tem consequências claras sobre a queda dos níveis de investimento público e de criação de emprego.
Este instrumento poderia ser complementado por uma "caixa de ferramentas” para a Comissão e a entidade legisladora, que deveria ser apoiada através de um acordo interinstitucional.
Este intercâmbio de dados ajuda a criar uma base de dados para analisar a procura de drogas e as actividades secundárias de tráfico de drogas que é vital para a publicação de informação adequada e objectiva que pode ser comparada a nível europeu.
Este isolamento só acabou em 1991, quanto se tornou, finalmente, possível falar sobre o ponto de viragem na história das nações bálticas.
Este mecanismo presta informações importantes, tais como o número de indivíduos envolvidos em todas as actividades pertinentes para o registo e o nível de recursos da UE recebidos pelos registados.
Este mercado constitui uma parte bastante importante da economia da UE, mas as regras e os princípios que regem os contratos públicos variam entre os Estados-Membros, impedindo o acesso das empresas, especialmente das pequenas empresas, a contratos públicos transfronteiriços. No acesso aos mercados de contratos públicos de países terceiros verificam-se restrições semelhantes.
Este montante deve ser atribuído, com carácter prioritário, a projectos apresentados por PME e pela indústria em geral, sobretudo nos domínios do aprovisionamento de energia, do desenvolvimento sustentável e da luta contra as alterações climáticas.
Este método, habitualmente usado no comércio internacional, é uma melhor salvaguarda para determinados sectores sensíveis para a UE e deve, portanto, ser o único método utilizado pela Comissão.
Este novo enquadramento visa fomentar a concorrência e o reforço da integração das políticas da UE para concretizar a Estratégia Europa 2020, favorecendo os mesmos de sempre: os grandes grupos económicos e financeiros e a concentração e centralização do capital.
Este novo projecto de regulamento procura alargar o âmbito do regulamento relativo a transporte rodoviário transfronteiras de notas e moedas de euro entre Estados-Membros da zona euro ao território dos Estados-Membros que se preparam para introduzir o euro. A proposta principal consiste em alargar o âmbito do regulamento relativo ao transporte transfronteiras entre Estados-Membros da zona euro, sem esquecer que existe uma necessidade crescente de transporte de notas e moedas de euro durante a preparação para a transição para o euro como moeda nacional dos novos Estados-Membros.
Este novo sistema inteligente simétrico irá desencadear uma supervisão mais rigorosa, uma apreciação aprofundada por parte da Comissão, do PE, do Conselho e do BCE, e a elaboração de recomendações sobre as reformas suplementares e planos correctivos.
Este não é o caminho. É preciso um plano concertado para defender a moeda única, combater a especulação sobre as dívidas soberanas e denunciar as agências de rating, principais responsáveis pela crise que estamos a sofrer.
Este número ainda é demasiado reduzido quando sabemos que um currículo pode ser significativamente melhorado por um ano passado no estrangeiro, em termos de aprendizagem - sobretudo no que respeita à aprendizagem de línguas estrangeiras - de abertura e de competências. Há três elementos que podem explicar este número: o facto de muitos estudantes não terem sequer conhecimento da existência destas oportunidades para estudar no estrangeiro, o peso de um ano do programa Erasmus no orçamento de um estudante e a complexidade do reconhecimento dos resultados.
Este objectivo ambicioso não foi passível de concretização. Espero que os objectivos da UE 2020 sejam concretizados, nomeadamente o que se refere ao compromisso de a UE investir em I&D 3% do PIB em 2020. A UE 2020 não pode ficar à espera do próximo QFP.
Este objectivo está intimamente ligado ao grau de previsibilidade da ajuda ao desenvolvimento, uma vez que a elaboração de uma estratégia eficaz de desenvolvimento por parte dos países parceiros assenta primordialmente nessa ajuda e, ao mesmo tempo, na mobilização das receitas internas.
Este objectivo poderá ser alcançado se simplificarmos de forma significativa o recurso a créditos europeus, aos quais ainda falta alguma flexibilidade.
Este objectivo, definido em 2007 e dotado de um orçamento de 8,5 mil milhões de euros para 2007-2013, distribuídos por programas transfronteiras, transnacionais e inter-regionais, permite que 271 regiões europeias beneficiem de um financiamento significativo destinado a desenvolver e reforçar programas conjuntos e a superar várias fronteiras e barreiras naturais, tais como fronteiras terrestres e marítimas e barreiras administrativas, que afectam a vida quotidiana dos nossos cidadãos.
Este orçamento crucial é hoje, portanto, um elemento muito importante entre muitos outros, porque, como uma vez mais recordámos, se tornará o motor para converter os nossos compromissos em realidade, o que não é pouco. O orçamento torna-se, portanto, um elemento importante para restituir estabilidade à União Europeia e, também, à nossa moeda única.
Este pacote da governação económica deve demonstrar que a Europa é capaz, que a Europa é capaz de ultrapassar as dificuldades, que a Europa é capaz de precaver problemas futuros. É por isso que tenho muita confiança naquilo que vai suceder nos próximos dias em relação a esta legislação sobre a governação económica. É possível, no Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento de que fui relator na parte correctiva, juntar à ideia de estabilidade e disciplina orçamental a ideia de crescimento. É possível inovar com o procedimento de desequilíbrios macroeconómicos. É possível ultrapassar uma lógica que seja de um simples mecanismo de sanções e é por isso mesmo que a aprovação deste pacote da governação económica levará a mais Europa e a melhor Europa.
Este pacote da governação económica trouxe-nos, por exemplo, em relação à parte correctiva do Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento, uma aplicação mais inteligente desse mesmo Pacto: a atenção ao critério da dívida, a introdução de uma média para a redução da dívida, que seja feita em três anos, criando a possibilidade de flexibilidade no cumprimento das regras; uma lista mais detalhada e mais apropriada de factores relevantes que a Comissão deve ter em conta na análise que faz sobre a situação financeira dos Estados; a introdução de um período transitório de três anos para a implementação do critério da dívida.
Este pacote de reformas da governação económica abafará o crescimento na UE precisamente quando necessitamos de investimento para o crescimento, para a investigação e desenvolvimento e para o emprego, a fim de assegurar o futuro económico da Europa.
Este pacote legislativo não é resposta aos graves problemas económicos e sociais que se vivem em muitos países, que afectam trabalhadores e populações e que têm a sua origem fundamental em políticas comunitárias de cariz cada vez mais neoliberal e de maior concentração do poder financeiro e político.
Este papel abarca o fornecimento de recursos naturais para actividades de produção e de consumo, a absorção de resíduos pelo ambiente e os serviços ambientais de apoio à vida. É muito importante que as contas económicas do ambiente sejam utilizadas de forma activa na elaboração de todas as políticas pertinentes da UE, enquanto factor essencial para avaliações de impacto, planos de acção, propostas legislativas e outros instrumentos importantes do processo de decisão política.
Este parágrafo refere-se manifestamente aos países Mediterrânicos, mas deveria alargar-se de modo a abranger todos os países envolvidos na Política Europeia de Vizinhança.
Este passo, embora pequeno, é um passo na direcção certa e dou-lhe o meu apoio. O relatório do senhor deputado Deß também tem em conta o problema dos agricultores do sector pecuário nos países onde se aplica o regime de pagamento único por superfície (RPUS), a maioria dos quais não possui terras e, por essa razão, não recebe pagamentos directos.
Este país tem vindo a perder valor acrescentado devido à falta de oportunidade de explorar os próprios recursos de pesca. É, no entanto, necessário que sejam estudadas todas as implicações daí emergentes, principalmente a nível económico e social. É essencial ter em conta que o sector da pesca é extremamente importante para a economia mauritana, e que este é um dos países mais pobres de África, sendo financeiramente dependente da ajuda externa e estando sujeito a uma forte instabilidade política.
Este pequeno Hitler de tez morena, que abusou pela última vez do povo húngaro no seu desejo de poder e glória na Europa, foi há muito condenado pelo mundo democrático, civilizado e digno.
Este período de crise e de planos de resgate pode ser o pior momento possível para iniciar negociações sobre as perspectivas financeiras, mas para todos nós, que acreditamos no orçamento da UE como um instrumento necessário para transformar os 27 Estados-Membros numa verdadeira União, o desafio está à nossa frente e a nossa visão deve ser suficientemente ampla para o enfrentar.
Este período é decisivo para o desenvolvimento cognitivo, sensorial e físico, para o desenvolvimento afectivo e pessoal e para a aquisição da linguagem, constituindo também a base para a aprendizagem ao longo da vida.
Este ponto aplica-se especialmente aos grupos migrantes da população, que viajam para o estrangeiro para trabalhar em lugares onde frequentemente não estão familiarizados nem com a linguagem, nem com os regulamentos locais e por isso, naturalmente, não conseguem acompanhar profissionalmente os trabalhadores locais.
Este ponto requer que a União Europeia responda com flexibilidade e rapidez, não só para fazer face às mudanças repentinas em termos de necessidades e prioridades, mas também para garantir a coerência com os novos objectivos internacionais que virão a ser definidos. O Parlamento Europeu deve continuar, como parte deste processo, a apoiar os esforços da Comissão na programação de políticas de cooperação para o desenvolvimento e a reforçar o seu papel no processo de controlo democrático e orçamental.
Este princípio foi apoiado por uma grande maioria na comissão. Importa também que o papel dos agricultores no comércio seja reforçado e que a questão do défice de proteínas seja abordada. A longo prazo, não dispomos de meios para importar de outros países o equivalente a 30 milhões de hectares de pastagem em culturas proteaginosas.
Este princípio, num momento em que a economia europeia está fragilizada e em que a competitividade é mais necessária do que nunca, pode servir para tornar ainda mais caro o transporte de mercadorias, sobretudo para os países periféricos, para os quais ao preço do bem se somam os custos de transporte, que não apenas já são forçados a internalizar os custos com combustíveis como agora terão que fazer o mesmo com os custos adicionais nas portagens, perdendo, assim, competitividade.
Este problema não é novo e motiva constantes interpelações dos membros da Comissão das Pescas à Comissão Europeia. É lamentável que não nos possamos pronunciar de forma vinculativa sobre as nossas prioridades no que respeita à atribuição de fundos europeus a países como a Mauritânia, apesar de o Parlamento ter poderes para exercer controlo financeiro.
Este processo começou já com a aprovação, em 3 de Maio, da Resolução da Assembleia Geral das Nações Unidas, que permitirá à União Europeia participar nos trabalhos da Assembleia Geral.
Este processo foi apoiado por uma conferência organizada pela Comissão no final de Maio, com a participação de autoridades nacionais, grupos de interesses e peritos independentes. A conferência incidiu sobre as práticas fraudulentas de directórios de empresas e, em particular, sobre actividades transfronteiras.
Este processo terá de se basear em elementos práticos, terá de ser submetido a análise de impacto e ter total envolvimento parlamentar, e, assim sendo, tal como referi, já não é altura para falar, pois agora é preciso agir e avançar. Mas há aqueles que ficam nervosos e dizem que é melhor usarmos a ideia como "caixa de ferramentas". Permitam-me dizer a quem tem essa ideia que é preciso ter muito cuidado, pois a minha suspeita é de que uma "caixa de ferramentas" sem um instrumento opcional acaba por ser mais invasivo do direito nacional do que uma "caixa de ferramentas" com um instrumento opcional que seja voluntário, que respeite a autonomia das partes e não comprometa o funcionamento do direito nacional.
Este programa constitui um passo significativo no sentido de garantir uma utilização optimizada e eficiente deste recurso limitado. A política do espectro ocupa um lugar de destaque na Agenda Digital para a Europa e é fundamental para a realização dos objectivos políticos da Estratégia Europa 2020, para o crescimento inteligente, sustentável e inclusivo.
Este programa tem sido sujeito a uma constante revisão pelo novo governo. O Conselho Ecofin analisará o primeiro trimestre de execução do programa na sua reunião da próxima terça-feira, dia 17 de Maio. Não posso adiantar muito acerca desse debate, mas é provável que a avaliação global dite que os resultados da Irlanda correspondem às expectativas.
Este programa tornou-se fundamental para 13 milhões de europeus, cujo trabalho oferece pouca segurança, aliviando-lhes a pressão sobre o seu orçamento alimentar, através de distribuições realizadas por associações caritativas e serviços sociais, e acrescentando à despesa da ajuda apenas 1 mero euro por europeu e por ano.
Este programa visa não só criar uma indústria europeia competitiva e dinâmica para o fornecimento de serviços e equipamentos sem fios em banda larga, como também criar um ambiente propício ao desenvolvimento dos serviços pan-europeus. A banda larga móvel desempenha um papel cada vez mais importante no fornecimento de serviços e na inovação noutros domínios, como a saúde, a educação, a cultura e a administração pública. A harmonização das frequências fará baixar os custos de implantação das redes móveis e os custos dos dispositivos móveis para os consumidores e reforçará a concorrência e a liberdade de escolha do consumidor.
Este projecto de acordo relativo à criação de um registo de transparência tem em conta todos os requisitos essenciais e, por isso, pude apoiar o acordo no seu conjunto. O próximo passo deve ser o de acompanhar os objectivos deste novo registo e combater eventuais dificuldades que surjam de forma imediata e eficaz, no espírito do acordo original
Este projecto de decisão do Conselho sobre a conclusão do Acordo entre a União Europeia e a República da Croácia sobre a participação da República da Croácia no trabalho do Observatório Europeu da Droga e da Toxicodependência (OEDT) é importante, uma vez que a Croácia é um dos principais pontos de entrada das drogas na Europa.
Este projecto de relatório apoia, nas suas grandes linhas, a proposta da Comissão Europeia, nomeadamente no que respeita à necessidade de disponibilizar, em 1 de Janeiro de 2013, a banda dos 800 MHz libertada pela passagem para a televisão digital e a extinção total da radiodifusão analógica da televisão.
Este projecto europeu de vigilância do consumo de agentes antimicrobianos (ESVAC) teve início no terceiro trimestre de 2009. A EMA desenvolveu esforços conjuntos com os Estados-Membros, as agências comunitárias e as partes interessadas relevantes, no sentido de desenvolver este sistema.
Este projecto tem o intuito de fornecer sinais garantidos para utilização civil e assegurar à indústria europeia, a todos os níveis, a possibilidade de competir neste mercado estratégico em crescimento. A quota de mercado actual da Europa, de 25 %, está aquém das expectativas. O EGNOS é compatível com o sistema GPS, mas oferecerá mais possibilidades quando o Galileo ficar operacional em 2013, tendo agora um nível de exactidão dez vezes superior ao do GPS.
Este projecto, que apoio plenamente, não só beneficiou de um financiamento público significativo, como também beneficia do investimento do sector privado da UE em termos de fundos, de tempo e de conhecimentos técnicos.
Este referendo, cujos resultados foram anunciados pela Comissão do Referendo no Sul do Sudão e corroborados pelo Governo do Sudão, terá decorrido, no entender dos observadores internacionais e da UE, de forma justa.
Este regime socialista está por trás da desinformação e falta de informação nessa época, bem como da escassez de dados de que dispomos actualmente. O modelo centralista soviético é grandemente responsável por essa desinformação. Esta fonte de energia e o risco residual e ela associado apenas são admissíveis - inclusive numa base temporária - se estiverem associados ao necessário grau de abertura.
Este registo comum de transparência simplifica igualmente questões para representantes de grupos de interesse, pois possibilitará um único meio de registo em vez de dois, como é actualmente o caso.
Este registo em matéria de transparência pode representar uma pequena vitória, mas também pode ser visto como um passo na mesma direcção adoptada por Washington DC onde o Lobbying Act on Disclosure já existe há algum tempo.
Este regulamento aborda um regime de sanções e a aplicação de multas aos Estados que não cumpram as exigências impostas pela Comissão Europeia com base nos actos delegados.
Este regulamento contribuirá significativamente para o funcionamento do Mercado Interno e reforçará a concorrência neste sector importante. A simplificação e o desenvolvimento do quadro regulamentar actual para o desenvolvimento e a aplicação de novas fibras têxteis irá motivar a inovação nas indústrias têxteis e de vestuário.
Este regulamento deverá ser brevemente adoptado pelo Conselho de Ministros da UE e entrará em vigor no vigésimo dia seguinte ao da sua publicação. Para as regras sobre os requisitos de etiquetagem, como os relativos à indicação de partes não têxteis de origem animal, haverá um período transitório de dois anos e meio.
Este regulamento preocupa-se sobretudo com um regime de sanções e com a aplicação de multas aos Estados que não cumpram as exigências impostas pela Comissão Europeia com base nos actos delegados.
Este regulamento visa estabelecer regras relativas à utilização de denominações têxteis e à correspondente etiquetagem de produtos têxteis, bem como regras relativas à análise quantitativa de misturas binárias e ternárias de fibras têxteis.
Este relatório aborda algumas destas questões, mas, depois, limita-se a procurar impor uma nova tributação sobre os veículos pesados de mercadorias (a somar às actualmente existentes - algumas recentemente aumentadas em Portugal, como as portagens nas SCUT), de eficácia duvidosa quanto à efectiva prossecução dos objectivos enunciados, e representando um encargo adicional, cujos efeitos, em face da actual crise económica e social, poderão gerar situações liquidatárias para muitas empresas.
Este relatório aborda, de forma abrangente, a problemática florestal, focando alguns aspectos que nos parecem importantes.
Este relatório acrescenta um elemento fundamental a uma política europeia que tem de procurar proporcionar aos jovens os instrumentos necessários para serem mais competitivos num mercado de trabalho que se torna cada vez mais globalizado. A concentração na mobilidade dos estudantes deve ser o primeiro passo da criação de mais oportunidades de emprego para os nossos jovens.
Este relatório analisa se a legislação foi bem aplicada pelos Estados-Membros e a maneira como estes entenderam e seguiram as Orientações Estratégicas Comunitárias ao implementar os seus Quadros de Referência Estratégica Nacional e Programas Operacionais. O relatório foi elaborado principalmente com base nos dois documentos seguintes: a Comunicação da Comissão ao Parlamento Europeu, ao Conselho e ao Tribunal de Contas intitulada "Política de coesão: Relatório estratégico de 2010 sobre a execução dos programas de 2007-2013” e o Documento de Trabalho dos serviços da Comissão que acompanha a Comunicação. Foram efectuadas avaliações da implementação dos programas, tendo em conta, para fins de análise comparativa, diferenças de vários meses, na medida em que tais diferenças podem influenciar o volume de montantes atribuídos a determinado sector.
Este relatório apela em termos mais amplos ao reforço das normas laborais essenciais contidas nas convenções da OIT, que abrangem a liberdade de associação e de negociação colectiva, a eliminação do trabalho forçado e obrigatório, a eliminação da discriminação em matéria de emprego e profissão e a abolição do trabalho infantil. O Grupo S&D exige mudanças na governação global e na UE que facilitem o exercício dos direitos dos trabalhadores e melhorem as condições de trabalho. O desrespeito de normas sociais fundamentais de âmbito internacional, que ocorre tanto no interior como no exterior da União, constitui uma forma de dumping social e ambiental que prejudica as empresas e os trabalhadores europeus.
Este relatório apoia a proposta de alteração do artigo 51.º do Regimento do Parlamento Europeu relativo ao processo de reuniões conjuntas das comissões. Efectivamente, dada a importância da questão processual, não é possível resolver as incompatibilidades textuais existentes no artigo recorrendo apenas à interpretação.
Este relatório aponta os caminhos a seguir no que respeita a este Programa-Quadro de I&D, devendo este ser articulado com a Estratégia Europa 2020, mas também com a iniciativa União da Inovação, tendo como principal objectivo as áreas das alterações climáticas, da política energética, da competitividade e do envelhecimento da população. Se conseguirmos atingir os objectivos aqui definidos, não tenho dúvidas que entraremos num novo ciclo económico de crescimento.
Este relatório apresenta diversos aspectos pertinentes na avaliação intercalar do 7.º Programa-Quadro em matéria de investigação e desenvolvimento tecnológico, destacando-se a preocupação de assegurar a participação de 40 % de mulheres investigadoras, sendo que, actualmente, esse valor não ultrapassa os 25,5 %, além de reconhecer que a Europa continua a registar um atraso em relação aos EUA e está a perder a posição de vanguarda que tinha relativamente às economias emergentes. O relatório também lamenta que a maioria do trabalho científico na UE ainda seja realizada em condições laborais precárias.
Este relatório avalia a performance do Instrumento de financiamento da cooperação para o desenvolvimento (ICD), mas noto a importância do mecanismo que lhe deve suceder ainda este ano.
Este relatório centra-se nos aspectos essenciais do funcionamento do Mandado de Detenção, salientando, pela primeira vez desde que entrou em funcionamento em Janeiro de 2004, os seus sucessos e lacunas.
Este relatório constitui uma boa orientação para as propostas legislativas, pelo que felicito o seu relator. Não obstante, há algumas propostas que me preocupam e que irei acompanhar com particular cuidado na sua evolução. Refiro-me à redistribuição das ajudas, que considero dever ser feita intransigentemente, apenas no âmbito do primeiro pilar e com base em critérios puramente objectivos, para que o sentido da redistribuição não venha a ser subvertido por via de critérios de correcção que apenas tenderão a manter a situação actual.
Este relatório contribui para orientar acções conjuntas de recolha de dados neste domínio, analisando resultados e propondo soluções. Pretende-se um quadro completo que indique quando, onde, como e em que animais foram os medicamentos antimicrobianos realmente utilizados, sem criar novos encargos financeiros ou administrativos para os agricultores ou outros proprietários de animais, tendo em conta que as práticas e a intensidade da pecuária divergem consoante o Estado-Membro.
Este relatório contém alguns aspectos positivos de denúncia do constante desrespeito dos direitos dos trabalhadores e do trabalho decente por parte das multinacionais, da necessidade de se integrar horizontalmente a política social em todas as políticas externas da União Europeia, incluindo a chamada Responsabilidade Social das Empresas (RSE).
Este relatório contém propostas concretas e pragmáticas, decorrentes das reivindicações no terreno, emanadas dos muitos intervenientes por nós ouvidos e das expectativas dos cidadãos.
Este relatório contém várias propostas com esse objectivo: melhorar a comunicação entre empresas e universidades, conciliar os programas e as estruturas das universidades com as necessidades específicas do mercado de trabalho e introduzir nos programas de estudos estágios profissionais de elevada qualidade que sejam devidamente remunerados e respeitem os direitos sociais dos jovens.
Este relatório de iniciativa insta a Comissão Europeia a identificar claramente as deficiências do quadro actual e a proceder a um estudo de impacto definindo as diferentes alternativas para melhorar o sistema, incluindo legislação nova, caso seja necessário.
Este relatório de iniciativa surge no seguimento da Comunicação da Comissão Europeia relativa a uma União da Inovação e é uma das iniciativas da Estratégia UE 2020, com o objectivo de estimular a inovação e a competitividade através da criação de políticas firmes que estimulem a troca de ideias e soluções para diversos problemas transversais a todos os Estados-Membros.
Este relatório de iniciativa é dedicado à questão da mobilidade dos jovens para fins de estudo, que decorre da estratégia "Europa 2020". É, sem dúvida, correcto aumentar a competitividade dos jovens através da criação de condições no quadro da educação universitária para que permaneçam pelo menos um ano noutro Estado-Membro. A mobilidade, um sistema de reconhecimento de créditos e outras medidas limitarão o aumento do desemprego entre os jovens, cuja taxa média na UE se situa actualmente em 21 %, o que é assustador.
Este relatório de iniciativa, no qual o comité de redacção competente incluiu diversas propostas da Comissão da Cultura e da Educação, visa galvanizar a UE e os Estados-Membros para o cumprimento dos objectivos da Estratégia "Europa 2020”, em particular no respeitante ao emprego e à formação. São tidos em conta desafios específicos como a procura de cada vez maior de qualificações no mercado de trabalho, o que põe em risco os empregos pouco qualificados, o aumento exponencial do desemprego dos jovens, que em alguns Estados-Membros, incluindo a Grécia, ultrapassa os 30%, e a falta de medidas dos Estados-Membros destinadas a facilitar o cumprimento dos objectivos definidos no quadro da Estratégia "Europa 2020” (por exemplo, a redução da taxa de abandono escolar precoce para 10% e o aumento da proporção dos jovens com educação superior para 40%). Juntamente com a protecção social dos cidadãos menos qualificados ou com menos instrução, precisamos urgentemente de investir em novas competências, especialmente as requeridas para os empregos nos sectores estratégicos para o crescimento.
Este relatório defende a criação de um quadro estratégico único para o FEDER e outros Fundos Estruturais, nomeadamente o FEADER e o FEP, já a partir do próximo período financeiro após 2013, assim como a sua coordenação com outros instrumentos da vertente externa das políticas da UE. Deverá ser tido em conta que ao criar um quadro estratégico único poder-se-ão perder especificidades e a diversidade de áreas e sectores beneficiados, abrindo caminho à restrição do orçamento comunitário e à redução das verbas dos Fundos, como têm defendido as grandes potências da UE.
Este relatório demonstra uma vez mais como é importante para o desenvolvimento europeu promover a mobilidade dos nossos jovens em todos os sectores. O alinhamento dos programas de estudos com o correspondente reconhecimento mútuo tem de ser alcançado em todos os domínios da formação e da educação, em particular nas profissões artesanais, em que há muito terreno para recuperar.
Este relatório envia uma mensagem clara: a União Europeia tem de integrar uma estratégia coerente e coordenada para a cultura na sua política externa.
Este relatório exige mudanças na governação global e na UE que facilitem o exercício dos direitos dos trabalhadores e melhorem as condições de trabalho, apelando ao reforço das normas laborais essenciais contidas nas oito convenções da OIT relativas à liberdade de associação e de negociação colectiva, à eliminação do trabalho forçado e obrigatório, à eliminação da discriminação em matéria de emprego e profissão e à abolição do trabalho infantil.
Este relatório faz igualmente referência à liberalização dos vistos para os Estados dos Balcãs, que também foi uma medida bastante imprudente.
Este relatório faz parte do pacote de seis diplomas legislativos sobre a governação económica e revela as contradições que se vivem na União Europeia. A verdade é que não basta identificar desequilíbrios macroeconómicos nos Estados-Membros se não houver políticas comunitárias alternativas de solidariedade e de coesão económica e social para colmatar os tais desequilíbrios.
Este relatório foca-se sobre o painel de indicadores estatísticos macroeconómicos e estruturais, que permitem as comparações entre os Estados-Membros, reflectindo as tendências estruturais e a curto, médio e longo prazo.
Este relatório insta a Comissão a publicar mensalmente as contas dos governos nacionais.
Este relatório introduz a expressão-chave, "poluidor-pagador", o que significa que as alterações ao regime de portagens no transporte rodoviário nos permitirão adicionar os custos reais da poluição atmosférica e sonora provocada pelos camiões aos impostos e taxas a cobrar quando os veículos pesados de mercadorias utilizam as auto-estradas.
Este relatório não responde aos desafios do futuro que o seu título enuncia, mas sobretudo ele não responde aos graves problemas do presente, por isso apresentámos um conjunto de propostas de alteração que consideramos imprescindíveis para uma profunda modificação da actual PAC.
Este relatório pretende assegurar que os Estados-Membros cumpram os limites do défice e da dívida estabelecidos no Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento.
Este relatório pretende estabelecer um conjunto de medidas de coacção que permitam corrigir desequilíbrios macroeconómicos perigosos na zona euro. A panóplia de instrumentos vai dos depósitos remunerados à aplicação de multas e, desse ponto de vista, insere-se perfeitamente na filosofia punitiva do conjunto do pacote, de que discordo.
Este relatório pretende prolongar o acesso excepcional ilimitado ao mercado da UE, com isenção de direitos, à quase totalidade dos produtos originários dos países e territórios que beneficiam do chamado Processo de Estabilização e de Associação. O pretexto é o de revitalizar as economias dos Balcãs Ocidentais graças a um acesso privilegiado ao mercado da UE, considerando-se que o desenvolvimento económico que daí resultar favorecerá a estabilidade política em toda a região.
Este relatório pretende, assim, simplificar e clarificar o direito da União Europeia, que se encontra disperso em numerosas disposições, já sujeitas a diversas alterações, dificultando a compreensão das mesmas. A transparência do acervo comunitário é um dos objectivos da União, como forma de aproximar a Europa aos cidadãos, para que estes possam beneficiar dos direitos específicos que lhes são consagrados.
Este relatório prevê que os Estados procedam a depósitos remunerados ou paguem multas, no âmbito da vertente preventiva e correctiva do Pacto de Estabilidade e Crescimento.
Este relatório propõe a adopção de um sistema de medição claramente definido que complemente o produto interno bruto enquanto indicador do desenvolvimento social global. O instrumento complementar deve ter aplicação prática e assentar em indicadores claramente definidos e em dados fiáveis. Só assim o PIB poderá dar um contributo suficiente para o debate político e o processo decisório. A Comissão é, portanto, convidada a apresentar uma estratégia global e gradual que explique como a nova abordagem pode ser utilizada de forma pragmática no trabalho político quotidiano.
Este relatório propõe a alteração do artigo 51.º, após a conferência dos presidentes ter chamado a atenção para as limitações do Regimento no que respeita às reuniões conjuntas das comissões. O relatório inclui uma proposta de alteração do Regimento, segundo a qual as condições de aplicação do artigo 51.º seriam verificadas com maior atenção e de acordo com critérios mais rigorosos, inclusivamente pela conferência dos presidentes. O facto de as reuniões conjuntas apenas se poderem realizar quando a questão se revestir de importância significativa assegura que não terá lugar uma aplicação injustamente excessiva de um processo que, pela sua própria natureza, é excepcional.
Este relatório propõe a extensão da votação por maioria qualificada "invertida" para multar os Estados-Membros cujas políticas não estejam em conformidade com os padrões euro-liberais.
Este relatório recorda-nos que, se a UE pretende tornar-se líder mundial em matéria de política social, é imperioso que salvaguarde a coesão entre as políticas sociais aplicadas nos diferentes Estados-Membros.
Este relatório refere-se à entrada da Bulgária e da Roménia no acervo Schengen, concluindo-se, através de visitas de avaliação e um relatório final, que ambos os países estão aptos para a plena adesão. No entanto, existem ainda questões pendentes, em particular a necessidade de estabelecer um plano para lidar com a possível pressão migratória ilegal.
Este relatório refere-se à proposta de directiva que estabelece os requisitos aplicáveis aos quadros orçamentais dos Estados-Membros e constitui um dos mais graves atentados à sua soberania.
Este relatório responde às necessidades dos consumidores e das pequenas e médias empresas, que, ao contrário de outros intervenientes que representam entidades económicas de maiores dimensões, têm dificuldades óbvias em aceder ao mercado interno, devido aos enormes encargos associados.
Este relatório retoma a inaceitável exigência de um lugar na Assembleia Geral da ONU e um lugar permanente no Conselho de Segurança, decorrentes do antidemocrático Tratado de Lisboa e de uma personalidade jurídica com ele adquirida. Não é com o objectivo de tornar mais democrático o funcionamento de ambos os órgãos da ONU ou para criar uma nova ordem mundial mais justa que a maioria do PE o faz.
Este relatório salienta, no entanto, que a dimensão cultural das acções externas está ainda pouco desenvolvida e coordenada, e que é necessário adoptar uma estratégia comum e coerente neste domínio.
Este relatório sobre a proposta de regulamento do Parlamento Europeu e do Conselho relativo às medidas de execução para corrigir os desequilíbrios macroeconómicos excessivos na área do euro destina-se a formular um plano de acção para impedir que se verifiquem novas crises financeiras como a que envolveu recentemente a Grécia e complementa, assim, um conjunto de outros relatórios apresentado no mesmo pacote de governação económica. O objectivo geral do relatório, ou seja, o reforço da coordenação entre as economias da UE, é certamente louvável, mas o mesmo não se pode dizer dos mecanismos através dos quais se pretende atingir tal objectivo.
Este relatório sublinha a necessidade de se desenvolver a cooperação a nível europeu no domínio do ensino e da formação profissional para melhorar a transparência e a comparação entre os diferentes sistemas de ensino.
Este relatório sublinha especialmente a necessidade de manter o estatuto predominante do pilar transfronteiras e de desenvolver incentivos que estimulem os grandes projectos transfronteiras e transnacionais, tais como as redes transeuropeias de transporte (RTE-T). Estas são recomendações com as quais estou plenamente de acordo e gostaria uma vez mais de elogiar a qualidade deste relatório, que conseguiu reunir um amplo apoio entre os partidos.
Este relatório surge na continuidade do relatório Lyon, anteriormente elaborado, sobre as linhas gerais para a reforma da PAC, e da comunicação da Comissão sobre a PAC, cujas linhas essenciais acolhe favoravelmente. Não obstante aspectos importantes, que valorizamos, como a recusa da diminuição do orçamento global da PAC ou a proposta de manutenção dos direitos de plantação da vinha, o conteúdo do relatório é profundamente negativo, defendendo uma PAC cujas consequências estão bem à vista no rumo de declínio e destruição da agricultura portuguesa.
Este relatório tem por objectivo estabelecer uma primeira posição do Parlamento no que respeita à produção de um novo Instrumento de financiamento da Cooperação para o Desenvolvimento, com base no Regulamento anterior.
Este relatório torna claro que o Parlamento partilha o ponto de vista da Comissão sobre a importância de uma política do espectro radioeléctrico coordenada e eficaz com vista a atingir os objectivos da banda larga.
Este relatório vai, ainda que timidamente, no sentido de potenciar e complementar o PIB como instrumento de medição e avaliação do desempenho social e económico e, por associação, do progresso das sociedades, pelo que votei favoravelmente.
Este relatório vem reconhecer vários problemas existentes na política de coesão, começando pela conclusão tardia das negociações sobre o Quadro Financeiro Plurianual e o pacote legislativo e tendo como consequência um atraso na realização das estratégias nacionais e dos programas operacionais, a insuficiência dos montantes previstos para o período de 2007 a 2013- nomeadamente tendo em conta o alargamento da União Europeia e a utilização de apenas 27,1% dos recursos disponíveis no actual período - assim como a manutenção do co-financiamento nacional nesta altura de crise e a carga burocrática.
Este relatório visa identificar os desafios modernos, em especial em termos de nível de vida, que se deparam aos cidadãos da UE que vivem em áreas urbanas.
Este relatório visará coordenar a abordagem da UE na gestão do espectro em toda a União. É importante que os Estados-Membros continuem a manter negociações e comunicações bilaterais com países terceiros, a fim de alcançar os objectivos da União relativos à frequência.
Este relatório é mais um elemento a juntar à estratégia europeia para a política de juventude. É correcto apoiar a internacionalização dos estudos e a flexibilidade no emprego dos jovens trabalhadores num mercado de trabalho cada vez mais competitivo.
Este relatório, em concreto, analisa a questão dos défices excessivos dos Estados-Membros e visa as preocupações do conjunto da União Europeia no sentido não só de colmatar os défices, mas também ao nível da dívida pública, por forma a assegurar que sejam levados a cabo procedimentos com vista a corrigir a infracção desde cedo e assim impedir que medidas correctivas tenham lugar já tarde. A aplicação das medidas é fundamental para a zona euro.
Este relatório, no qual me revejo em termos genéricos, versa sobre esta importante questão. Aliás, muitas das propostas contidas neste relatório, como por exemplo o fomento de programas de intercâmbio juvenis e o reforço da aproximação às organizações da sociedade civil de países terceiros, são propostas que eu próprio defendi e vi aprovadas pelo plenário no meu relatório sobre a Revisão da Política Europeia de Vizinhança-Sul.
Este relatório, que apoio totalmente, faz bem em sublinhar a importância da agricultura quer do ponto de vista do desenvolvimento alimentar e rural, quer do da preservação da terra. A PAC já passou (e bem) por uma reforma radical no passado: os novos desafios que enfrentamos têm que ver com uma maior simplificação e entendimento.
Este relatório, que faz parte de um pacote de seis relatórios para a governação económica na UE, pretende criar mecanismos preventivos e de correcção, evitando a ocorrência de défices orçamentais e dívida excessivos.
Este relatório, tal como os relativos às disposições aplicadas aos tractores, tem como objectivo levar a cabo a codificação da Directiva 80/720/CEE, de 1980, referente à harmonização das legislações dos Estados-Membros sobre o espaço de manobra, as facilidades de acesso ao lugar de condução, assim como as portas e janelas dos tractores agrícolas e florestais de rodas.
Este reúne realizadores da Coreia à Austrália, passando pela Bulgária e pela Suécia, e é palco de variadas co-produções. A cidade não só manteve o seu carácter intercultural como o tem impulsionado, não obstante o meio político circundante se aquartelar cada vez mais em trincheiras étnicas. Só por isso, a cidade merece uma oportunidade de demonstrar o seu imenso potencial intercultural.
Este sector, na sua globalidade, tem experimentado uma enorme expansão desde a primeira disponibilização de serviços GPS a partir das instalações de satélite americanas em 2000.
Este sistema contribuirá para um melhor desempenho nos domínios da saúde e da segurança públicas, bem como nas operações de natureza administrativa.
Este sistema deverá seguidamente ser alargado a todo o continente europeu, assim como aos países da Parceria Euro-Mediterrânica e também ao Médio Oriente e a África.
Este sistema tem por objectivo apoiar os jovens na procura de emprego no mercado de trabalho europeu e apoiar os empregadores no recrutamento de jovens trabalhadores europeus em mobilidade.
Este tema recorda imediatamente o caso dos trabalhadores destacados.
Este teste de esforço será não só um teste aos bancos, mas também à credibilidade da nova estrutura de supervisão. A Comissão fica contente com o facto de que os testes de esforço abranjam quase 85% do sector bancário nalguns países, enquanto que noutros mal vão além de 50%? Ora, essa é uma estatística deveras singular, e tenho curiosidade em ouvir a sua explicação relativamente a este ponto.
Este texto hipócrita alega que o principal problema do sector das agências de notação de crédito são os entraves à concorrência. A solução que propõe para a dependência excessiva dos bancos destas agências é que os próprios bancos avaliem os riscos.
Este texto tem o mérito de levar em conta os efeitos potencialmente negativos dos OGM.
Este tipo de práticas tem sido alvo de queixas apresentadas por empresas ao Parlamento Europeu. É por isso que também solicitamos à Comissão Europeia que verifique como os Estados-Membros transpuseram as disposições da Directiva 2006/114/CE relativa à publicidade enganosa e comparativa. O Parlamento Europeu solicita igualmente que a questão dos directórios de empresas enganosos seja contemplada numa revisão dessa Directiva.
Este tipo de reforma e de alteração do processo de selecção corresponderia a uma reforma do FMI de harmonia com as transformações sobrevindas no plano das relações económicas globais e daria aos países em desenvolvimento a possibilidade de fazer com que a sua experiência nas relações com o FMI fosse tida em conta na definição da evolução futura deste.
Este tornou-se menos burocrático, e penso que os investigadores e outros que lidam com estes projectos estão conscientes disso, mas ainda há muito mais a fazer. E creio que, de certa forma, podemos depositar uma confiança maior nas universidades que já existem há séculos.
Este trabalho deve ser complementado pela criação de estruturas modernas de cuidados infantis e educação para crianças e por uma formação de elevada qualidade para pessoas que estejam à procura de trabalho.
Este voto envia uma mensagem clara e forte ao Comissário responsável pela Agricultura e pelo Desenvolvimento Rural, Dacian Cioloş. Se a política agrícola da União Europeia visa garantir o abastecimento de produtos alimentares seguros e de elevada qualidade e contribuir para a protecção do ambiente e a produção de energias renováveis, ela deve ser adequadamente financiada, de modo a incentivar os agricultores a utilizarem técnicas modernas e respeitadoras do ambiente. O combate à especulação em produtos agrícolas de base e a extrema volatilidade dos preços exigem uma solução global que garanta uma maior estabilidade para os agricultores e o abastecimento em larga escala de produtos alimentares seguros.
Este é apenas um breve resumo das medidas que estão a ser executadas para fazer face ao impacto da crise financeira global na UE e em três Estados-Membros em particular.
Este é apenas um primeiro passo rumo a relações transparentes entre as Instituições europeias e os representantes de grupos de interesses. O registo deverá ser obrigatório, e o Conselho deverá também associar-se a este acordo o mais rapidamente possível.
Este é mais um relatório que integra o pacote dos seis diplomas legislativos da chamada governação económica. A visão integrada deste conjunto legislativo justifica o nosso voto contra todos e cada um dos relatórios que o compõem.
Este é mais um relatório que também reafirma, no fundamental, o apoio às políticas externa e de segurança e defesa comum da União Europeia. São sobretudo políticas de defesa de interesses económicos e geoestratégicos das potências europeias, cada vez mais em convergência com os EUA e a NATO, deixando para segundo plano a cooperação e a ajuda ao desenvolvimento.
Este é o momento não só de tentarmos compreender os problemas uns dos outros, mas também de respeitarmos as diferenças que existem entre nós. No início desta semana, manifestei claramente a minha opinião de que não seria responsável da parte do Parlamento entrar em confronto directo com o Conselho sobre uma questão que eu teria dificuldade em explicar ao cidadão comum.
Este é o momento para a Comissão coordenar a execução do Plano de Acção de modo a evitar duplicação a nível dos Estados-Membros, e assegurar o progresso geral na multiplicidade de domínios de actuação da União Europeia abrangidos pelas aplicações GNSS. O sistema EGNOS deve cobrir a totalidade da União Europeia e, com carácter prioritário, deve ser alargado às regiões Sul, Este e Sudeste da Europa.
Este é o nosso debate anual sobre política externa e, no ano que vem, esperamos que a avaliação da situação de direitos humanos produza resultados claros e esperamos ver progressos significativos no desenvolvimento de uma cultura dos direitos humanos em todas as actividades do Serviço Europeu para a Acção Externa.
Este é o objectivo do pacote relativo à governação económica, do qual faz parte este relatório da minha colega, a senhora deputada Ferreira. O relatório trata da prevenção e correcção dos desequilíbrios macroeconómicos e advoga uma supervisão reforçada.
Este é o objectivo do pacote relativo à governação económica, do qual faz parte este relatório do meu colega, o senhor deputado Feio. O relatório trata da aplicação do procedimento relativo aos défices excessivos.
Este é o primeiro debate geral importante que mantivemos com Catherine Ashton e, se olharmos para trás, vemos que era já então claro que alguns governos não queriam que se utilizasse o título "Ministro dos Negócios Estrangeiros da União Europeia", o que levou a que se escolhesse a denominação de "Alta Representante". Isto é compreensível, porque, paralelamente à política fiscal e à política interna, uma política externa independente é uma das características fundamentais, pode até dizer-se uma característica identitária, da soberania nacional.
Este é o único relatório que procura contrariar a tendência dominante no conjunto do pacote da coordenação económica. A minha abstenção sublinha e valoriza este aspecto. O relatório de Elisa Ferreira ocupa-se da prevenção dos grandes desequilíbrios macroeconómicos.
Este é outro exemplo dos esforços da Comissão Europeia para simplificar e regular o acervo comunitário, de forma a torná-lo mais transparente e acessível aos cidadãos da UE. A proposta legislativa codifica os textos existentes e cria um acto legislativo mais claro e acessível.
Este é um acordo extremamente benéfico para ambas as partes, com impactos positivos ao nível empresarial, dos investidores e consumidores igualmente, graças ao vasto campo de aplicação em causa.
Este é um assunto que também estamos a tentar clarificar, mas o que procuramos, neste momento, é simplesmente prorrogar o regulamento temporário até ao final das perspectivas financeiras.
Este é um dos desafios mais difíceis que se colocam à Europa, e é vital que os Estados-Membros não respondam reduzindo o investimento na educação. Temos de zelar por que os nossos jovens possam aprender e viver no estrangeiro para prosseguirem a sua aprendizagem, se assim o pretenderem, uma vez que investir hoje na educação irá preparar melhor a UE para enfrentar os desafios do futuro.
Este é um dos relatórios sobre a proposta de directiva que estabelece os requisitos aplicáveis aos quadros orçamentais dos Estados-Membros, constituindo um dos mais graves atentados à sua soberania, situação que será ainda mais grave para aqueles da zona euro que sejam considerados em défice excessivo, e que, além da vigilância permanente, por parte da Comissão Europeia, poderão ser sujeitos a sanções.
Este é um dossiê que mostra um equilíbrio frágil entre os interesses da indústria de transformação da carne e da indústria agrícola e os interesses do consumidor.
Este é um importante requisito para assegurar que o novo quadro estabelecido à luz da reforma da governação económica é credível e eficaz. Não é, contudo, necessário ser demasiado rígido ou extremista; os incentivos para os Estados-Membros também são uma boa ideia.
Este é um momento muito importante, pois as novas autoridades de supervisão financeira vão entrar em funcionamento.
Este é um primeiro passo importante - e essencial - de um longo processo.
Este é um relatório muito importante relativo não apenas ao meu país, a Bulgária, mas também à União Europeia no seu conjunto.
Este é, naturalmente, o quadro que já foi delineado durante do processo de referendo. É importante que isto continue, a fim de assegurar que a vontade política de ambos os Estados e da comunidade internacional seja posta em prática sob a forma de verdadeiros projectos de desenvolvimento para os cidadãos dos dois países. São os cidadãos e o seu bem-estar que devem ser o principal foco da democratização, do pluralismo político e do respeito pelos direitos humanos e pela diversidade religiosa, cultural e étnica tanto no Sul como no Norte do Sudão.
Este último deve ser promovido pela UE nas suas relações com outros países e ser objecto de uma acção coerente entre as duas dimensões: a interna e a externa. O texto aprovado insiste, em particular, na necessidade de promover a responsabilidade social das empresas.
Estes 5% constituem um exercício de realismo político e devem formar a base da futura negociação interinstitucional, em conjunto com a proposta sensata apresentada neste relatório, acordada entre os grupos desta Câmara, sobre o novo sistema de recursos próprios.
Estes acordos podem ser divididos em três grandes categorias: acordos horizontais, que alinham os acordos bilaterais de serviços aéreos em vigor; acordos globais, que procuram assegurar condições de concorrência equitativas; e, por último, acordos de segurança, destinados a garantir um nível elevado de segurança da aviação civil.
Estes aperfeiçoamentos reflectem uma realidade clara: a UE e os seus Estados-Membros são os maiores doadores de apoio financeiro ao sistema da ONU, representando os fundos da UE 38% do orçamento regular da ONU, mais do que dois quintos das operações de manutenção de paz da ONU, e cerca de metade das contribuições para os fundos e programas da ONU.
Estes aspectos estão igualmente associados às prioridades definidas pela União Europeia para os próximos anos. Só é possível realizar progressos no sector científico, na energia, nos transportes, na governação económica ou nas tecnologias digitais se eles forem apoiados por políticas europeias comuns.
Estes aspectos poderão constituir parte da resposta mas, como os senhores deputados afirmaram, a discussão, tanto aqui como nos Estados-Membros, terá de ser muito aprofundada.
Estes casos são indissociáveis de uma PAC que promove modelos de produção intensiva de cariz exportador e que inviabiliza, em lugar de promover como seria necessário, a produção e o consumo locais, susceptíveis de garantir uma rastreabilidade muito mais efectiva e, logo, maior qualidade e segurança alimentar.
Estes confrontos foram acompanhados do recurso à força e de incêndios, e acabaram com várias pessoas feridas, incluindo agentes da polícia.
Estes controlos poderão conduzir a recomendações aos Estados-Membros para que levem a cabo acções imediatas, estabelecendo prazos para a sua execução. O aumento da confiança mútua entre Estados-Membros reduzirá igualmente o recurso, por parte dos mesmos, a iniciativas unilaterais de reintrodução temporária das fronteiras internas, assim como reduzirá o recurso à intensificação de controlos policiais nas zonas das fronteiras internas.
Estes créditos existem e penso que devem ser utilizados para um apoio mais eficaz ao desenvolvimento da economia real, da inovação e do emprego.
Estes dados ajudar-nos-ão a considerar se algo beneficia o ambiente e se, ao mesmo tempo, beneficia a economia, ou se algo beneficia a economia e, ao mesmo tempo, beneficia o ambiente e, por conseguinte, também o nosso ambiente social.
Estes depósitos de petróleo produzem três vezes mais emissões de carbono do que o petróleo convencional e a sua exploração é também extremamente prejudicial para o ambiente local, além de uma ameaça para as comunidades das Primeiras Nações que vivem na região.
Estes desenvolvimentos da situação social preocupam-no? São uma questão política relevante.
Estes deveriam incluir um indicador pecuniário, como, por exemplo, desembolsos líquidos ajustados, e um indicador físico, como uma pegada ecológica ou de carbono, para a dimensão ambiental, bem como indicadores sociais, que integram a dimensão social, como uma avaliação da desigualdade (por exemplo, o coeficiente de Gini) e um índice da integração social e da prosperidade humana, como o Índice de Pobreza Humana.
Estes dois aniversários lembram-nos quantas coisas mudaram na Europa e como nós, europeus, fomos capazes de abrir caminho a mudanças na Europa Central e Oriental com perdas mínimas, mudanças essas que culminaram na reunificação da Europa Oriental e Ocidental.
Estes dois domínios são absolutamente necessários para o desenvolvimento da competitividade da UE no seu conjunto e para o funcionamento do mercado interno e, como tal, merecem particular atenção durante a elaboração do orçamento.
Estes dois últimos aspectos são, naturalmente, de grande importância para a Comissão do Controlo Orçamental.
Estes eurotítulos destinar-se-iam a reforçar a disciplina orçamental e a aumentar a estabilidade entre os mercados, bem como, tirando partido do aumento da liquidez, a assegurar que os EstadosMembros que beneficiam dos níveis de crédito mais elevados não fossem prejudicados por taxas de juro maiores. O relatório será acompanhado, se assim se justificar, por propostas legislativas.
Estes factores terão, a médio prazo, impacto significativo nos custos da energia, e será necessário avaliar as suas repercussões na actual estratégia ambiental europeia.
Estes factos, associados às implicações imediatas e importantes no sector dos transportes, que incluiu, designadamente, sistemas avançados de assistência ao condutor, motivam o meu voto favorável.
Estes fundos terão de ser financiados pelos contribuintes líquidos, por outras palavras, os cidadãos trabalhadores alemães, franceses, italianos, neerlandeses e austríacos, através dos seus orçamentos nacionais; as primeiras reduções dolorosas já se fazem sentir nestes países. A população dos países economicamente fortes da UE está indignada - pelo menos tão indignada como os manifestantes de Atenas - porque tem de apertar o cinto a bem dos Estados PIIG (Portugal, Itália, Irlanda e Grécia). A exigência de aumentos do orçamento nesta situação difícil está desfasada da realidade e é escandalosa. Não precisamos de um orçamento da UE excessivo que é porventura dez vezes superior ao necessário; não precisamos de um orçamento financiado pelos contribuintes da UE que perdeu totalmente o sentido da necessidade de realizar economias; não precisamos de mais um aumento da burocracia que deixa os contribuintes líquidos na penúria.
Estes grupos defendem que as normas do direito nacional dos contratos não são um facto que influencie as atitudes dos consumidores no que respeita a efectuar compras a partir de outro Estado-Membro; na realidade, existem outros obstáculos genuínos ao comércio transfronteiriço, nomeadamente diferenças administrativas e culturais, e uma falta de vias de recurso para os consumidores. A senhora deputada Wallis não apresentou provas conclusivas da necessidade de um instrumento opcional.
Estes grupos, e cito na íntegra o relatório da Europol, "procuram expandir os seus interesses na UE, e poderão explorar oportunidades na eventual adesão da Bulgária e da Roménia ao espaço Schengen". O Director da Europol, Rob Wainwright, declarou numa entrevista que "a eventual adesão da Bulgária e da Roménia ao espaço Schengen e a liberalização dos vistos para a Ucrânia - poderiam ser entendidas como potenciais novas oportunidades para a criminalidade organizada". Temos o dever, perante os nossos cidadãos, de ponderar com seriedade as advertências da Europol. O Acordo de Schengen já está a abrir todas as portas da Europa à criminalidade organizada e à imigração ilegal.
Estes incluem um quadro jurídico para o Semestre Europeu e a supervisão dos programas de reforma nacionais, a independência dos gabinetes de estatísticas nacionais e as multas por fraude, as missões de supervisão da Comissão, um diálogo económico entre todos os intervenientes e uma transparência substancialmente maior em todo o processo.
Estes indicadores não só permitirão medir a qualidade de vida com maior precisão, como também proporcionarão uma base de conhecimentos mais fiável, o que contribuirá para melhorar a análise das políticas nos diferentes domínios.
Estes jornalistas estão a ser retirados em massa dos meios de comunicação social públicos e, por outro lado, representantes do Governo procuram encerrar o jornal diário independente, detido por privados, Rzeczpospolita, que é o segundo maior diário de qualidade da Polónia e é crítico, aliás, da posição do Governo.
Estes novos critérios, que se prendem com incompatibilidades com as políticas estabelecidas da União ou com os princípios gerais da União definidos no artigo 21.º do Tratado, podem ser vistos como uma porta aberta para todos os tipos de requisitos adicionais a cumprir pelos acordos bilaterais existentes.
Estes números são o espelho de uma necessidade fundamental de boas políticas europeias para a floresta e do seu aproveitamento e sustentabilidade, não apenas ambiental, mas também como recurso económico fundamental.
Estes objectivos constam igualmente da Estratégia "Europa 2020”, quando esta estabelece a obrigação de nos concentrarmos na consecução de um crescimento inteligente, sustentável e inclusivo.
Estes objectivos foram confirmados pela posição do Conselho, sendo agora igualmente desejável que a Comissão tome medidas que favoreçam um desenvolvimento sustentável e duradouro dos transportes, a cooperação, um sistema harmonizado de cobrança de portagens e a internalização dos custos externos.
Estes objectivos só serão concretizados com uma Política Externa e de Segurança Comum eficaz e partilhada por todos os Estados-Membros da UE.
Estes pagamentos são importantes no contexto da planificação a longo prazo.
